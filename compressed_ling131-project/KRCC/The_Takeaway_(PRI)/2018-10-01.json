in Germany star Spiegel magazine in American Woman named Catherine my your guy is speaking out for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel in Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examine by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story and she says the lawsuit documents that she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are signed by rebel do himself\nOr NATO denies the allegations and it's called the story quote unquote fake news his lawyers have said that they will sue the magazine joining me now to discuss this issue arena Ahmed freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down podcast Shereen thanks for being with us\n[noise] Hi thanks for having me ... and we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go over the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your gut and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin Oregon is actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about this occurred in two thousand nine\nShe was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which is a policy I guess you get to his entourage\nSo he according to the dare Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warnings for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that\nSo she was there to party which is a policy I guess you could see his entourage\nSo he according to deter Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nChristie honoring all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and ... and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed the police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh what's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost in the so coupled with her own trauma and the\nYou know mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players and aspiring at that time so it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not\nAs experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story it this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly is because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in a sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere it made no waves they think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examining we pitched this story to about sixteen different outlets and\nSo I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere made no waves they think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examine that we pitched this story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nI mean I don't know and that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think this is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted to them or nobody want to destroy and I'm like how can this not be possible but this is the first time this happened to me the same thing with David ... the current goalkeeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated\nAnd and and it's ongoing they that the uh the u._s. implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nThat we we should also be clear though that that heated that run all do has responded and denying these allegations right\nOf course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my or a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in NDA like let's not forget that that happened then she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nDo speak all would not and this is something we have to address and we talk about media would not have printed that saved dotted the ice and cross the T's and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those team was going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago they haven't even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nWell I Know you're right and it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment as me to moment a particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for exams\nThey got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that your speakers would not and this is something we have to address and we talked about media would not have printed that step daughter the ice and cross cities in legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those teams going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nWell I Know you're right and it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry or is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world another issue so I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant she was given the basic you know a pass by the media which is complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to see that her story is being shared now\nSyrian Ahmed is a freelance sports writer and co host of the burn it all down pod cast Shereen thanks as always for being with US Bank\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ...

Vega here with you on the takeaway\nStarting today sixteen year old and New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal court next to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year as a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail\nHave to be moved out by two day New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge change it to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nThan he covers urban affairs here in our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high ten Xena fit to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right\nThat's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're phasing it in to this is the start of the law said this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been especially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm if the case involves sexual assault if it involves an Easter\nThat's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're phasing it in so this is the start of the law said this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been especially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm it's the case involves sexual assaults if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to a family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that than the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year old now have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening yes that's true too so another thing to mention is that\nThis law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving a prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a free or national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx\nAnd so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change [noise]\nSo there's ... there's been ... years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in ...\nGoing to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx and so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\nSo there's there's been said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them in the head repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named ... Browder who is in Rikers in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed but he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on Pete his family couldn't meet that three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer gone Herman from the New Yorker it got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is sort of the backdrop of where we are today\nAnd there's been lots of talk particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan\nTo essentially shutdown Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course we're all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand [noise]\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down Rikers Island\nIs probably going to be contested very hotly how does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down Rikers island's going to be controversial so the plan is that\nThe city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up new jails in Burroughs um so these would be ... that are more integrated into the community\nUm to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these deals are flooded for and there's been\nTremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned clique prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people in and out\n[noise] um right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and say that\nI'm mass bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people\nUm they were trying to raise five million dollars and the bailouts are supposed to happen throughout the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting\nThe city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning process has been guided by this principle [noise] Finney Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you ... um\nAnd today ... is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners now that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting\nThe city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning process has been guided by this principle city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you tend to you know\nTo comment for this show up on our Facebook page sweetest ... or leave us a voice mail at eight seven seven eight my take\nYour ideas on tanks are a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about this is the takeaway\n[noise]\nIf you are looking for something to do in the Ninety One point five care cc listening area check out the community counseling care she C. dot ORG and you can submit your event there as well\nEither this is my age who is this is Jonathan from your the dominant ... from the motion\nMusic that each candidate Nightline any one point five hey I keep the\nProgramming on Ninety One point five K.
