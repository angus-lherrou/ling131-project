evaluate how a president is doing this to look at whether he's filled the promises he made as a candidate but we also know voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership temperament comports himself in the job\nBut today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail\nAnd whether he's comes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get into [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe begin with foreign policy\nSo I Do believe that Trump had had an extremely consequential foreign policy presidency so far in ways that are often underrated by the way both by critics of his advice of orders\nThat Susan Glasser staff writer for the New Yorker\nShe has almost singlehandedly because even his own party largely does not support much of this agenda on foreign policy in particular he is more or less singlehandedly\nReorientate American foreign policy seems to me away from me rules based or values based foreign policy and toward an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world are much more Machiavellian great powers\nPolicy and towards an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world a much more Machiavellian great powers the might rule the strong do as they will kind of view of the world\n[noise] well this is I think that the biggest challenge are you still hear from many inside the Trump administration's foreign policy world essentially versions of do pay attention to the tree to pay attention to the policy\nHR McMaster used to tell people that well what happened to him he got fired Rex Tillerson used to say well I don't even pay attention to the treats the guy got fired by a treat so that got the world's attention\nWell this is I think that the biggest challenge are you still hear from many inside the Trump administration's foreign policy world essentially versions of do pay attention to the treats pay attention to the policy\nH R McMaster used to tell people that well what happened to him he got fired Rex Tillerson used to say well I don't even pay attention to the treats the guy got fired by a treat so that got the world's attention\nAnd in my view you know that's not a realistic thing anytime your analysis of foreign policy is essentially don't pay attention to the unvarnished thoughts of the most powerful men in the world\nYou're probably going to make some huge analytical mistakes and I think that you know Trump again has been fairly consistent in certain areas of expressing preferences that are then translated policy if you didn't think he was going to withdraw from the Iran deal\nAs some serious foreign policy people thought are convinced themselves you were wrong is lesser thanks for joining us he keeps

twenty sixteen campaign pick up now on trade [noise] then candidate Trump rent out a message and blow it up a bad deal\nI'm going to tell\nThe barn and I intend to immediately renegotiate in terms of that agreement I Am going to withdraw the United states right\nThe Trans Pacific partnership and I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify\nEvery violation of a foreign country and his current using the harm due to the American worker\nSo how has he done you've had the very tough and very consistent in some ways anti free trade anti globalization and specifically anti China views that Trump's a candidate Trump the president to put\nThat Susan Glasser again he pulled out of the TPP the Trans Pacific\nPartnership which was the major regional trade deal negotiated in the course of the Obama administration that was meant to be the major American and its allies response to Chinese economic and increasingly security a muscle flexing in the region\nThere's been no clear strategy to replace that except to engage in that escalation on the economic front and here's Alex lesson lot three sixty senior reporter on international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has carefully gone about sort of restructuring America's trade deals and I say carefully only in the sense that\nWhile he would tell you that these are historical groundbreaking rewrites of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more weedy and a little more nuanced than that so let's get into that new want most recently of course they has\nRewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stopped\nLawson not three sixty senior reporter on international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has carefully gone about sort of restructuring America's trade deals and I say carefully only in the sense that\nWhile he would tell you that these are historical groundbreaking rewrites of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more weedy and a little more nuanced than that\nSo let's get into that nuance\nMost recently of course they has rewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stops short of I think's curing all the ills of the old NAFTA that Trump ran on doing on fixing\nIt is definitely an improvement in the sense of just people conduct business differently than they did in Nineteen Ninety four when it came into effect\nBut here's the thing to understand a lot of what they agreed to in the new NAFTA deal was already part of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement negotiated under President Obama that President Trump withdrew from\nCanada and Mexico we're in agreement that was considered Obama's NAFTA rewrite he also promised to rewrite NAFTA on the campaign trail in two thousand eight\nUm and that was waiting for Trump when he got there but instead of picking it up and asking Congress to pass it immediately withdrew the United states in the trade agreement he said it was terrible he never really gave specific on what he did it in a light so it's a little disingenuous I think for him to say none of this happens without me and the way I impose these tariffs to apply pressure on them that's just not the case\nThe one thing that are two issues at the Trump Administration points to specifically the auto sector and on dairy and parrots or these brand new topics that the president was able to negotiate into this new NAFTA deal\nYou have touched on the to at least that are the most difference now there was a lot of work done on improving dairy market access into Canada in GDP\nWe got a little bit more in this new NAFTA but it's by you know a couple of different decimal points but the automotive rules are very interesting um it Heather's tariffs benefits for cars to a minimum wage of at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nWhat about terrorists early in the president's administration there was a lot of hand wringing especially from folks on Wall street some people within the president's administration saying we gotta stop all this Paris talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we knock this really great\nTo but it's by you know a couple of different decimal points but the automotive rules are very interesting it's Heather's terrorists benefits for cars to a minimum wage but at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nWhat's going to Paris early in the president's administration there was a lot of hand wringing especially from folks on Wall street some people with in the president's administration saying\nWe gotta stop all this Paris talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we knock this really great economy off the rails so\nThe economy still seems to be doing quite well and the president hasn't stopped talking about parent does that mean the president has succeeded in using parents as a tool for getting what he wants for the U.S on trade\nWhile you're correct that the economy is still very robust and growing\nBut I Would say and many economists will tell you that the strength of the U.S economy is what is shielding the president from the adverse effects of terrorists not it's growing because of terrorists and as far as what he was hoping to achieve it seems entirely political to me at this point we began by talking about what he campaigned on and talk trade enforcement in the form of tariffs was part of that\nYou know I Will counter unfair trade practices by several partners namely China but it's it's manifested in other partners as well and that's what's happened\nBut it's not really forcing anyone to the negotiating table you know he claims that NAFTA doesn't happen without terrorists but as I just laid out these are two of our closest allies they will always sit down and talk with us\nAnd asked us now basically what you're seeing is a terrorist beginning to take root and the most rapid escalation has been with China that the terrorists know coverage hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods and those are beginning to recover consumer goods the last round of tariffs started to cover all electronics computers furniture or things like that\nConventional economic theory tells you that you're going to start to see prices raise on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you\nThe forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that but what does it actually do for us that's sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that\nBut on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything they can point to say the terrorists got you act you know there's really no they're they're\nThe other thing the president talked a lot of that as a candidate was the issue of the trade deficit and how large it was\nThe prices raise on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you the forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that but what does it actually do for us that's sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that\nBut on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything that can point to say the terrorists got you act you know there's really no there are there\nThe other thing the president talked a lot of that as a candidate was the issue of the trade deficit and how large it wise has\nThere been a significant change in the trade deficit since he's been president\nYet a significant changes that it has actually gone up quite a bit since he's come into office it's been an interesting tight rope for critics to walk because while he said I'm working on reducing a trade deficit um it continues to climb\nBut at the same time critics also said when he made those arguments the trade deficit\nIf it's high isn't really like necessarily a bad thing for our economy in many contexts it can be the mark of a very healthy economy because consumers are embolden to buy things the Trump Administration and President Trump himself continues to frame this as sort of a like\nA bank accounts right it's just like look at us losing all this money you either not understanding or willfully distorting the fact that it's actually just private companies and citizens who want to buy things with their money it's not like we're flushing money down the drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it\nThe other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate and he still does today which is to say listen I'm a free trader I'm not anti free trade I'm just fair trade if you had to grade this president on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand how anybody could look at two years of like rapidly and largely unprecedented since the Nineteen thirties largely unprecedented escalation of of tariffs both with allies and with countries were more contentious with and say\nThirties largely unprecedented escalation of of tariffs both with allies and with countries were more contentious and say\nThis is a free trade president

C. dot org\n[noise] somebody said the other day\nWas the first thing you're going to [noise]\nWell we're working really on repealing Obamacare\nSince the campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news and host of the what the health podcast and she tells us how well he's done so far\nThe administration has done quite a bit actually so did Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass their repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance to the individual mandate penalty\nThe president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested\nPart of the law that gave special discounts to lower income people people with incomes below two and a half times poverty although in the end the insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that ended up giving not only those people discount but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it all out\nBill after they were unable to pass their repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance the individual mandate penalty the president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested\nPart of the law they gave special discounts to lower income people people with incomes below two and a half times poverty although in the end\nThe insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that ended up giving not only those people discounts but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it allowed\nDifferent kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits than are required under Obamacare um they're called short term planting some they're called association health plans\nAnd the concern is that healthier people will move into these kinds of plans because they're cheaper but the problem is they don't offer very much and sometimes it's not entirely clear what they don't offer until you discover that you need something so those are sort of the big things that have happened to the law in the last year um\nPresident likes to say the law is dead and then the next breath like say but we fixed it and he also talked a lot\nAs a candidate saying that the health care premiums are going up one point he said they're going up to forty fifty fifty\nFive percent they're still talk from the White House and Republicans that premiums are still skyrocketing what do we know about premiums on the exchanges at this point\nWell actually very interesting we premiums next year for twenty Nineteen are going to go down slightly about one and a half percent the average premium in the states that are run by the the federal government which is most of them\nWhat analysts say is that they would have gone down considerably more if not for some of the changes that the administration has made so the administration trying to have it both ways like look we made premiums go down and actually other things made premiums go down their actions made premiums mostly go up the\nOther thing we see is a change in\nPolling and perceptions of the Affordable CARE Act back during the campaign plurality of voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later\nAnd the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nI feel like twenty Seventeen and the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it\nIt's mostly go up the other thing we see is a change in polling and perceptions of the Affordable CARE Act\nBack during the campaign plurality of voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later and the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nA I feel like twenty Seventeen and the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it taught people what was in it I'm basically a top people what was in it by suggesting what they were going to lose\nA particularly things like protections for preexisting conditions expansions of Medicaid that had helped a lot of middle class people not just poor people do little caused people who are you know uh being expect to take care of their aging parents um their Medicaid has proved to be much more popular than I think Republicans\nRealized um so it was it goes too much more than the laws much larger than just a five percent of people who are in these individual markets buying insurance\nAnd I think people actually learned just as it was getting ready to go away that maybe these are things that we actually would like to keep around\n[noise] so what happens in twenty Nineteen the Republicans have said if we keep control of Congress we're going to go at it again we're going to take another repeal vote\nYou have Democrats many of them are running this year on something they call Medicare for all saying that they are going to make that a priority should they take control of Congress should really can you help us understand what could really possibly happen including Nineteen\nIt's interesting that it's sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was intended to be a middle of the road moderate plan market basic could attract some\nModerate Republicans which in the end they didn't but that was that was the idea now we're seeing sort of both sides going to their corners Republicans\nSaying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying yeah maybe this compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage\nCall it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive and they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act with a nice thing but people are still hurting and ...\nSo I'm going to their corners Republicans saying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying yeah maybe this compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage call it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive\nAnd they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act with a nice thing but people are still hurting and we need to do something more dramatic so you know what you end up with and are are are these sort of polar opposites and it's hard to see where there could be any middle ground where something could pass at least in the immediate future\nThe discussion about Medicare for all has been very active on the Democratic side\nThe president himself took to USA Today he penned in an op ed where he argued that this proposal of Medicare for all is going to totally destroy Medicare as we know it for seniors\nAnd that it's basically a form of socialism what do we know about the president's plan\nFor Medicare uh especially since we know that this is a big driver of government spending and there seems to be discussion\nEvery year about its potential bankrupting the country or renting out of money so where does he seemed to be going with discussions on this\nI'm actually surprised that just didn't come up until now Medicare has been a a a traditional issues or Medicare scare tactics have been traditionally issue for Republicans in midterms um because older people tend to vote in larger numbers in midterms\nAnd this goes back to twenty ten when the Republicans were trying to undermine the Affordable CARE Act they were not so much arguing about the the parts of the law that we think of as Obamacare\nThey were arguing about all the money that the ... cut out of Medicare\nUm ironically in the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly cuts to provide her payments for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law but there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things and the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommends more cuts to Medicare again mostly the provider payment\nThe ... cut out of Medicare um ironically in the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly cuts to provider payments for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law but there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things and the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommends more cuts to Medicare again mostly to provider payments um but for the president to then go out and bashed the Democrats for having\nCut Medicare and the Affordable CARE Act yeah that that doesn't really work for the Republican now the argument that Medicare for all will undermine Medicare is a relatively new and that seems to be the favorite Republican line of attack it's like\nThey will not only make America you know a socialist program they will get rid of Medicare for seniors to um at least on your most of the Medicare for all bills we've seen seniors would get more benefits and have to pay less\nHow the country could afford it is a debate that needs to be had\nBut it's a little bit of an of an odd scare tactic to say that that seniors would lose Medicare if the country went to Medicare for everybody\nTo really wrap our thanks for joining us my pleasure\n\nOn the next fresh air filmmaker and writer John Waters and new
