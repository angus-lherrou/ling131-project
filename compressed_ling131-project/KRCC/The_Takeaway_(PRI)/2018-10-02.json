attack the student\nGone with\nThe truth of what the fraud\nThat sound from CBS reporting that as the students gathered at the three cultures plaza for a demonstration in Mexico city the Mexican government fired on the protestors the exact number of dead and disputed but estimates say they were close to three hundred killed ...\nIs Nicholas you don't ... it looks like well did you mean those are those are today\nIt's well known that the events of October second precipitated the end of the movements in a bloody matter but it's you and it was repression got to this day has not been

they movements that are surge than the universities in the central part of the country you're seeing a new generation but his waking up to the struggle through social consciousness\nAnd it is also a generation that remembers and knows that through the state there has been no justice in those responsible for the massacre have not been brought to just listen to what was your most are getting on your your body\nTo understand more about the massacre and what we've learned about fifty years later is Kate Doyle she's a senior analyst at the national Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate thanks for joining us\nThank you ... so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today fifty years ago\nThere was a real by student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer

from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement grew in strength and the demands became sharper and more articulate it\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students\nWith the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during a protest meeting in the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured\n[noise] there were reports at the time that armed snipers were up in surrounding buildings and shot towards the plaza which then forced a military response what do we know about what exactly happened there\nSo there was a very aggressive stance on the part of the president ... that the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking ... square just simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and arrest hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and I'm Wondering when you see\nYou know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there and between what happens in Mexico today versus fifty years ago\n[noise] sure but I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity or from the government today I think they are pouring into the streets because\nFour years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of Colorado\nAnd disappeared and have never shown up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government and in fact the Mexicans just [noise]\nThanks students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity or from the government today I think they're pouring into the streets because\nFour years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and they've never shown up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party nor even the sort of\nDominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change and if demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on this is sufficient and is it a step towards justice\nNo it really is and the government can emission that recognize that is is a new and important commission that is was set up by the current government opinion yet to to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat is not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local Mexico is a long way away from fully\nEmbracing the state's role in killing young people on October second Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd right now the government is even trying to censor and withdraw records that have been available and its archives for some years now about ... loco so Mexico has a long way to go before it is able to really face what happened on

conversation is about consent and the consequences when consent is not given\nAnd for those of you with young one's listening or those who might be upset by conversations around sexual assault this material it's explicit and could be triggering\nI remember when I was about Eighteen and know the guy who's a friend of mine who I just thought it was the most beautiful parts in the wild and we had gone out one night we'd been drinking a lot\nIt wasn't until I turned around and saw him naked in a\nHe's I think my clothes off and pushing my head down that I really thought of really you know a tiny part you wanted to do that\nIsrael you and there's a correspondent for advice on HBO it was her own experience years ago that motivated her to make a new documentary film called consent\nI remember saying to him I don't really want to have sex\nI remember him kind of taking that as a cue to convince me\nIt wasn't until I turned around and saw him naked and uh\nHe saw a thing my clothes off and pushing my head down that really you know tiny puppy you wanted to do that\nIs ... is a correspondent for advice on HBO it was her own experience years ago that motivated her to make a new documentary film called consent\nI remember saying to him I didn't really want to have sex\nRemember him kind of taking that as a cue to convince the\nBut the film explores more than just the conversations required before a sexual interaction in this current moment of me too and the emergence of decades old sexual assault allegations in the public arena\nYoung says we need to also be thinking about how to better deal with the trauma of the past and what does that reckoning look like in some cases she says it looks like dialogue I think\nThat's more awareness I ... I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we start talking about what consent looks like from cells in our daily lives and our insect flies in and day thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I still do it is essentially an agreement between nobody to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define which is one of the things we found out in the peace and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we throw it in the peace with a ... you know needing to have a solid yes\nBefore you move forward with any kind of um sexual interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because I Would just spell any kind of confusion around this topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to have a yes when you started someone's\nHand when you get someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a norm for sexy and very month is maybe we need to start redefining then\nAnd then the question becomes all part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate place to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help too\nThink about it you know needing to you have a yes when you started someone's hand when you kiss someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a norm the sexy and ... months or so maybe we need to not redefining them\nAnd then the question becomes well part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it's suddenly depends on your situation how about trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario paying out\nWhat we tracked in this documentary is a case of two adults who ten years ago had sex one person who thought consensual sex the drunken incident won't puffing crude about rape and they sat down and had a face to face conversation\nI told myself that was a dream and and that the things I thought I insane and ... just a real like really not not wanting to face the next level of this line of questioning\nTheir soccer I don't remember how I got into a room why I came into your room one happens any of those details\nWitnessing that was incredibly powerful very very moving role conversation with a lot of vulnerabilities and a lot of humanity and forgiveness that was well ...\nWhat's going to you and I became\nA source of problems in our community the source of like a ... can imagine I I didn't want to see like that no one could imagine you like ethanol over their chest and so by the fault\nEveryone will have to have to do anything ... anything got to keep everything was

to\nRosa and she\nJust started doing this but\nIt's interesting because at the time when we're talking about ... accountability looks like I mean we really\nEvery everybody [noise]\nOne of my biggest regrets throughout office is in addition to you know holding you've gotten married and causing a trauma ... ten years of opportunities to\nRaise our hands are [noise] are\nJust started you in this process\nIt's interesting because at this time where we're talking about ... accountability looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options how to handle situations that often happens years ago or even decades ago um I thought this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own called the person or I just\nKnow that something was up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I thought that it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice as to um [noise] yeah I mean that's a ... it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... station\nUm it can be seen as a too soft and approach but some people I mean some people do deserve to go through the criminal justice system this is just an old tentative option that I wasn't aware of before making the documentary and that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness in a way that that's the end goal but is it\n[noise] no I mean I'm In charge of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgive or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just let it go there obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure\nAnd this is definitely not a building and the solution for everyone I Would say that they're all limited options because you know as we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us in when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so [noise]\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgive or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation on whether they want to just let it go there are obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure\nAnd this is definitely not a built in ... everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know that's the only the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us and when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so\nWe have very limited options but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase hair\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort of gray area of consent did that experience make you change the way you think about trauma\nI think that it's an interesting time to talk about trauma if the last few days ... anything it's that trauma is real and lasting and can run extremely deep I've been surprised over the last year will tell you that that experience has had a lasting impact and that I Do find myself thinking back to not\nVery uncomfortable moment than I thought I'd left behind a long
