as we heard a lot I'm under this administration from the president of the United states that you know we've seen from the Muslim ban 'em to pointing fingers at groups that are violent like MS Thirteen that have a terrible um have committed terrible acts of violence as the real threat here and yet\nIn just one week uh we've seen three uh attacks that were homegrown these were\nViolence as the real threat here and yet in just one week uh we've seen three of attacks that were homegrown these were domestic ah acts of terrorism and violence so what our who is really the biggest threat to our domestic security right now Bruce\nWorld through things first sully the twenty first century has turned out to be enormously in short time on any number of levels both in terms of political violence and terrorism but also in terms of\nAn order that is rapidly shifting and you know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's the most threat they're all threatening and they're all bad because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nBruce I never I I have to say I'm not going to say my age but I Will say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and thought I was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days with the they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what we said earlier throughout the United states history at times of great this of this polarization alienation\nWe have seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war in the late Nineteen century during the period of industrialization and modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another certainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nI think that you know terrorism and hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society and what we're seeing right now and you're quite right it is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memories but don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't on the news is in terms of the violence unprecedented but in terms of the mood that both you and brief described I mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely erode it\nVery let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\nIt's when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events [noise] well\nI think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant in this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who are trying to vote\nPart of the problem of lumping white supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as his lab at Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not a majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have come we have made a lot of progress from\nWhere we were in the past but to discuss what is happening now in a way that discounts be centuries and generations of this type of violence that we have seen in this country again I just I don't see the value in doing that\nBruce I Want to bring in I'm just really quickly here we know that law enforcement focuses on social media profiles our law enforcement focusing on far right extremists [noise]\nWhat law enforcement to to my knowledge is certainly follow federal law enforcement or particular resort we following this and certainly concerned about it and understand completely that social media has led to\nThe you know preventing not just of the courses most extreme most odious conspiracy theories and ... towards tape but also served as a rallying cry for people who might have been isolated voices in the past and had no traction and their views\nTo inspire and motivate and ultimately\nI debate or provoke others to engage in violence so I think keep something that's taken incredibly seriously the question is what\nOf age and ultimately I debate or provoke authors to engage in violence so I think it's something that's taken incredibly seriously the question is what the host of those social media sites what they're also doing\nTo police what's put on their sites and that I think until very recently has been something that was a vacuum medicines very little was done an obviously much more needs to be\nAnd breathe just to to round out the conversation here we know that far right wing extremism as you've mentioned in white supremacist violence has lasted for has existed in this country for a very long time I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how this is a reflected in almost in in white male rage in many ways\nI think that's definitely a component of it I think that our society socialize is some of us to have the expectation of having less rights I'm less access less ability to things I think that we need to create a society\nThat provide opportunities for every one part of this clashing that is going on right now I'm\nIs people feeling like things are collapsing that they are not um having the same kind of economic opportunity that they once had and people are starting to fight and clashed with each other again what is unique about the United states is that in our history\nThere has long been this ideology that the United states is reserved for white people particularly for white men\nI'm In one of the other things that we see coming up and a lot of these incidents is that there's a history of violence against women among many of these perpetrators and that should not be dismissed or overlooked either\n[noise] Bruce Hoffman is a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the council on Foreign Relations and brand new some bath as an artist and community organizer in North Carolina thinks she both think he will not just\nMy name is Bridget I live in Pittsburgh, PA squirrels hill area and I'm really angry and really sad\nAnd it was very frightening [noise] but it also proved to me how strong our community is when everybody turned out for the visual light and it's just making us stronger we all need to be together and I think the most important thing is we have to start voting for people\nTo get involved with that will change the gun laws\nSupport for the

next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map it happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level\nHere to explain more is Denise Ross barber she's a managing director of the national Institute on money and politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the\nTwenty twenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and re draw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional districts need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming mid term election\nIn the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps so it's a fairly important\nProcess that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors what are you seeing as far as money is concern\nAddition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat [noise]\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to\nDuring the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to ballot PT there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip based on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to end the R C has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gay fifty thousand dollars in supportive uh Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races certainly\nThe what we're able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective it was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legit\nIt's also swung Republican and I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us you want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is overlooked or misunderstood or not understood it all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically ... [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of ... and it's really\nA game that played primarily by the insiders are the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are paying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the Andy RC\nAre very aware of it Denise Roth barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us thank you very much and\n\n\nThe take away is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction presenting fiber cloud starring Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free her captured journalist son also starting math Omer and eating out though in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program bubble teachers practical conversation and Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available maps or or online at B.
