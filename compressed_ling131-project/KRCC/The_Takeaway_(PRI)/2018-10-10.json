five of those years in ... city\nIn that time she noticed glaring proficiency problems\nWhen I was teaching for great people just two men and cannot read kinetic because if you can't reach kind of math you can do anything\nAnd she says there was widespread instability\nWhat I'm saying and out of school and in public school is to a tunnel they're saying sometime before they can finish in one school year and they have gone through three or four teachers\nSo after retiring from teaching Johnson decided she wasn't done being an educator this past July she used her retirement money to open up a preschool in Yahoo city\nMy dream here yes we'll get the academy\nNot just a place that you can bring a child to be made to actually to learn how to read and how to be portrayed as

the abandoned in America series that we've been highlighting all week yet is any school district\nThe municipal school district there is one of the worst in the state of Mississippi and that's one of the reasons why we decided to go there to talk to the people there to find out how they feel about their education system and to find out what can or is being done about it\nNow you visited four of the districts public schools can you tell us or described for our listeners a little bit about what you saw what were the conditions like so few of the schools\nAre actually and very good shape they are modern there's new tables in the high school cafeteria\nAnd those were in good shape the oldest building and used by the district is Webster elementary school and this is for\nChildren who are just starting out this is for pre K. kindergarten and first grade students and the desks were marred for years of use their bathroom was a partially out of order\nThere with peeling paint in the hallways and you could tell that you know it had been repeated and repeated and repeated over and over again this is the facility where the heating system had gone out a couple of years ago and some parents tried to pay to have it fixed I tried to help the school district\nAnd um then beating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his child up early from school so it's in it's in rough shape and the issue is that they don't have\nThere are there just isn't a tax base there it's it's very low they don't have a lot of income coming in so they don't have resources to pour into this old facility\nLet's talk a little bit about um race and how the demographics of the schools are playing into what you saw down their\nShirt so what I found in my reporting is that in Mississippi does this happen has happened across the state [noise]\nForty nine of a hundred and forty five school districts are more than three quarters African American Nineteen districts are more

a hundred and forty five school districts\nAre more than three quarters African American Nineteen districts are more than three quarters white um so the schools there have re segregated in in a big way and this was particularly true in Yahoo city where in Nineteen Seventy I'm black students entered white schools for the first time\nAnd they're\nAfter that period\nWhite students started going to private school or they moved out to ... county and the school district there now is Ninety eight percent black\nAnd if you look across the state of Mississippi none of the districts that are more than three quarters block R. Rated a or B none of the districts that are more than three quarters white R. Rated the or half the gravity of the situation cannot be overstated\nNow is that you mentioned that the tax base but is that really the only reason why the schools are where are you seeing the discrepancies in schools is that only financial what else is driving this\nSo there's a there's a lot of people by their health and Poverty Law center and it was filed in twenty Seventeen it's on hold right now I'm actually a judge in Mississippi [noise] decided that\nThe state of Mississippi couldn't be sued over this but I'm the lawsuit is against the state and it says they still have the

Carlotta thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him over the years was that he was well connected to the government and he had served in the government\nYou become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way\nAnd then lately he taken out of a post with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile\nIn his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and the side as we see clearly now with his fate and you've been\nHe was well connected to the government and he had served

to sources within the Turkish government car lot of what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and\nThey talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that clearly giving it to John honest to publish that those\nTwo groups of Saturday's that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and\nThese officials that came flew in on private planes and left the same day I'm the sort of Saudi officials are Turkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in\nIn in a different times that day and they left the same day and the Turkish officials are saying they were essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the Turks have now\nMounted an investigation they're asking for access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that ... are also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nDetails are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among\nYou can access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that are also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment we know they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building putting them in biblical [noise]\nUm we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all and the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the Turks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so everybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based\nHas been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states has made you know at least the president has pulled no punches in his day and I think for many I'm In the press and that\nAttack on press freedoms

... story that you feel are telling the truth or not telling the truth um it just feels really difficult with these types of pieces to understand where to look\n[noise] um it it is difficult and not least in Turkey where not only you know the president of the usa criticized John us but the president turkey often criticizes journalists including foreign journalists like me working here\nUm but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the press or banning pressed from working or even share as journalists I'll put in prison [noise]\nThis is altogether different league because it's not only an act against a journalist who was clearly\nA disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticisms but to dispose of him breaking international law I'm In another country\nAlso be disposing of him in the country or take him out of the country but it's it's completely I'm a different league of of what we we have seen from coming in from US President on on the touch presidents so it's also averted shocked the talks here both in government on in society\nI think the government or radio gold because they knew ... well he was he counted among his friends
