the director of the Brennan Center for justice program and she explains the evolution we've seen in the last few decades when it comes to criminal justice reform\nThe issue of Mac and ... and I think started back in the sixties and seventies and particularly got very bad in the eighties and nineties when crime basically became a politicized issue so at that time there was an increase in crime particularly in cities and politicians responded to that\nNot only campaigning on it but then in acting extremely harsh criminal law\nThat weren't necessary to bring down crime so we had Congress and states\nPassing things like three strikes are outlaws turning a misdemeanor into felonies abolishing parole and then you had the war on drugs that dot punished the youth and sale of drugs extremely harshly\nSo between Nineteen Seventy four and two thousand the prison population quadrupled\nThis wasn't just one party that was using this rhetoric are campaigning on these issues can you talked to was a little bit about how\nDemocrats and Republicans talked about crime during this era and how they talk about crime now both parties Democrats and Republicans were\nThen you had the war on drugs that dot punished the youth and sale of drugs extremely harshly so between Nineteen Seventy four and two thousand the prison population quadrupled\nThis wasn't just one party that was using this rhetoric are campaigning on these issues can you talk to us a little bit about how Democrats and Republicans talked about crime during this era and how they talk about crime now\nBoth parties Democrats and Republicans were very much campaigning on being tough on crime and you saw this with um George Bush you also saw this with Bill Clinton where they really did make being tough on crime\nI'm a campaign issue and they were competing for who could be the most tough on crime what's really interesting is that now the dynamics of this is really different so starting in about two thousand eight\nAround um the recession states we're going through a budget crisis and Republicans started really leading efforts in states to reduce the prison population\nAnd Democrats actually joined them after that\nThen you saw in about twenty sixteen so in that election where you saw every single politician running for president except for Donald Trump coming out strongly in support of criminal justice reform so at that point it seemed like there was a political consensus going in the opposite direction than had been going for so many decades\nThe difference between sentencing reform\nPolicing reform it seems there that we do have a pretty big Gulf at least whether it's on public opinion or politically about how policing is performed versus the sentencing for people who've already been arrested and their life after they leave prison\nSo when we talk about criminal justice reform I think generally people are talking about\nThe idea of reducing the prison population and that can be done in many different ways it can be done in reducing the number of people we arrested that can be done by reducing than and says it can be done by releasing people into parole and so there are many different ways to attack that problem\nThe Gulf you're pointing out\nThere is a strong bipartisan consensus and public consensus around reducing sentences that seems to be something that people can\nFor reform I think generally people are talking about\nThe idea of reducing the prison population and that can be done in many different ways it can be done in reducing the number of people we arrested that can be done by reducing fan and says it can be done by releasing people into parole and so there are many different ways to attack that problem\nThe Gulf you're pointing out\nThere is a strong bipartisan consensus and public consensus around reducing sentences that seems to be something\nThat people can understand to for example so there is a movement in Congress right now it's actually led by Dick Durbin and Chuck Grassley to reduce sentences and this is something that\nHas been supported by the president and it's supported by politicians on both sides so that seems to be slightly less controversial than this idea of policing reform and can you have meaningful sentencing reform criminal justice reform with out having policing reform\nI think you need policing reform it\nBut I Do think you can take significant step simply through sentencing I'm so for example we actually just came out with a report that showed that about forty percent of prisoners are in prison without a justifiable public safety reason\nAnd that through sentencing reform alone you could cut the prison population by that amount\nAnd feel they're a state or states that have made some significant reforms in recent years\nYes so there are many states so last year alone there were Nineteen states that past fifty seven pieces of bipartisan legislation to reduce their prison population and one example that people frequently uses the example of Texas\nBecause that was something where they did a lot of comprehensive reform awhile back and they are considered one of the leaders on this issue and that's I think that's surprising to to most people\nRight so it's not necessarily a blue state red state thing they are red and blue states that are passing these reforms yeah absolutely\n[noise]\nThere's a real disconnect between members of Congress and what's happening in their own backyards and that's highly Harris executive director of justice action network that's a group working\nSo for for a while back and they are considered one of the leaders on this issue and that's I think that's surprising to to most people right so it's not necessarily a blue state red state thing they are red and blue states that are passing these reforms yeah absolutely [noise]\n\nI think there's a real disconnect between members of Congress and what's happening in their own backyards and that's highly Harris executive director of justice action network that's a group working on bipartisan criminal justice reform oh he's a conservative herself\nShe used to be the general counsel to the Kentucky Republican parties and according to Holly I'm a state level Republicans are helping to lead the charge gets really conservative Republican governors that have been moving forward in an aggressive way\nActually are are having her here in Kentucky is\nZealous advocate for reform um and you know we've passed just during his tenure\nA felony expungement bill a abroad reentry bill the dignity bill that will improve conditions for incarcerated women so\nUm you know at the governors in the states and really get it and it doesn't hurt that it's also good for their budget and they've got to fund education and and they're concerned about economic development and quite frankly\nWith the hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars that you can save through reforms\nYou know you can invest more in those places and quite frankly if we invested more than those places maybe we wouldn't see as many people entering our justice system we have to take a

take a couple of weeks where we're talking about\nA lifetime appointment the latest this afternoon on all things considered from NPR [noise]\nOr cc [noise] when you have a district attorney in a city or county who doesn't really see justice the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible\nThis year there's a grassroots movement to elect more progressive more diverse district attorneys Sean King is the cofounder of real justice pack\nFor years king worked as a civil rights activists after the shootings of black men and women by police and despite his incredible success on social media\nWasn't seeing much success in bringing about policy change\nMainly lost\nThose battles for justice\nFor Eric Garner from my brown\nLater for Tamir Rice for John Crawford for Freddie Gray for for Sandra Bland and in all of these fights we kept fighting for justice and losing and it caused me really in early twenties Seventeen to say\nWhy the hell are we losing so much when it seems like we're on the right side of history it seems like we're even on the right side of\nOf ethics morality integrity decency but nobody is being held responsible and it caused me to land kind of square and the space of saying\nHey I think a huge part of the problem\nFor Sandra Bland and in all of these fights we kept fighting for justice and losing and it caused me really an early twenties Seventeen to say\nWhy the hell are we losing so much when it seems like we're on the right side of history it seems like we're even on the right side of\nOf ethics morality integrity decency but nobody's being held responsible and it caused me to land kind of square and the space of saying\nHey I think a huge part of the problem\nIs this position of district attorney and when you have a district attorney in a city or county\nWho doesn't really see justice the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible and um after all my life in to try to elect progressive reform minded\nCompassionate district attorneys all over the country\nBecause you know anything about how district attorneys work how they get into their positions any of that\nNo I I really didn't and I don't think\nMost Americans fully understand what the position of district attorney is what responsibilities they have and just how much influence and power\nAnd are and how much leeway they have in what cases they pursue how they pursue them what cases they drop\nAnd um it was really in twenty four team that I first came face to face with that reality in in four different cases with the case of Eric Garner the case of John Crawford the case of Mike Brown and then the case of Tamir Rice and Cleveland\nWhen I came to understand and it and it it took me almost three years to really understand this\nIs that the entire world can be incredibly frustrated and deeply agitated about\nA single case of injustice and we could have the top trending topic in the world we could be on the front cover of every newspaper\nBut if the local district attorney doesn't feel the same way justice can be nearly impossible\nSo let's go to the numbers for a minute Sean at that how ... how they get into their possessions [noise] how many district attorneys are there in this country and are they\nAll elected yeah yeah so\nThe plea agitated about a single case of injustice and we could have the top trending topic in the world we could be on the front cover of every newspaper but if the local district attorney doesn't feel the same way justice can be nearly impossible\nSo let's go to the numbers for a minute Sean at that how ... how they get into their possessions [noise] how many district attorneys are there in this country and are they all elected\nYeah yeah so there are right now there and write about twenty five hundred district attorneys all over the country and while the policies governing them vary from city to city county to county state to state effectively your local district attorney\nNormally functions in a city wide or county why capacity and with the exception of a few states where the governor gets to appoint those district attorneys\nThey are elected locally and they normally are elected even in places that are highly engaged like like New York city they're normally elected\nBy just three or four percent of local people who show up to vote and so the overwhelming majority of district attorneys literally are elected wants and often run on opposed sometimes not just for a few terms but for decades in\nSome states they are non partisan positions are in others they run as Democrats or Republicans\nAnd uh when I say that out loud most people around the country and around the world rather gas\nBecause the the their version of district attorneys around the country are appointed nonpartisan positions so the idea that the person who's overseeing their local justice system is an elected partisan shocks people\nUm I think some of the challenge comes in here they are Ninety five percent white those twenty five hundred people\nThey are nearly Ninety percent male\nUh and they are overwhelmingly conservative I mean what we're saying is hey we can change the system's a little bit from the outside but that's not nearly as effective as what we can do inside of these positions and so we're trying to encourage people\nIs an elected partisan shocks people um I think some of the challenge comes in here they are Ninety five percent white those twenty five hundred people\nThey are nearly Ninety percent male\nUh and they are overwhelmingly conservative I mean what we're saying is hey\nWe can change the system's a little bit from the outside but that's not nearly as effective as what we can do inside of these positions and so we're trying to encourage people hey you need to consider running for district attorney\nWell let's talk about one of those places where you got involved in Dallas County Calif a little bit about the candidate that you back and what happened in that race\nEffectively what we saw in Dallas and in other cities and counties across the country\nIs the best civil rights leaders in those cities all they are telling people sometimes is go vote and go vote is not sophisticated enough is not complex enough to really change a very complex justice system and um\nWe saw a an amazing woman who stepped out to run a local judge named Elizabeth for ... and uh we were so excited to ah to backer and a lot of people are sometimes kind of adopt reform talking points\nBut she like deeply want it to reform the system she saw how broken it was up close and personal\nAnd uh we were running against a a a former Republican who became a Democrat\nAnd um we ran our hearts out and I thought I thought for sure that we were going to win that race and uh something wild happened we on election day actually won over cruise though by over Fifteen Percent\nBut because he did so well in early voting a we ended up losing by just five hundred boats I think we also think we made a mistake there\nThere is this sliver of America that is desperate for reform but for most people who are coming out the vote\nReform is not the main thing that's getting them out to vote its safety and you will struggle to win any race if your opponent convinces voters if you\nBut because he did so well in early voting or we ended up losing by just five hundred votes I think we also think we made a mistake there\nThere is this sliver of America that is desperate for reform but for most people who are coming out the vote\nReform is not the main thing that's getting them out the vote its safety and you will struggle to win\nAny race if your opponent convinces voters if you want to be safe vote for me and if you if you want some reforms that may or may not affect you you can vote for your opponent but just know if you vote for me you will be safe\nAnd it took us losing to see that\nWhen we run exclusively on reform and give the issue of safety over to our opponent\nWill probably going to lose every single time\nWe have to take a quick break more with Sean King in just a minute to stay with that [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nIf you are
