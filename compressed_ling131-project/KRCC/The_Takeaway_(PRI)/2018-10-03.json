earning two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire and told all the president receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire [noise]\nThat's according to a skating investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper the investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents it charted the financial history of the Trump family business and the extent to which Donald Trump profited off of the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump\nThe report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes\nIn total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found the trumps pay just five\nPercent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJenny Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johns and more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance our tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud and invasions were quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory\nUm despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five district distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm it pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut at the time to investigation they found that basically it was a shell company was the company on paper and they would mark up the costs of products as a way of transferring the money it's unpacked skiffs is that tax fraud\nBelieve that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true um this\nI Believe that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true I'm this as tax fraud\nAnd I'm One of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS\nAnd this company had no economic substance it was merely a way of funneling gifts I'm from the president's father to ah the president and his siblings\nOne of the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's\nNineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complex as he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\n[noise] it's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur um and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nUm so you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value was probably wrong\nUm but it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations done by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nUm I Would say that that does evaluations are highly likely to be wrong\nUm but whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I I think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year\nThe thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attack state is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's a it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans were coming up on you know wrapping in about a minute here but for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't\nYou know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seemed to be able to get around this\n[noise] I I think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay estate tax\nYes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay ... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the mountains\nAnd whether the violation of allies will fall and um you know the IRS has a whole set of penalties that did they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJamie Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more

the United states\nAfter about three years the statistics show about tough people a half the people coming out will return to custody\n[noise] what exactly then are we measuring when we analyzed recidivism in the United states\nYeah that is a great question in many ... I I think it's the key question in a lot of ways because overwhelmingly focused on recidivism but I think we know that part of it is a due to find new some fail health system for people who are in poor health a lot of ...\nBut I think we know that part of that is due to ... health system for people who are in\nPoor health a lot of people coming out or on parole and parolees dies is really is a violent bureaucracy\nAnd as he posted a rehabilitative process exactly it's really become very much a law enforcement function it's a ... a parole officers spend a lot of their time monitoring compliance with the conditions of a community release\nAnd are filing a drug test missing appointments or a can lend you back in prison\n[noise] you have a different way of looking at recidivism is it these distance [noise] yeah so\nCriminologists talk about recidivism offending again after the uh you've committed crime or after you've been released from prison they also talk about the assistance and assistance means permanently refraining from crime and\nAh and I think the focus on the ... shifts how we think about the response to the problem of crime are and how we should think about people who are returning home after incarceration\nAnd I think the objective when we focus on distance\nIs just socially integrate people back into communities try and find to help them find a place for them in their families in the labor market in the neighborhoods in which they leave\nThe problem of recidivism Texas perspective of society what ... might someone returning home from prison caused to the rest of us\nThe perspective on assistance asks how can we find a place in society for someone who is being separated from it by incarceration\nAnd I mean it sounds like a wonderful idea is it a realistic one can we really given all the things that we've just laid out with addiction mental health issues um money I'm short plays into recidivism as well is it realistic to suggest that we could\nEnd up at a place where the existence is that the ideal\nI think so I think the policy conversation the public conversation around criminal justice in the country is changing I think one of the main implications of this focus on the system\nConversation around criminal justice in the country is changing I think one of the main implications of this focus on assistance is a lot of the answers to the problem in free entry or for example\nAre not going to be found with criminal justice or thirties they're going to be found outside of the criminal justice system with departments of health and housing and education and are in the resources of communities\nUh I think there's an appetite for that conversation ... there's a growing understanding that this massive experiment in mass incarceration there's not been successful\nIt's been very very expensive and it's been very damaging a for most disadvantaged communities\nAt a policy level we've in the past we've talked about banned the box for example to help 'em remove one of the barriers that formerly incarcerated people have when trying to find work where are we today when it comes to policy\nA great question most of the focus right now interestingly I think is a on sentencing and trying to shrink the system rather than remedy the negative effects of the system so in in that sense I think with further along\nI still think we have facing numerous challenges with re entry six hundred thousand people are coming out of prison\nOr every year in a every year in this country and they're struggling with employment and housing and a ... and their health care [noise]\nUh I think we need more than than the box a ... bend the books I think was an appealing as a policy reform strategy because it didn't cost anything but the truth is\nUh we need to invest in people who've been invested in their whole lives\nBruce western is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and co director of the Columbia University justice lab Ruth thank you so much for joining us ...
