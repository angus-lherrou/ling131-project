Gita in West Virginia\nWho was one of the first law makers to stand up on behalf of teachers in a state I've talked to teachers who are\nDeeply familiar with state policy now and they never were politically active before certainly people I've spoken to said that they've seen a huge increase in the number of teachers who have run and not only that but lawmakers that stood against teachers are crossed teacher unions\nIncreasing the number of teachers who have run and not only that but lawmakers that stood against teachers are crossed teacher unions seem to be getting punished in Oklahoma for example\nSomething like a half dozen state lawmakers who were incumbents were ousted in the primaries that same happened in West Virginia so you're seeing a lot of states teachers are are really flexing their muscles and a lot of different ways\nAre you noticing that voters have different perceptions of teachers and their expectations for what teachers should get paid and how they should be treated than voters have been seeing teachers in previous times\nYeah I think two things I've talked to grassroots organizations in Arizona and in Oklahoma who are sort of creating these pro education slates and so\nIt's not really about whether the candidate as a Republican or Democrat it's about uh where do they stand on raising funding for schools in Arizona something like forty percent of voters said that education was one of their top if not the top issue for them\nThe same thing in Colorado it's a huge issue\nI'm In Kansas to sort of indirectly the election has become sort of a referendum on whether Governor Brown backs tax cuts were a successor disaster\nSo I think there is I don't know if it's a changing perception of teachers but everybody has a visceral connection to education and I think the plight of educators it's getting a lot more attention now I'm rightfully so because in a lot of places they're facing some pretty severe challenges [noise]\nSo do you think we're in a new phase then of activism around the issue of education and teachers that were going to see beyond the ... election\nI Believe so even before the teachers' strikes or even as they were starting Republican governors started to recognize that that they needed to burnish their credentials on education and they started\nCampaigning on how well they were funding education it's no longer necessarily about tax cuts and responsible spending governor Doug juicy has campaigned on being the education governor so Scott Walker Scott Walker who famously gutted the power of a public sector unions and also cut school funding\nHas been advertising the fact that he put a lot more money into schools during his tenure\nAnd Scott Walker of course running against the state superintendent of schools and eyes\nThat he put a lot more money into schools during his tenure and Scott Walker of course running against the state superintendent of schools and I assume then that education is playing a very significant role in the Wisconsin governor's race yes it's playing a huge draw\n'em and I believe it's it may be one thing that is making that democratic candidate competitive is the fact that he is the superintendent of education so I think this was going to happen anyhow but I think there is this\nA recognition that schools are really important to people and that they don't want to see them in destitute condition Mariah thank you for joining us yes thank you ... is a national education reporter for the Washington Post [noise]\n\n\nMy name is more dangerous new representative elect for district Seventy four house of representatives in Oklahoma\nAfter the teachers' strike in Oklahoma in April over one hundred educators are now running for office there in this year's election marks and Karen is one of them and Karen has been a teacher in the state for over Thirty years but he like many teachers around the country got fed up with the education system in his state\nWe're having a difficult time here in Oklahoma because of our low teacher pay we had many many of our upper level courses the teachers who taught upper level courses decided to leave Oklahoma and go to other states for higher pay and as a biology teacher I watched people in my hallway a pack up and leave\nA people who were outstanding teachers and math and science just leave but I have kids that were in our our school system and and I it just basically just broke my heart to the point where I felt like hey I Need to get involved try to do something and see if we can rectify the situation\nWe

or Grateful Dead heads Haiti Rogers is a White House correspondent for the New York times\nEstimates she's been to about Fifteen to twenty Trump rallies in the past year\nShe estimates she's been to about Fifteen to twenty Trump rallies in the past year I spoke with her about how they've become a political statement for many Trump supporters it's important to note\nThat people you know like any other group they're not really a monolith so I can only speak anecdotally from the reporting I've done I've talked to a lot of people but you know one of the prevailing seems I find is that people come because they feel like they can come and talk\nAnd be in the open about their political beliefs or um I guess one example I was I was in Springfield, Missouri rally last month in the in the midst of Brett Kavanaugh and I talked to many women because I was just curious to get their take and take their temperature on it many women felt like they couldn't really talk about\nThe reasons why they wanted Kavanaugh confirmed the reasons why they thought Republicans we're actually moving too slowly because they are in their minds they're used to being jumped on an attack for voicing an opinion so and and ironically enough it's sort of like a safe space for a lot of these people\nYou can think that's wrong or think that's right based on your own political beliefs but they have gathered there because they have somebody on stage who is reflecting the frustration they feel\nA back to them and crowd and host sort of leave these events with another fix like to go forward with the energy to keep feeling like political outsiders\nThat's what I was gonna ask you is do you think that people who show up to the Israelis see themselves as political activists I think increasingly so I think um one one important\nComponent of these rallies which it's not talked about a lot because it's not really a sexy topic but\nThe campaign looks at these events as data mining expedition so they go when\nThey have a pretty um you know they have a digital sign up process so to get a ticket which they're free but you give over your\nYour cell phone information out of that campaign can learn a lot about you just just based on your sign up to attend the rally they want to build 'em you know sophisticated sort of kiosk checking systems in the future when you buy merchandise you turn over your driver's license which is common and a lot of sort of\nA political settings to turn over you know information like that\nBut I'm the campaign is using that to sort of spur future activism to keep in touch with these people to get them face to face with other people in their neighborhoods so they can leave these rallies and go home and door knock or make phone calls or get involved at their local ... headquarters um there's this whole\nUm can leave these rallies and go home and ... knock or make phone calls or get involved at their local GOP headquarters um there's this whole other\nBackbone to these rallies beyond the political theater where the campaign is working really hard to harness voter information spur activism and also raise a lot of money you see that the campaign has just raised another huge amount of funds I think it's a hundred million or something like that so\nThese events are are not just um an opportunity for the president to areas grievances um it's an opportunity for people to to go back home and get involved [noise] yeah because\nYou know we're we're looking at the activism on the other side right you see the women's marches and the other protests to Donald Trump and I was wondering if the people who attend these Trump rallies see themselves doing that same sort of political activism right if people are taking to the streets against the president I'm going to show up to a rally\nAs a way to show my political a viewpoint\nYeah people definitely voice that as a as a reason for why they support Donald Trump at all a lot of his supporters are older white people who have voted in elections before and they have told me you know dozens of them I guess a after attending a lot of these rallies\nThat they had not really been involved\nOr you know they they were quiet during the Obama years and then in Trump they found a candidate that where they felt like they could get out and get behind and I think that\nPeople very much see themselves as a part of his you know I don't want to use this word but the campaign uses his word as part of his army of of supporters and the campaign is very clear about wanting to build what they have called sort of an army of volunteers um there's a lot of that are wrapped up in in supporter identity I think\nAnd is your sense too that these voters are going to be active in the midterm campaigns I Know the president the other day I'm In a pie interviewed said well I don't know I hear from some of my supporters because I'm not on the ballot they may not show up\nWhat's your sense well I mean about a month and a half\nAgo I mean I think right before Kavanaugh sort of exploded you know people in the White House we're looking at data from a Republican pollsters that said exactly that that the president was going to have a turnout problem because he wasn't on the ... the ballot but what I Do think has happened is I think prospective voters had been mobilized by\nThe the Kavanaugh confirmation\nIt but what I Do think has happened is I think prospective voters had been mobilized by the the Kavanaugh's confirmation um there's like a there's a thought that the performance on behalf of the Democrats has almost been looked at as a political gift by\nRepublicans and the White House Republicans close to the president Republican pollsters\nWho said you know the president has not performed as well to mobilize moderate voters\nBut the Democrats have sort of given us this political gift of being able to call them a mob and that's really changed the tenor head of the midterms is really given the president and his advisors a sense that it's still there game\nHave you noticed as we get closer to the election that his his scripted sounds a little bit different than it did earlier in the year\nYeah he's done something that's kind of new in the past month or so which is personified the midterms by saying you're voting for me\nI'm I'm On the ballot and you think of me is on the ballot you're voting for me and don't let me down and if you pay attention to the local Republican candidates in these areas um they go on you know before\nThe president does or you know briefly during the president's appearance saying you know basically the same thing to that effect you know if we you know the president will suffer the president full will suffer if you don't come out and vote\nWith the campaign is banking on is that these people are going to come home and talk to their neighbors knock on doors start little volunteer groups and and spur in sort of animate activity right before the midterm\nKitty thank you for coming in and joining us thank you for having me Katie Rogers is a White House correspondent for the New York times\n\nThe take away it's
