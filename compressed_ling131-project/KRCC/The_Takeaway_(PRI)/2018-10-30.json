Nineteen eighties in Ethiopia perhaps\nIn places like Somalia into thousands eleven and these were really reminder that in in this day and age a very severe starvation is a reality in Yemen and the second factor which I think was probably the most compelling one is that this is very much a manmade found and this is not Iraq potentially in my mid ...\nThis is not a humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring shortage of food in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen and in many of the towns we visited the stores full of food the problem is that nobody are very few people can afford to buy it because of the country's economy has been devastated and the economic devastation is a direct\nProduct of the way that the war has been waged largely by Saudi\nSaudi led coalition some of the decision they haven't taken like withholding reads from a million civil servants in government controlled in controlled areas has had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as the plunge into the value of the Yemeni currency and\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before I'm the bunny they have is worth ... part of that and for people who are already living on the brink this is enough to push them over the edge\nAnd ah which I think we're talking to Declan Walsh of the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what is has it been so far it hasn't been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just seems devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over the summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port call today to that\nIs the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid that enters Yemen so a lot of the concern has focused on ensuring and I'm pressuring the competence that the fighting should not reached a port and stop the supplies reaching the country but increasingly now because of that\nNature of this bomb or the\nThreatened bombing and the problem with the collapse\nReaching the country but increasingly now because of the major a bomb or the\nBombing and the problem with the the economy a lot of stress

hurricane Ivan bowled over an oil rig belonging to tailor energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years every day the site has been viewing between three hundred to seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico\nTaylor Energy has cleaned up some of the math but they've also been suing the government to avoid a full clean up the site and if a spill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history Michael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us\nLike forever membership to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find well the\nAnd it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan and two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore is essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this spill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's a I think that's open to debate certainly and um ah the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do what they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane roll through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company and what the company says now the company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing tensions in greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the sediment away could make the leap given worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government\nAnd the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else down there below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill anywhere lake on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill into Wilton\n... tend to be ... as we all remember we were kind of transfixed by the images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming\nBP oil spill into Wilton ... tend to be ... as we all remember we were kind of transfixed by the images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom of the sea for ... it was coming out all at once you know over the period of grad\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out ... as you know oil birds on the seashore and the creator of environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious when it's staggered out and oil can be weathered\nBy waves in water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shore it's about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nTell us licks also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place again I Believe\nThat there are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says\nDifferently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life out there that can be affected by these persistent and chronic leaks\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they dealing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably in Louisiana for a program called tops the tea in tops which has financed free college tuition for many families over the years the this is a couple [noise]\nDidn't have kids of their own that invested a lot of money in um helping other people millions of dollars in Flint or be work is Taylor or his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators and she had hired\nLawyers or to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a of a fight that's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition a somewhat obscure a government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more down below the sea floor in terms of drilling a intervention well to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's just become a case about money and about how much more than you to spend or have available to spend\nTry to kill underground will so there's two fronts primarily it's just become is about money and about how much more than you to spend or have there will spend down below the surface\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us for ... [noise]\nWe reached out to a few scientists working around the Gulf about the Taylor oil spill bird and ask for a marine geologist at the University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have to clean up the site but instead they should fund scientific research to study the leaks\nThere about twenty oil blowouts in federal and state waters every year professor ... says scientists could use the Taylor oil spill to examine the impact of the oil how the sea floor community response to it\nHow it interacts with plankton and how oil is transported from the surface to the sea floor\nProfessor asked for also said some scientists have requested intentional releases of oil basically creating a spill in the Gulf to study these effects but the Taylor Site could be a good compromise\nWhat do you think about solutions like this join the conversation on our Facebook page or tweet us at the table\n\nTake weight comes from babble European made language learning program\nBabble teachers practical conversation and Italian Russian Swedish in other languages available me up store or online at B.
