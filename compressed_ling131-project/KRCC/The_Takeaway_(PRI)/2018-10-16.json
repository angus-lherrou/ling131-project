building codes and better enforcement was Hurricane Andrew\nA tremendous damage but in the aftermath we saw that a lot of the construction wasn't even being built to the uh the codes and the community

I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order like that there are other ways of ah how do you use the word that's a pretty harsh words on your show\nThen your thoughts on that at the the combined reporting here is a hundred and sixty nine billion dollars would be in revenue for twenty Seventeen for the three ... three companies that the president mentioned there\nYeah part of the problem when the president's argument is that he ... it starts with a number that's not actually based in reality it's going to use his term it's fake news this hundred and ten billion dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nIt's realistically never a number of that's going to materialize last year we saw less than ten billion dollars to Saudi Arabia so I have no real idea where were the other hundred plus billion dollars in arms sales are supposed to come from\nThe other problem with the idea is that arm sales are not a great jobs creator\nA lot of these firms that he's mentioning you know your Lockheed Martin's in your radio and\nAt the same time their their revenues I've been going up they've actually been cutting jobs here in the U. S. and some of these jobs have been going overseas to places like Saudi Arabia\nSo the ... the net economic impact to the U.S I think is negligible a bass so the idea of saying that if we cut off these arms sales it'll cripple the U.S economy\nI think at the very least that's hyperbolic\nSo Ben how about President Trump and the Trump Organization what\nA great jobs creator a lot of these firms that he's mentioning you know you're a Lockheed Martin's and your AC on at the same time their their revenues have been going up they've actually been cutting jobs here in the U. S. and some of these jobs have been going overseas to places like Saudi Arabia\nSo the ... the net economic impact to the U.S I think is negligible at bass so the idea of saying that if we cut off these arms sales it'll crippled the U.S economy I think at the very least that's hyperbolic\nSo Ben how about President Trump and the Trump Organization what personal economic stake do they have in Saudi Arabia\nThey in the men's personal steaks and Saudi Arabia and in fact uh it goes back decades between Trump and Saudi Arabia he's been doing business there for at least two decades that we know of\nUm he he's famously said things like well he he loves the Saudis they by twenty thirty forty million dollar condos and some of his hotels\nUm during the campaign alone he started a new businesses and Saudi Arabia related to hotel ventures there I'm In a menu that was just during the course of his um less than two year campaign\nSo you fast forward to when Trump takes office and he starts this great the Saudi started this great lobbying NPR enterprise I'm In a capitalize on a lot of that and ... they know Trump has not fully divested from his businesses and they know they can use that as leverage against him\nWhat would sanctions or could sanctions look like that would actually have an impact from a business standpoint\nI think there's a lot of options for sanctions um in in in I I think it's important for folks to realize that it's the U. S. that has the advantage here not the Saudis the Saudis rely much more on us then we rely on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI'm In uh as I mentioned previously they're trying to diversify their economy right now I'm In in this conference that that has been reported in the news the so called Davos in the desert concert a hum conference that's plan for a couple of weeks from now\nI'm a lot of American businesses I've already pulled out from that um in other foreign businesses to Richard Branson pulled out from it for for example\nUm and so even independent of what Congress does with sanctions I think you're already seeing plenty of blowback from the business community in I think that's only going to continue if the Saudis continue this very misleading storyline that they've been on\nAnd very briefly I Do you see this having an impact on the markets and\nI I mean I Would say at the end of the day then the Saudi markets for sure\nFor instance plan for a couple of weeks from now I'm a lot of American businesses I've already pulled out from that um in other foreign businesses to Richard Branson pulled out from it for for example\nUm and so even ... independent of what Congress does with sanctions I think you're already seeing plenty of blowback from the business community in I think that's only going to continue if the Saudis continue this very misleading storyline that they've been on\nAnd very briefly I Do you see this having an impact on the market's been\nOn I mean I Would say at the end of the day the then the Saudi markets for sure we've already seen some pretty dramatic impacts on uh on on on on the Saudi economy\nBut in terms of the U.S economy again we we just do rely that much on Saudi Arabia um economically for business ventures yet\nI'm certainly in the arms manufacturing industry or Saudi Arabia of the number one buyer of US military equipment in in arms sales but I think there's plenty of you know non economic reasons to question though is to begin with\nUh the war in Yemen has been declared the largest humanitarian crisis in the world in us bombs have been found to have killed civilians in that conflict\nSo to stop those bombs from blowing of Saudi Arabia could protect the lives of civilians and Yemen\nSpend Freeman is the director of the foreign influence transparency initiative at the center for international policy Ben thanks for joining us thank you very much for having me [noise]\n\nSupport for the takeaway comes from ...

are the members of this group coming from who are becoming members of the Proud Boys\nWill typically you know white males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty a that through their recruiting and it's good it's right wing males and you know I mean geographically most of them are coming from the suburbs and serves [noise] um but uh [noise] uh is pretty widespread\n[noise] Tanya I Want to bring you in here um let's talk about the history a little bit about the history of where the Proud Boys fit into our history with hate groups I was thinking back to when I was growing up in New York City and there were quote unquote skinheads and you saw them every now and then but are the Proud Boys unique [noise] I think they're\nA part of our shifting culture ... and ... what I mean by that is that\nTo say white supremacy in our most recent past was to a\nTrigger notion of white pride and all kinds of hatred against even the idea of racial integration [noise]\nOur move over time for it has been too as a nation embrace a sense of all we're more than just white and we can take pride in being more than just white [noise]\nSo what is so fascinating and I have to say disturbing um about the Proud Boys and some of these other youth culture a pro white organizations is that they're actually attracting men of color and men who identify as mixed race as well\nAnd part of that\nI find so disturbing is that it enables the organizations to say see we're not racist were just pro white as a culture and anybody wants to join that its welcome to join us including these men of color who are sort of also very much in amateur the idea of white and it says a status [noise] uh\nThe Proud Boys and some of these other youth culture a pro white organizations is that they're actually attracting

and anybody wants to join that its welcome to join us including these men of color who are sort of also\nVery much in amateur the idea of white and it says a status or and also some key a binary here is that anti blackness is a key feature of their platform so let's talk I was going to ask you what the driving force it particularly for men of color who want to engage in this is it racism is it ... is it both [laughter]\nIt is both I mean talk about a powered medic intersection oh example that is the conflation together of both ... anti gender bias and race bias\nOr either the the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say for a toxic white masculinity a and men of color are no exception to sort of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up there and being part of a the idea of a\n... call it western or you know supremacy western culture on and the western civilization that they say oh white men were part of creating\n[laughter] I I think that that is something uh that\nA marketable package of ideas that's very easy to sell unfortunately is it becoming more is it becoming easier to sell in this current climate and David I Want to ask you that will will when we come back from a break I'm Tanya\nIs most definitely easy to sell because it combines both a quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that it talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color um who are not by definition white kid engage with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate this idea of white and it says culture from racism and any anti black and it says also reduce the idea of oh it's not about blackness it's about bad black culture\n[noise] David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this new\nAs being a culture that is worth uplifting\nAs if you could take away from this ah racism\n[noise] I'm just curious how it is that people have color um who are not by definition white kid engage with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate this idea of waiting is as culture from racism and any anti black and I says also reduce the idea of oh it's not about black they say it's about\nBad black culture David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise]\nWell in some ways it's actually very old I mean you know started during this when I was covering Miriam nations in Idaho in late seventies early eighties and date to claim that they were only for white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of Ford's premises groups is that you know the claim
