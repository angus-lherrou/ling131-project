core of Donald Trump support or do county was unambiguously\nFrom ... loyalty Chinese in Trump's mid west they all appear to me retaliating against industries affected by Trump country working class white\nBut with all the focus on white rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump another important group of constituents is usually ignored\nThere are black people living outside of cities living mostly in the south and living in red states rights of the black belt overlaps with Trump country and those are the folks that are really going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia and part of what's called the black belt\nThe black belt is that what we know is the deep south which you know historically is where slavery thrived or where you know the wealth of the plantation system was created and obviously when slavery went away these became some of the most impoverished\nAreas in the country but the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans was was waged\nAnd so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore Cleveland or New York you know they were from the deep south and they expanded that franchise for all\nYou know this is also the place where\nIssues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks\nAnd how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have health care challenge\nThis is also the place where issues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks\nAnd how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell to obesity but they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nSay in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWell George it was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very a high profile gubernatorial contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams and Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign\nIn South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters live\nAnd the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color\nAnd so unlike other contest local contests for example that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest these are the voters that could really be key to to those kinds of victories and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that have been forgotten\nBy Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have\nA large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that well one thing that's important to think about for these folks is because\nHe has done go into a lot of these places that have been forgotten you know by Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that well one thing that's important\nTo think about for these folks is because they felt like they they they were electing people who were forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care\nThat they need and so they felt like at least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now\nFolks who look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several these counties that I went to you have incumbents who you know been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how is that possible well these people have gone unchallenged\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change if folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference\nRight and and what's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters\nFeel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight did rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something that wasn't even a concern for them\nNo I think it definitely is a concern\nBecause you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it and a lot of the nodded their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in city\nA concern for them no I think it definitely is a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it meant a lot of the nodded their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people\nThere's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distanced from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always occur to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas in and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalitions to be formed between the more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just is it too early to tell right now\nWell you know I think it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much I mean not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation and people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do\nKnow each other you know I I think of a recent campaign stop this they'd be able to identify plains Georgia which is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter has endorsed her they're talking about rural healthcare that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters\nAnd black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk about\nThey do have shared interests I I think does present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk\n'em so it's sort of a limited um a limited way in which courts have found them unconstitutional but that's sort of the wave that we're seeing now in California and Michigan and actually in Fort

Am\nHave\nThe races are on these up for grabs in every state keeping up with the mid term elections can feel like running a marathon\nWas about eating out there every day on the line from here\nStaying on top of all the election news can be a challenge and all things considered helps you keep pace you're the bigger picture every afternoon on all things considered from NPR News the news at three thirty Ninety One point five or so you see\nThis is the takeaway I'm tending to Vegas\nWhen a woman at the victim of domestic violence finding a way out is not easy\nFor immigrant women especially those who are undocumented things can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience domestic violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear deportation if they contact authorities\nOver the last several decades the secretive network of like the nuts has sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who had actually opened their homes at shelters for abused in\nThe press there is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety companionship and even medical and legal advice\nPresser says there are about one hundred and fifty other Latino women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the women she followed in her reporting so I follow them an imbalance\nThe secretive network of Latinos have sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who essentially open their homes as shelters for abused women\nDizzy press there is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety companionship and even medical and legal advice\n... says there are about one hundred and fifty other let the women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the woman she followed in her reporting so I feel a woman named ... and she's opening her home in one of the women who who she's working\nWith as a woman who I call Sylvia um she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while she was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nThis going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino house and stayed for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her abusive partner in this country when you're an immigrant women that can be even more difficult\nWhat is a new visa and how does it play into this conversation we're having\nStep back a little so the violence against women act was first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included a piece of legislation that\nProvided a path to permanent residency for abuse immigrant women who spouses were\nTheir abusers and who are also us at a center permanent residents so really small fraction immigrant women in two thousand that but the reauthorization of the violence against women act that was expanded in the movies that was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who were willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that crime that was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years have seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government was granting visas to women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today evil eight nine years for a visa\nThere isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person that clock so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nI'm In the same timeframe you've seen the number of a Jew Decatur has dropped from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally why is there such a delay and is that\n... prosecution of that crowd and it was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years have seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty fourteen the government with granting visas to women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today you will wait nine years for a visa\nThere isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person backlog so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nI'm In the same timeframe you've seen the number of a Jew Decatur has dropped from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally why is\nThere such a delay and is that delay what spring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nIt's hard to understand why there's such a delaying why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition of educators to help speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people to of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that survivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right so\nThat means that for nine years they don't have the protection of award private so they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the you because it was designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these women more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern under the Obama administration if so what's the difference\nToday I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that the concern is much much higher today than it was under Obama's administration the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who were\nComing to the safe house is essentially under the Obama administration\nDidn't feel as if it was as risky to come forward to the police say felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting with fat women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too can be separated\nWhen these women come to volunteer or do they ended up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen yes\nThe police say felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clearer and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was that women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too could be separated\nWhen these women come to volunteer or do they ended up staying just temporarily do they ended up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen\nYeah so ... estimates that about half of the women who have stayed with her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult police\nAnd a half of last some stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino feeling is it's up to them and she'll do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who were opening their homes who found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as the year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a shelter which is extremely hard to do you often have sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these women feel like the least they can do is kind of extend that stay\nWhy does the network need to be a secret\nSome of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose partners are\nAbusing them because they feel as if there's a possibility that if you there will then come after them some of them had kids they're living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect our communities\nAnd in part it's because the survivors themselves want to disappear they feel as if if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city did their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life\nAnd so they would prefer if their location was secret until the women who are opening their homes respect and honor that\nIs there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we're talking about Latinos in particular are there any uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence there's so much work that needs to be done at the ground level just to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know about what's going on in\nTheir home or what's going on in the workplace and we can't be failing to see that\nStart a new life and so they would prefer if their location was secret and for the women who are opening their homes respect and honor that is there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we are talking
