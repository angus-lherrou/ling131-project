[noise]\nThe Houston Astros are vying for a chance to win back to back World Series titles [noise]\nPitcher Roberta tuna may have lost the masters fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as plates on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy and while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays\nThan the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area Whitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public\nRight now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it [noise]\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case than a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nI think they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended a and eventually just about a over a month ago\nThe criminal case with wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a you know restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the details are just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way\nTalk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is that it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy\nLead to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations on suspension to this point no sooner was a the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so uh they're having players offended before and after roads you know he was not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um\nBut MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and that they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account um an overall the process it a little bit\nA kind of like have seen this case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy oh so you know what Seventy five games out of Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what emily's investigation consists of and um so it's a little tough and it does make it\nIt does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you were saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended out of the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players offended for\nSteroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigation go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think of a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon actually makes the team's stronger\nWhat do you make of that yeah I think it's a\nThe way I've seen it the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated\nYeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen it the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago\nAnd it did when the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it widow sooner um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that's what we're doing um you know he ... he throat good pitches he's gonna win could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of we now that we've created for sooner we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar and down in\nUm so again he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we traded for domestic abuse are\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that it feels like they're trying to have it both ways it it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... you know and AJ Hinch GM and manager of the team have kind of been like\n... he's a he's a great player he can put that past behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to local women's shelter in Houston, Texas area and um [noise]\nPartnership with the Texas council and family

T alliance that I think is um an allied a very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration [noise]\nUm I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and the political map of the middle east by pursuing a series of very aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian\nUh allies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab Spring\nI think we will to think that you know millions of people many of them young I'm with aspirations for a better future are simply going to accept to live under different forms of despotism forever I think is wishful thinking I think in many ways that really is the um the ... and bargain at many people in the west\nHave calculated on that these authoritarian regimes can simply keep things under control assuming that people will be too tired or two I'm disillusioned to resist and revolt of course with revolutions in revolts we never can predict window happened but almost certain\nUh another ... to some forum is inevitable\nWell and I will also you know the Arab Spring was in twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different a moment um at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering um what about that long standing relationship and support to the United states and Saudi Arabia have had\nA this isn't a Trump phenomenon solely this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time do you think that uh that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected by what we're seeing right now in the ground [noise]\nWell I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um to suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S\nI think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um to suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U.S relationship to the region goes back to World War two where the United states effectively I'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em\nOr autocrats and authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about what ...\nThe United states in specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of this coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nWhat could potentially be could show these um last moments um and then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it's simply going to um um perpetuate a very um [noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh that is responsible for a lot of the regional instability so I think the danger here that it's simply going to\nDeepen the instability in the region it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington D. C.\nIs willing to go to bat apologize deflect criticism from the policies of authoritarian regimes so is going to have a lot of destabilizing consequences we've invested heavily in these regimes we've had invested heavily in this particular crown prince hoping that he would be our savior\nAnd all of the warnings that people were issuing with respect to this policy with respect to the this particular crown prince no one took a seriously and this is not just stay Republican Trump problem this goes across the political spectrum\nAnd as I stayed at a moment ago as deep historical roots this is the consequences of investing in authoritarianism and political tyranny and ignoring human rights and basic um questions of of of democracy and good governance\nAnd we also know that the Washington Post published a final opinion piece from ... last night um which they had received right before his death or disappearance and in it he writes about the need for free expression in the ...\nUm which they had received right before his death or disappearance\nAnd in it he writes about the need for free expression in the Arab world can you tell us what the role of the press and the media is in Saudi Arabia and how that impacts what people bear understand about what's happening in the rest of the region\nThe role of the press and the media in Saudi Arabia is to effectively repeat the propaganda of the Saudi royal family I mean there is no independent press there is no free media that's one of the reasons why\n... had to leave and moved to the United states um and so the roles of media in Saudi Arabia is not that different from the role of the media and any authoritarian regime in Saudi Arabia I think it's much worse because the the the nature of that level of the repression\nParticularly under this crown prince has moved at a much more ugly and repressive direction you know this vital op ed that um that your mom has written is worth pondering it's worse worth thinking about but it's\nIt's important that we think about this this concept and this idea of the free press\nIn relationship to U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing a free press in Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing human rights we've been coddling dictators in death spots from the time that the United states emerged on the scene in Nineteen forty five\nIt's been a consistent policy of downplaying these basic values that we often espouse as being foundational to our own country at our own national identity but\nWe rarely apply them to our foreign policy particularly in the middle east and I think we have to we have to figure out a way out of this um this is broken pattern of of policies that are I think not in the long term interests of the United states and they're certainly not in the long term interests of the people in the middle east\nNot our hush me is the director of the center for Middle East studies at the University of Denver professor ... thank you\nThanks for the opportunity [noise]\nSupport for the takeaway comes from ... language that teaches real life conversations in a new language is Spanish French or German Mabel ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available and the ... more on line at battle me a B.
