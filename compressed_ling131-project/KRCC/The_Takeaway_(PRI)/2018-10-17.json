treatment of justice Brett Kavanaugh and he said quote here we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent\nMeanwhile secretary of state Mike Pompeo visited Saudi Arabia and met with the crown prince in a statement ... said the Saudi leaders would investigate the matter and that they continue to deny any involvement in ... his disappearance\nBut the incident has highlighted international concern over the Saudis regime on human rights abuses there have been reports of an increase of women and other activists being arrested entertained\nThis week we're spending some time trying to better understand the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia yesterday we looked at the economic ties between the two countries and today we turn to their record on human rights\nFederally within is the executive director of the middle east and North Africa division with human rights watch and she joins me now in Studio Hi Sarah high\nSo let's talk a little bit about crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon since he came to power in twenty Seventeen what's his record been so far on human rights well\nHis record has been quite bad actually probably far worse than his predecessors uh exercising power\nIn Saudi Arabia because he has not only are arrested and jailed activists\nOr who have been the traditional are targets of Saudi repression but he's gone far far wider in an effort to consolidate old power in the country so going after the business establishment going after other royals are who may have independent voices independent bases of support\nAs well as the religious establishment a basically the pillars of the Saudi royal family support\nAnd who don't understand why their country is so behind the times in these basic things that is extremely embarrassing when people talk about Saudi Arabia the number one example they would always give is that while women can't drive there so it's taken that talking point away at what has turned out to be very minimal cost\nFor decades or the Saudi government's defense for continuing to create this ban on women driving was that the public would revolt against the government if they changed it he has

out to be very minimal cost\nFor decades or the Saudi government's defense for continuing to create this ban on women driving was that the public would revolt against the government if they changed it he\nHas called the bluff of all of those threats as to why Saudi can't make changes and so certainly now we want to see other changes like lifting the ban on a women's right to marry women can't get

the perils faced by journalist all around the world especially women\nThere was Kim Wall aged thirty a freelance journalist murdered while reporting aboard a submarine off the coast of Denmark and then dismembered\nDaphne Koran I got leads young age fifty three investigative reporter and anti corruption blogger in Malta murdered outside her home by a car bomb\nVictoria Mari nova age thirty investigative television journalist in Bulgaria raped and murdered by blows to the head and suffocation\nEach of these murders to place over the last\nTwo years in Europe away from major conflict zones these journalists were not caught in crossfire they were targeted losing their lives at least in part for being journalist or for being women in high profile jobs\nTwenty Eighteen is on track to be more deadly year than last year so far according to the committee to protect journalists sixty two journalists have been killed men make up the majority of that number but some say that doesn't reflect the atmosphere of danger for many women in this line of work\nIt used to be the case in hostile environment that if you wore the woods press on your vast that that would be some kind of protection it would force protection now it seems that having that kind of spot on your chest actually makes you a target\nThat's Judy Ginsburg she's the chief executive officer of index on censorship of freedom of expression nonprofit I asked her about Kim Wall Daphne car when I got ... and Victoria ... and the work that they were doing\nSo in the case of basic toy yeah I'm an Daphne that both investigative journalist we don't know yet whether Victoria was targeted specifically for him best to get to ... to corruption\nWe know that stuff was the target of repeated threat for her work investigating corruption at the highest levels of government and business and most to she was killed a year ago yesterday\nAnd she was targeted in a number of ways including\nVictoria ... and the work that they were doing\nSo in the case of basic tore a um an Daphne that both investigative journalist we don't know yet whether Victoria was targeted specifically for him best to get to work investigating into corruption we know that ... was the target of repeated\nThreat for her work investigating corruption at the highest levels of government and business and most to she was killed a year ago yesterday\nAnd she was targeted in a number of ways including through legal threats and others are repeated criticism of her work in the case of cam she was mud walls are doing a report into a submarine and the inventor of the submarine and killed while on board dot submarine\nWhat are some of the unique challenges I'm and dangers that women journalists space do we understand why we're seeing journalists female journalists being targeted in general\nSo what I Would say that it's not ... female unless a targeted disproportionately because that done a list\nI think what we've got to look out here is the way in which women are targeted disproportionately with threats of abuse or threats of rape harassment dog sing and the like\nAcross the board not just in general is and now that the thing about journalism is that women in journalism tend to be relatively well known in the high profile journalist I Am a done this myself\nWe needs to be in the public high we need to be known to people say that they feel that they can approach us with\nStories out bylines are on newspapers out pictures unknowns people if with a broad causes on television so people are aware of who those women on whether they target them because that journalist so because the women it's less clear I think what is clear is that people are increasingly feeling able to\nHave a go at John List in ... because of the environment that's being created by politicians and others and criticizing done this publicly\nAnd that the public in general and largely men feel that they are able in particular to Target Women with\nReally know the threats and we'll see set and he's saying that on the rise tell us a little bit about the role here of social media in particular show so obviously in the past it was more challenging to ... John as to how to write a letter to or even ...\nAble to have a go at journalists and ... because of the environment that's being created by politicians and others and criticizing John this publicly and that the public in general are largely men feel they'll able in particular to Target Women with\nReally know the threats and we'll see set and he's saying that on the rise\nTell us a little bit about the role here of social media in particular show so obviously in the past it was more challenging to ... John issue how to write a letter or even cool uh done this now it's much easier to target people in general\nAll of us put out probably falls off an out there in the public so it's easier for people to get in touch with us they need to know\nOur phone number they need to know the address a home addresses the address of the newspaper they can contact us almost directly what that's done on the one hand I think the Internet has been a great thing for journalism and democracy in general it's enabled those who didn't have a voice previously to voice their opinions that concerns\nThat criticism but also what it's allowed people to do with feel that they can\nPublicly boom rate criticized and in some cases abuse and harass people with whom they disagree I think it's less clear how fall these abusive messages on line translates into any real intention to commit violence we heard about the three women that you mentioned\nBut it's unclear how fall the people who are sitting in the homes feeling that it's fine to abuse women online actually have any intention of carrying that out nevertheless it doesn't stop at having an impact it easy I think for people to say\nOh just suck it up pick nor it but that knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of messages\nThreatening you and your family is and and I think that's something that we don't often talk about it's not just that some of these threats real or not\nUm two women are not just saying I wasn't going to attack you I Wish you would be raped and so on it's all said that often people's families a threat to and and that gives any Dave Mandel female I think great pool is about how far they want to carry on you know what's interesting is\nThat the three cases we're talking about here all happened in Europe and I'm Wondering if that tells us anything about what the environment is like for journalists there\nI think it does I think one of the things that we have noticed most in our monitoring\nWomen are not just about saying I wouldn't get an attack Q. I Wish you would be raped and so on it's all said that often people's families of threatened and doc is anybody metal female I think great pool is about how far they want to carry on you know what's interesting is that the three\nCases we're talking about here all happened in Europe and I'm Wondering if that tells us anything about what the environment is like for journalists there\nI think it does I think one of the things that we have new test most in our monitoring of media freedom in Europe in recent years that index on censorship is the way in which the environment has changed for journalists generally and I think in part that's because\nPoliticians those in power have enabled the environment we have the president of United States but not just the president of the United states a number of politicians throughout Europe who are openly voicing criticism of the media\nFor anything that they don't like enemies of the people fake news and that creates an environment I think in which the profession is devalued and which in which people then failed that journalists are fair game\nJudy Ginsberg of index on censorship of freedom of expression nonprofit has joined us talking about the dangers of journalists in particular women Jodie thanks for being on the take away was my pleasure [noise]\nThe takeaway is supported by timeshare exit team founded on the belief that valid contracts must have a reasonable term exit options that timeshare exit team dot com\nBust a real good insurance for voting to be going to hope customers consider options for multiple insurers to bury the billboard ... dot com or woman or a hundred percent [noise] no that's progress\nAnd babble Europe handmade language learning program battle teaches practical conversation and Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available and the app store or online at the a B B.

the early stages of recovery from hurricane Michael and in a few weeks voters will be taken to the poll for mid term elections\nAs Rick Scott term in the crucial rates for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum and facing off against GOP candidate Ron dissent is and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort\nFloridians will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of the three states along with Iowa in Kentucky that permanently takes away the vote the right to vote from

are just a couple of weeks away how it was a storm like Michael effect\nRights to one point five million felons Florida is one of the three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently takes away the vote the right to vote from the convicted felons excuse me and there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections that emerged during the primaries\nWill turn out again next month David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway\nThanks for having me so there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how is a storm like Michael affecting or it could affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWell um where Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really wiped out um a lot of the roads the uh infrastructure and so immediately we're seeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle\nUm be ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election days so that'll be interesting to watch uh they aren't the most populous counties\nBut that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset the table for the campaigns\nUm you know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nUh those issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused in the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some statewide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as\nGovernor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum\nOr had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm or Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to ship his campaign to remain involved without an official role the hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nSo do we do we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to sort of taste step aside to handle the hurricane or his campaign still going\nPretty well the the polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out\nTo take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm or Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to shift his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we do we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to step aside to handle the hurricane or his campaign still going pretty well\nThe the polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning\nThe really the first poll a taken to ... to potentially show hurricane of fact and it still had Gillum at plus one um I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on\nThe the media rotation during and after the store and more dissent is ah didn't have a invested role and the recovery and the preparations are so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks\nOr to see whether we'll see any other shift but um it's in a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point or I don't think we're going to see\nEither Andrew Gillum or ... or a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWhat late last month we sell a University of north for the poll that had a the ballot measure at Seventy one percent support\nIt had to get on the ballot or the the backers of amendment for uh pursued a petition drive that received nearly nine hundred thousand signatures which obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those\nSing the tours would also voted for the initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a valid question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're gonna see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the image speaks to do and the fact that I'm convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored\nWhich obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those seem to tourists would also both for\nThe initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a ballot question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're going to see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the amendments speaks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about you know to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for\nUm people who are convicted certain non violent offenses uh and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that the Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect the liberal majority\nWell right on the ah southern member court there are three of of four justices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc\nAnd have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in\nAnd given that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like\nThat seems likely to to energize a they're voting base is I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court might have actually a given Rhonda Santas a bump who is trailing\nI'm pretty consistently in the polls by a decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that\nAh that ah controversy energized\nFor the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with the Santa's over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and I'm In that might have given him a bump so probably better for the Santa's them for a gallon but certainly Planned Parenthood ah abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think\nBuy a decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that ah that a controversy energized for the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant a two sided with his aunt is over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and um and that might have given him a bomb so probably better for the Centers for Gillum but certainly Planned Parenthood\nA abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that you know a liberal voters are just going to throw up their shoulders and and think about other issues\nNever a dull moment in Florida David Smiley from the Miami
