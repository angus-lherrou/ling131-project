creativity can you tell us a little bit about that [noise]\nYeah I think that's right I mean you have your classic biographical spots which are the positive ones are candidates are walking through a

the mid term election\nAnd one of her biggest talking points\nFear of immigration\nWhat's happening right now as\nA large group of people they care of it [noise]\nShe's referring there to the caravan

today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America [noise]\nYour cameras and search for the five ten minutes or you're going to buy Middle Eastern\nYou're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowed in August we want to say [noise]\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron Nixon the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us and thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but\nClearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who within the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily um migrating and and speaking to a an asylum [noise]\nUm primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there are some people from my colleagues on the ground and understand that there are some people from Guatemala and maybe for a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh it looks largely like it's it's a\nIt's a crowd of people were group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who we're seeing that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWill it's inconceivable that there are not I'm\nA people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward our border\n... well let me let me just to to six on this I mean in in the last fiscal year\nOh well we are for him to more than more than a a more than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border or from countries that are referred to in the lexicon\nSuspected terrorists per day at our southern border or from countries that are referred to in the ... other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east what is he referring\nTo there to live in Mexico ... includes\nEverybody from Mexico and they know it's not a direct women are okay I Know I Know including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people uh you know seeking to come across the border um either get asylum or crossing the border illegally were uh people from Mexico\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen still far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that MS Thirteen is is a part of the group um [noise]\nYou know the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what their mess Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly you know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who is in my MS Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know um and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here on do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm elections\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped to president get get elected and this has been at one of one of ... if not the signature issue I'm for this uh administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place while a particularly now you see cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to the ... they're they are there are these people who are trying to to get into our country um so I think for them you know it's it's an issue\nThe they're they're they are there are these people who are trying to to get into our country\nUm so I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as um you know political or scientific posters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house of representatives you\nWe've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the caravan of the Venezuelan plot um the president had suggested that the caravan as being supported by Democrats and George Soros his name it's been tossed about run to you know can we confirm any of those\nClaims um [laughter] [noise]\nSo there is no evidence I'm a Democrat to George Soros or Venezuela\nUm have sponsors of this particular care man and woman or this is uh something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't uh ... make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami to New York from what I had written yeah right and they're walking right so take that into consideration

sixty minutes daylight saving time stole from us back in March\nAnd two days later Californians will have a chance to decide if they want to join Arizona and Hawaii and live in permanent daylight saving time meaning no more clock changing that's right and California daylight saving is on the ballot proposition seven and lots of you say right on either\nHe John from buffalo I have been railing against the time change for years so I have a sleep disorder we really throws my body clock off for weeks every time we do is this is Peter from\nNew York I absolutely would support and chew through junior clocks on his into war disrupting a young children to already fraught shall we say this is Sam from Portland, Oregon yeah them for the time change things\nThat seems silly to change our clocks course you're going to have a much larger changes and flight and then our ...\nDaniel event in as an editor and reporter for ... science in San Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today\nDanielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway thank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from a state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in\nSan jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents um it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke traffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep on throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for prop seven like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why a prop seven wants to be a at the white white folks are pushing props up\n[noise] yeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clocks steady year round\n[noise] yeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clocks steady or around also when we are using daylight saving time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because ah ends and public health benefit because people are exercising throughout eating at restaurants they're playing sports they're walking their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can you remind us\n[noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time out if it was in the late Seventeen hundreds he was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habits just leap\nA to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon and one morning he got woken up by this loud sound at six AM\nAnd realize oh the sun's up I could be could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries like was Germany the was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort\nAdopted daylight saving time to save energy and it did use to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars was brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight saving time schedule that we have now uh in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil prices can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight saving time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo\nBut it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold very dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that\nHelps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south or who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the share of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes [noise] you know on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so here for instance in California if this proposition passed\nAnd California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state but would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported it as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness\nEducation pathway for immigration prisoner farm ... even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take a vote no\nDidn't you know we've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with the decreased accidents and increased productivity\nDaniel venting as an editor and reporter for cake you will see science Daniel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n\n\nThat takes
