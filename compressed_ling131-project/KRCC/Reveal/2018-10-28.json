I mean I've been to the office many times now in person and also calls and\nSays they finally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago we meet in the hallway

even after the test [noise]\nYou know after something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays in ... babies be released\nI think there will be some information released\nThis is the kind

help secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I can talk to anybody when name without being authorized because we want to have a ... message\n\nAfter we part ways I'm left standing in a convention center hallway and what starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the ... with me or even their own top secret doctors several doctors told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nIn that silence doctors like Carmen ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the

none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShould just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe book it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told ender there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they're known to cut checks late

does\nThe fact that under mess quest that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work but
