A. B. E. and Atlanta Johnny Kauffman is W. A. B. east political reporter and he gets a started in southern Georgia\nIt's weeks before the mid term elections I mean a small town called Moultrie writing in the back seat of a Ford Focus that's moving slowly down the street it's getting dark and three women from a local chapter of the Democratic party are appearing at the house number's force\nIn next month's laugh or get past\nWay things are three [noise] so that's on their side [noise]\nOne of the women steps out and walks up to a house [noise]\nThe women are looking for likely Democrats using a list they got from the state party\nAs the sun goes down and it gets darker no one's answering the door it's getting close to eight o'clock Sarah clean decides to try one last house some of the TV inside is turned to jeopardy and someone's head is visible through the window [noise]\nNobody comes to the door with Clinton turns around and walks back toward the road\n... votes development they see [noise]\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nWhy there\nAre ya that evokes her\nShe's not\nState record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls Reverend ponder tells us he doesn't\nPonder register to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year official struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does his aunt know that she's been taken off the voting list\nAngela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside Moultrie\nHigh as famous ponder\nHi I'm Angela completely I'm a reporter with public radio driving\nA story about people whose and removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this but\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight year ever that Obama is running do you remember\nYou know to vote for him\nOr are there for it or anything\nSo then uh last July you were taken off the voter list I Would have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen and um but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nBeen from this you know\nDid you know there there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for governor\nAre always better than the two back at Reverend ponders office Angela gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter list and she had no idea\n... that's interesting\nBecause she was never notify\nOr anything she doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] well I think we need to get down to the bottom of it because if it happened to her to Rome and she she ...\nShe says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nBut almost getting people to read mine said that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that has a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use this privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\n\nAnalyze all the people\n\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor when it comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there is this illusion let people register all the way to election day\nAt least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a write in to privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree uh who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's at a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit I don't know how to distort the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know on October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike it if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters days about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be\nPolls both probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough you have to\nPolarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. V. E. and Angela ... poodle from a PM report [noise]\n\n\nWhen it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy target for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking\nNo I Would not counted as hacking now\nWhat was it then it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on repeal [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nHi I'm to members joined me for a journey to the sounds of jazz cover at all so seven to ten Ninety nine point five years [noise]\n\nNow you can tune in to Ninety One point five care cc without lifting a finger just ask your smart speakers like K.

R. ex disease is revealed an outlet up till now we've been talking about all the barriers to prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list but even if you get into the booth\nInto a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list [noise]\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on touch screen voting\nMachines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nAnd one of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia [noise]\nA lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hack in Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of elections there actually listening reveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nSo uh right now I'm In the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta\nHis specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and a Bible Logan booted up\nSays act you touched glitter and minutes deacon pressing the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that will chime at the beginning and use that as my ring time\nAnd this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cyber security tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact the aries had been criticized by technologists basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nLimited truly only by one imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even though Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan\nStudies de Ariz ... vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting prevention or inject basically now where a virus into any part of this tree the way it's set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree [noise]\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where Kim's people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adapting paper ballots over electronic wind for the mid term election\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nChaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of fat\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they demean as paranoia for research based finding of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards the terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nTo people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference\nThey say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg is ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by Duncan brought us the story\nMm [noise]\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp Savage to commission that'll look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms that used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country\nBut where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal from the center for investigative reporting in P.

R. ... this is revealed I'm allergic to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nThat many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people lose claims\nHave been totally the bar but one of the people who got those theories going with the Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically are pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nVisas the ACLU worst nightmare 'cause he knows the constitution says five to keep them from making confetti of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nHey hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has his big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen so called about\nA longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave lawn\nConservative circles how did that happen so Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who back to that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's a term he loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging elections\nBut the way we know that that is not true that is right out I could through a bunch of the little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against it is well it's a made a problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed ... book lists them or what was the looking person well you know come on makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate\nBut as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term managers are fed it\nWould be they are using\nThe term line as an actor and it's not asked why then you will thrill all these studies in statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach you know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford\nAnd then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach it grew to include more than half of the\nVoter registrations in the U. S. okay so how does this thing work so about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check ... ...\nThan half of the total voter registrations in the U.S\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in its cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different states", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "21"}
