dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAndy is still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably ah you know close to a hundred percent are able but the Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before we get started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf how many of them have bomb a\nViolent crime was one\nOf the ways Carter proposed giving farmers in equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nCampaign promise that's what we call those yeah there you go this was\nNot just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but\nWhat any of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire nevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon SUV is going up because the government\nAnd do you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would get as bad as God but every instinct I had said oh this is ... is going to work out so well\nWrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon to just going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would do it as bad as a God but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... is going to work out so well\nExactly so the thing that the government was concerned about is what's called commercial displacement\nAgain economist Andy ... and he says the government could not just release a flood of surplus cheese onto the market because it would crush she's producers\nYou can imagine the the cheese company that's in the business selling shoes is going to say what's the deal here you took away my customers is important to me\nThis leaves a couple of options you could destroy the surplus but that looks pretty bad\nOr you can try to get your surplus goods to people who are not going to buy it anyway and that you won't be flooding anyone's markets\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered milk we can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid but\nShe's just doesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese away through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kinda ruled on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which\nOne you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as a government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great changed give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surf\nA seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like\nBricks and this is what people will remember as a government

will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on it and\nHe's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the caves full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food banks and schools military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nOf government cheese and\nGovernment cheese starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator the girl government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nWe bought we would get like a blood cells in them with some some but\nMaybe government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with\nWant to change our government she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nWas ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to\nWhere Martha Stewart cook stuff with [noise]\n\n[laughter] government she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to ban but I'm not running down bell veto but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance Cary doing the dance strain but here is like government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nMama's boy\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well\nI think there's there's a two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which one is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or\nPolitically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] when I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's been be\nGovernment cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government\nAs you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you in budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] swimming that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that up to ... very very expensive she's indeed\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was to gently get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like\nHave people of America wouldn't you like to drink more male [laughter]\nWe took a a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but this is what it was a you know the gotten milk and the ... mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension so these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes\nThe the government has tended to stay away from buying cheese as a solution that is until last July\nHouse is coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available the Trump Administration\nEventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension for these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese of solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs for the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like\nSchools and food banks that would be fair that's probably not enough to start selling caves which again but there is a chance that the government to baby in the business of government [noise] to the cheesecake [noise]\nToday's episode was produced by Alexi for with God these big mountain hand

and I'm very negative very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the show yet total I'm sure they got that you know they they're gonna be nothing can give me down to me I think I'm going out of business every other day [noise]\nFrom NPR how I built a show of an innovator entrepreneur dealer\nYou know the shows yet total I'm sure they I think that you know they they're going to be nothing can give me down to me I think I'm going out of business every other day [noise]\nFrom NPR how I built a show about innovators entrepreneur dealer\nStories the movement\nBut not from the people I thought I was going to get a reaction from which were my contemporaries which was from the younger kids that were like the phone was ringing like where do you get that shoe and all that stuff so we knew that something was going on here so that's the track that we went on\n[noise] All right so you've got this pretty good business going and year one what are you thinking now you thinking okay I mean did you have ... at that point all ready to make this into something ...\nSo where I'm at is I started the business and you know just but I really don't have much money I'm just sort of working hand to mouth and a friend of mine who I grew up with went to work for this brokerage firm and they were raising money for small companies this is Donny\nPoor Danny ... yeah and uh you know we're going to raise you were going to get you\nRaise you six hundred grand and to and he said to you hey you need to expand your really talented I've known you my whole life you know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know hundred thousand it was like six hundred million to me\nAnd then he said well not only will I get your six hundred grand but I'm going to get your six million dollars when I take your problem and I laugh\nGet him you know because I probably had thirty thousand dollars in my to my ...\nAnd so of course you're like what thirty three thirty to something like that yeah and you're thinking we could raise me six hundred thousand bucks that's right so so so so Danny or help you go yeah and he helped me go public and his mom\nWas called strap no mine a very famous saying for anybody who's seen the wolf of Wall Street did\nWas pretty good movie actually my name\nIs Jordan Bell for the year I turned twenty six I'm forty

would ... get subsidized jacked up later sell all the shares make tons of money I Would lose their stress and so they basically were wanted\nTo do this with Steve Martin right\nThey want it to do it Steve magical perfect guy for them because because you don't have a company and there was small and they can do their thing with it you know it fit the profile\n\nFor those you know me ah\nMy name's Steve Martin and we know you are [noise]\nSo that scene and\nWith me talking in front of them it was very accurate we should explain the scene for people who haven't seen it you you go up in front of all these um these traders in the ...\nYear I started talking about my shoes thinking that they would really be interested really weren't I was just a piece of it was just a piece of paper and a piece of meat marry that they could sell\nYou really want to just to digress for [noise]\nBecause [noise] the people for this\nBudding entrepreneurs I'm not one of those entrepreneur is that that thought he was going to the super successful you know I was just trying to survive and I'm very negative and very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the show total I'm sure they
