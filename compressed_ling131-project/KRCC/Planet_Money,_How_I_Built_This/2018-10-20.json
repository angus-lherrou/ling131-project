worry a lot about fake news and more generally I'm really concerned about trust on\nThe Internet and then ... came to us and said uh before there was fake news before there was a possibility of like fake video and fake audio the world was dealing with a different fake problem\nYes fake online reviews people have been posting dishonest online fake reviews for years\nYeah and and this is becoming such a huge problem because like you know I go on line to buy a hover board and I don't know if this report has five stars because it is awesome and I'm going to cruise around town looking cool or if it's five stars because someone is making up those reviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire [noise]\n... is here with a glimmer of hope for us yeah\nAnd the dilemma

grocery store and I'll have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of water\nWhoa that's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds\nOne day Tommy was hanging out with a friend\nWhen he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid in case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those\nAnyways Tommy's friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he's after Tommy I\nAll right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into review meta okay and then I hit my report and events that report right and it's though\nComputing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flag about these iPhone cable reviews\nOkay so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave\nDays this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese reviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average maybe use their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with\nWords that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but first year we see it in three reviews\n[noise] um yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and use again ah I don't know what it means but seven people feel that way [laughter] well\nSeven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct for ... [laughter] yeah\nSo Tommy software random about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just it invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy ... only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they view say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I've flown cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills test\nWe of course reached out to Amazon and about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they sent us an extensive\nPills to stop we of course reached out to Amazon about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they sent us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admits that they do not have the city if you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even said with high confidence whether a review is fake according\nTo what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon or actually going to go out of their\nWay to fix this so it's complicated right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review if someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time\nWhere there was just too many fake Vivian sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up yeah fun Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to France France should we will go back to Iran for my friend [laughter] [laughter] well\nThere is a point where it's just that all of them and we have to go back to talking to her friends again or you have to call your mom shopping advice that yes would you pay your youth is among [noise]\n\n\nToday's show was produced by Nick fountain editor is Bryant or staff or supervising producer Alex gold mark who told me to tell you\nWe could use reduced to win money wise view the police don't get no real reviews I'm Kenny Malone and I'm healthy ... thanks for listening [noise]\n\nWas the best story ever all kind of real review Guy Raz\n[noise]\nThat was the best story ever all time is that a real review Guy Raz [noise] absolutely absolutely OK okay to tell us what's coming up next on how I built a [noise] well Kenny\nComing up we're going to meet an entrepreneur who like to run his restaurant chain and the little differently [noise]\nWe were making spinach quest saw we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to\nTo get rid of the water and somebody came up with ... which by a dozen close drivers they will but but the spinach and the clothes dryer that will decide to take the water was a great idea\nUntil one day we blew the top off the or the drier ended up with spinach and all three thousand square feet of the production [noise]\nFrom NPR how I built that\nShow that innovators entrepreneurs dealer stories and the movement\nGuy rise and they show how runner's build that little bakery called ...\nAnd then coming back to build an even bigger restaurant Jane\nStick around after the break it's how I built this from NPR [noise]\nYes [noise] you can have great music seven nights a week from seven to midnight and Ninety One point five K.
