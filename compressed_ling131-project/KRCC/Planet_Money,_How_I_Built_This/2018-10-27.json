[noise]\n... markets play money supervising producer Brian or is that what editor stories or if he were here\nThinking about moving to Seattle and all of a sudden I'm On this mountain in this life goes off for me and I think why isn't somebody made something of fruit that's in spices like something very\nJust pure and simple real food but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like don't junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nIt was like this surge of energy I God I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day in that time and all those little experiences that built tough I I just felt\nSo what'd you do did you like run home and and and and started like writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kind of model referral for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing\nDown ideas and then when we got back to Denver I thought how can I take ... nuts and spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay how\nDo I take cherry pie and make it just to get my quizzing are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it tastes like cherry pie or apple\nPie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining it's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your\nKitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like\nBeing like Dicky ball of a match and then when you would like take it out with your hands and like I went out with a rolling pin and then um\nI got to cut her and I would like to cut her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I mean you have any cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in a year while you are not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills\nOf your own I mean did you have any cash did you have to ask you parse help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought I'm going to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah so the\nWhole foods opened their first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up in the in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought\nI'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this people are gonna want want bodies\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy this and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again how are you just like sort of funding that's been like finding greens and stuff and and this was when using your own money\nAnd you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card\nAnd were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of grain information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated and somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and a little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month ago by where I couldn't get any\nThey would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow\nAnd then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and then I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when I actually launched so\nI Am trying to figure out how you uh maintained your your optimism and confident about all this 'cause I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nAnd I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and it was part of you I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you uncover think oh yeah that's Laura she's got this kind of weird ...\nProject a lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they ... they're they're already climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nI didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments where people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen projects in into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and [noise] [noise]\nIf you are looking for something to do in the Ninety One point five care cc listening area [noise] check out the community counseling\nCare C.
