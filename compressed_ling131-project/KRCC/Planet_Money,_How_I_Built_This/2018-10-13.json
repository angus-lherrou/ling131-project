the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not opposition uh and the fact that companies do compete on application did not create a better economy does not create or got

baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so\nHave a lot to watch anyway are actual final week is about baseball is also probably our most controversial tweak\nYes major league baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up\nThe game little things like limiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter\nAnd that's all fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up they would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nUh my name is David ... professor politics or New York university you like baseball I'm a fan a but not a rabid fan [noise]\nNot not one who's willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose\nUh no I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah like guy you want to catch up what must it on that guy that's not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a parole\nAnd baseball and works as follows a that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're a bad then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more\nChances Steve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the ketchup ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much\nShorter with these games are dead the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game a half an hour of the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nOkay and we analyzed a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the ketchup ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan\nHow much shorter with these games are ... the average game which now about three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game and a half an hour ago the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's\nAlso got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be them only Eighteen seconds at the end of a game\nOn my God how you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much\nAnd don't go to any baseball games anytime soon you might get\nThrown at

experiences\nBut it never quite died and in fact it grew it grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about starting killed cofounder Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he\nKnew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire is dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how many people did your dad's company employ several thousand I think at their peak they were at the twenty eight hundred wow these are true company\nTowns of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nIn the dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities did as well\nAnd what happened to your family\n[noise] ah well it was really a three three for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my ah sort\nOf childhood role model has died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a\nIt was a wake up here ... yeah I um my father a got a began drinking um [noise] and so I had

a dart at the wall figured out the value of the business or what have you value it at the time [laughter] well we\nThought we were going to value at at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries were selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a an independent grocer who had seven stores and um this\nWill give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night we were having dinner at the ... and the phone rings and a jak into Melissa nephew of the\nOwner of the demolition market basket and chain ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling if my competitor than not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time and Sam and say well ah to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we went out and\nGrew are heard even further and then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease a small refrigerator truck and started delivering actually to the market basket ... warehouse\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing\nNow about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and cases like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but\nYou were probably

they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days it's a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope and they had one store and Cambridge on prospect street and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket this is now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont who ... in the TPP would there what do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had\nOld ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine and um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to\nWould then take us in and we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the TPP with their ... you know they didn't need another\nYou know organic yogurt from some crazy people in New Hampshire [laughter] ... what you guys do so in July of eighty\nFour I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus on prospects in Cambridge and ask\nFor my yoga and that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol skin or the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles as last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's miles and then they're going to ask for an end run around the time you meet\nIn may he would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no compromise northeastern farming association conference in I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and or right after I finished my speech this\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg\nAnd her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want what they called F enough money first\nKind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course I needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter] I started raising and I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase since so she increased to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money for friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know\nSome Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful oh yeah\nYou know what happened in this farm house I I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAnd and but at this point of the half a million dollar business\nAnd I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tip toe over to the office\nTo call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually ... got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't do this what\nYour wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well 'cause she didn't have confidence and then they\nWill look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out the the power would I mean we are on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere\nWas make things do you listen to ditch the thing that's bag it I mean or or did she gives it sounds like maybe she didn't believe in in ... well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in did you think that means you are you are what two three years into this thing and it not only are you not making money you are in debt big the big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more fortunately probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere
