Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty certain levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class on one day I came across this poem tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage exert a full time and you know three syllables per line was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and that was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that are still not\nBy heart diplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Eighteen hundreds at\nThe court of queen\nAnd he wrote a poem for or this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first yeah okay\nIt's called a ... done was that in ... to a sick demos hell so to speak it can lead to us that young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't look boom drew Lucy ... piece of guinea who ... ... to be to the mall ... to\n... see onto the taboo ... to ... to ... about it they held on for ... to ... ... ...\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks when I was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... and [noise]\nOkay so he reads the boom files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishers for [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into the number of ...\nIt ... to ... to ... ... ... for ... to ... I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks and you're right it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... and [noise]\nOkay so you're ... files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast forward about Twenty years publishers for [noise]\nThey become very popular in the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says he got this home mommy none of us who who doesn't look\nBooms and if you just focus on the words that basically just the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison says ... I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world in order to get out of bed eat some jam\nFew too so you don't look so pale and you lose your lumps shaped tailed dog units are like get better here's to your good health\n... D want something done I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted and us and and this is key for dug it also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA BBC CD and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in a moment of ... the oh and I forgot did I say three syllables per allow you to know how yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the bottom for example vast sea onto the taboo ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the\nBoth per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the bottom for example vast sea onto the boost used to like this land that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of spurting\nBlood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can in the dead of squirming in your bed of slurping sloppy and in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't AOL very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a lot for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sunrise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear\nSo claim on his now Douglas Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the little jam became bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words\nBut the words represent concepts and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on her just some people like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it [noise] and uh Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fleet off with Clement who\nNo bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French\n[laughter] I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well I'll give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fully off with ... Clement who calls for\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous he\nGot the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number so that's just the lines though no no no no no claim on level wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming until the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat one regard Otis hard ... who's colleagues friends chicken the decree a fine day\nEven got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the group that was all bird themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French bread you

raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he sort of insulted by the question and I felt so remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much and are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is when are you just talking about this or are you doing something\nMaybe threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or withdrawing support and Terry says I Am very seriously talking about we have\nPreviously called for the release\nOf these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most

I just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through the same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it does\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation and he has the whole bit it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST he goes no goes it's in four different things\nIt does our reactions to it that actually have like a kind of a negative fat and it gets worse with
