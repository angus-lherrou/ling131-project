CCF them woodland park\nWhere you're [noise]\nYou're listening to radio land\n[noise]\nYou are listening to radio lab\nRadio from there'll be you and why [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must but we know is it is on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may want to measure went on it yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand eight Georgia how about with a song yes please [noise]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [noise]\nFacebook [laughter] yeah [noise]\nIt was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there or you didn't work either\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling from\nNursing as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point [noise]\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken of themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nGetting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud Facebook to face with rockets\nIn global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those free speech [noise]\nViolence against working mostly what we can say and what we can't say\nThat again but I'm just like ... what we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\nMr soccer America got to\nYou some jak differently prioritize or sensors ...\nCongresswoman we don't grow overdoing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you print it off\nAnd diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand it the morning that you could argue started it\nAll [noise]\nSo ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand eight the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\nBecause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to\nThousands seismic change in this leak and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path\nAnd ice based on it now than a website in the U.S\nThey still had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook and\nOn Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what\nKind of they had a set of community standards but they're at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ... and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until\n[noise] rise fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who\nHad organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then changed their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not obscene and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for in Harlem the on photos of women renovating their children taught him twelve thousand members participated and the media requests and started pouring and\nHave them banning is not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print and Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nThere is a floor in this building where faith as sources content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start out sourcing some of his work places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and drawl as well as I mean I Would guess\nTo start out sourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora ... as well\nAs I mean I Would guess that there's people building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stuck seeing where they are still should cease to treat everybody fever English and we sent\nThem there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I'm getting some kind of hung up we\nFound out pretty quickly or none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting even happening\nA lot of all the good work and [laughter] now I I started to buy these you know\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her to you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just landed history I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract prohibit any ... about ... ... watch\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want you\nKnow I I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five thousand test every day I was just at lunch and ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he he said basically he'd have to go\nEvery day it was just an image of sessions and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day oh\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nI don't know if that's just like they were they had to I told us to X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things federal\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with all the way it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch him self thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were never specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so the Clintons ... life I laughed at us it was like okay so what I like Ike heads were exploiting as I Know I have to walk away\nAnd I just had that I chose to real [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's a classic it's yes to\nA different moderator I spoke to describe it as being the worst side of humanity you see all of this stuff\nThat you and I don't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or terrorist propaganda\nA ... they're getting better automate that but yeah the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags and on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automated\nStory here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming up there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke to readers hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back I think we should\nHi this is Jenny calling

you don't want to hear this kind of thing and and give me their kids in the room may want to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAnd Carlin Rhonda Marilyn sorry but my aunt had him up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise they wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carlos\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs

the debris and one of his legs it's completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\nMeanwhile similar CBS studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOnline and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly started going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially the photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are\nExceptions there is either either mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThat in other words this is uh\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but\nBefore they can pull the lever words start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes so um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher were but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you\nWant or yeah it is it now in news organizations strength parents do you get\nA I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and bill product\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nThat could change but setting that aside what were what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting more important and what what people find newsworthy ... they'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of
