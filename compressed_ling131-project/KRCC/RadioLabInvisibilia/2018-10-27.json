I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away they it's gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin a hit also seems to have gotten him yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nShirt in Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post aren't going to fall he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people does Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for the middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nPenn who looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near Brooke compare the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people died he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard\nFilled his voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing them play the game and his back and I\nHad been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Friedman\nLaying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and clearly walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning at about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by\nIt was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a ring for trolls men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopter\nAnd through a ... for trolls men armed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling and trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID the\nThirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape served seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all are well one of the\nDoors are short people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fat let them figure it out last night and the day before that they left their tense up left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers\nSo that the man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food in those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow elite that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... Blanca spotted Guerra\nThese freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and scare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the\nFoot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThey took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're going to end the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but you wouldn't talk\nAt this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things to so fascinating about this case is there a law professor at least ...\nIt it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that it's so fascinating about this case there's a law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani Frank H army\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is our money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights are like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah life you're strong to ... you need a forty five and a or juice had the feeling that this guy is dangerous a love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one one\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit\nWe thought we were being followed by the state\nYour food if you don't in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose a need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get\nHere this may be as far as we can walk up to the old abandoned mine\n\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren McCain street and the town to provide their Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the mind of their what is clear to them on it was this sort of hilly area south side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this hair is used to be an roadway [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills fairly seats there were no leaves and all the trees were\nBlack and I'm Serious skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they could've came in here so\nRight up there so here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild tragedy choose for is looking for the case [noise]\n\nBut in other words looking [noise]\nWe found this for her fans\nTo allow you see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for them just as good any such yeah we don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you hope my feet and left me\nLay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe of blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself the some of which does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your\nMoney back up very\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where ... had said he'd left her\nBut our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about\nThe bodies of these girls so let's see how that play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be ... that it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired\nDetectors and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think\nReally tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only\nThe agent of plant or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right if there are ... building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course a soon and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] 'cause his du da other daughter or my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and one or\nIf you have to be a man I'm On a few big ... the parents\nOf the family and yet you you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] Hi this is already from Arlington, Texas radioactive supported in part by the Alfred P funk

I'm I'm rods I'm Robert Krulwich has radiolab\nAnd now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right and they knew they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they had found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThey take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take a little well\nThat's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from ... perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police\nThe kitchen but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detect McCabe and the district attorney armies office and when they met Armenian biology search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer do do do the job\n[noise] uh I mean I was a good lawyer was\nI thought so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York it was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp and I agree on his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest\nNew York that was being taught at Fordham why don't you stand up um I agree\nUm his duties to his clients who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen in sitting in on these classes and and talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... ... ...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with\nA family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who had gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law school and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught us the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you\nAnd comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard than it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that is\nMaybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal so a lot in their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period\nAnd as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered any one law professors law students there um\nWhen they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain that I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess\nTo side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree pass too much sleep ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and [noise]\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had better than just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and so to live [noise]\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had great future I had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo horrible to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter you know would would accuses for protecting the person to kill her\nNew justification you couldn't just ... my mind\nExpects them but we lose [noise]\n\n[noise]\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "RadioLabInvisibilia", "city":
