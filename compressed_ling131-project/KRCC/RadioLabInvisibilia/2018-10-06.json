I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before then said something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good to ferry where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it\nWhat are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when I became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like the ... what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire and they arrive hasten Harris than didn't vote for John are and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYou know the problem is we don't know we have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part and I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something\nThat's unprecedented burned so birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... government then sat down and thirty\nIt is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something\nThat's unprecedented Brazil burst study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... and sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nOf things that have been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila photos with tons of papers and spread across an entire desk\nA combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings the represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an arm stuff's packed wizard chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions from lesson\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an arm stuff's pact or chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the number of states that have about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most\nBasic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to shoot that's right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the ...\nThemselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting that is right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nDo the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than\nIf you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but some further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this\nIs only one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's [noise] gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were and why we want to start\nThis methane gas bill just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this ah claiming investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a call on this is the Cato Darryl police ... Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nTo where we were in why we want to start this afternoon ask judge still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this uh supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nIt was a horrible thing and a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me I think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with\nIt was a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged and so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right and if I'm having\nTo get in this country around\nUs in the region where it was like ... veins something happened in you know here in Florida\nSay anything\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the moms they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shops\nLike you guys do this every every event or for not just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone about Dan\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this thing and this must be part of the different types of learning center part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is that first of all gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew\nTwenty four team but no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a critical gathered like probably Fifteen\nOf us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand because like if you want to do like\nYour house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just you will go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in Thailand and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun [noise]\n\nHim even before they all gone out dancing together and [noise]\nDifferent summer's wildfire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we starting to stay over eight inches of houses\nWith leaving each other bad on the couch you know a metric it becomes like a huge sleep over in versus the corn asleep for talking you know getting to know each other every time we started by shoulder thoughts like therapy for I\nHe's let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me believe or add I'm Marlon Brando\nAnd it was when the lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by the squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass we usually the video\n... let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at\nA sex and violence promise to [noise]\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that time behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nCame in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are and says the guard I Want to say and\nWing and all that but I I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and papers that we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you play any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm cleaning onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat ...\nFinish brings you right back here mhm\nIn\nThe toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\n'cause I actually started ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\n\nThen you don't want me to a Texan my find the best model what about let me\nA couple of women had their phones my fault you know what to do it\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face at three to one\nThree two one [noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to take some might find to be a lot of what about let me a couple of women handed me the phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith the sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nLet me all sort of walking back to put the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing that with us because I Know [noise]\nI Know yeah we haven't been I have\nIt was a sort of very faint we've run out once a week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning\nThat's what I remember at the end I used to tell you how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son was about Fifteen minutes at every time I visit\nHome I have to go there and I saw yeah that was for how could you not\nYou know what you like you want to go take a tear ... fair yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like it's a it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share\nEverything like that are like he literally I think he he does he liked to have lunch with every day\nBy day and we don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that is a little while I got to always sit down\nHe take his chair I Campbell holes I Would I Do with\nWith um [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just the ...\nI Would I Do [noise]\n\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nJews on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watch as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nAnd it was rather tend to a few of these women started called themselves the mothers movement [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C. [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the kind of support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nAnd they're so stay with us\nWe know you're going to get so stay with us [noise]\nHalf a block away this shirtless black guy and\nThe kind of talking on the cop wearing the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big ...\nThis shirtless black guy answering show\nThat's the kind of talking to them ... and this black man he got his arm raised pretty big ... walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I gets closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body chemicals out the taste of the other officer out it was added a free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe gets within like ten feet of the cops\nAnd then the\nGuy was funny camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nOfficer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot out of your best shot I say if you want to die if you want a dog you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nA fan of counseling wanting\nMe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what ... is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn judge died when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that tastes\nFor a car [noise] put 'em in [noise] and the UN's\n... said this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the corner tried to stab woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't\nJust a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after he finished watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nSomebody get through the neighborhood you might miss it on the phone step waves ... what are you doing man did Derek does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the winners ... heads now listen county sheriff like she would was elected the sheriff of Linn county\n[noise]\nThe county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called her which decrease executive research forum it's a big coalition and police chiefs and in twenty six team put out what they called her thirty\nJust a few months after I left will last say primary election among the winner states ... change his now militias county sheriff like shit would was elected sheriff of Linn county\n[noise]\nWhich is the county that they told them each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called ... which decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition of police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being some beans law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope\nRight and that sort of felt the same way too\nBut
