Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\nLike to have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nAnd so her books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing\nI can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these\nGray Davis you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James model of a sudden he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells in his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nThe person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very\nNarrow way I mean like you mean like ... men or actually free men were persons\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now all human beings are considered to be the person\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now no all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons big it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so\nIt can you explain how that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park has real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer I\nKnow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless that millions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human out when I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of nonhuman animal some legal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream that\nWas my goal and a night\nI'm nonhuman animal some illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand\nWhat the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal\nRights to animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after he got\nThere James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was against all baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd he said this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for I read of habeas corpus only it's it could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume without this\nHe was not eligible for I read of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have used corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the\nSlaves had walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your genes summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place\nAnd bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that\nThey are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and\nWe filed a hundred and sixty pages of apple Davidson\nWe say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex\nBeings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being\nTo being sleeved is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nMoney I'd like to joke that\nMoney I'd

Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income\nI Would of course\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber one solution buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the\nTypical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chain but uh but this is a path to old is the idea [noise]\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware\nGoing to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to say to your friend I think we should populate out parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all the\nSeparate his recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be to be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million\nPounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince\nPeople and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes every easy\nUh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially
