his therapy [laughter] you know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or the challenges to humor right\nIn the I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started

to open up a conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patience\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is that\nIs a joint and shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nA shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nA trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in not too long afterwards you know something happened back in New York

about Muslims they have great for a recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign abiding bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one\n[noise]\nNo longer feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that I continue telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changed all

standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nYou know a lot of difference between the three of them do incredible that I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing performing on stages
