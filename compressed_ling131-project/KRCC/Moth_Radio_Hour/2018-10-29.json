[noise] every tone and mosque thank God I written stories from friends of mine here [noise]\n\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and to know books and pens and a few thousand\nDollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war it's arguable to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words of civilians\nAnd it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces are and they took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nRemember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the ...\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to freak out I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists were driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebels stay stepped out of the jungle\nIn front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight\nAhead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the boy comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes\nAnd there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in\nCombat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was a really quiet hot day nothing was going\nOn I was leaning against them sandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face and would you have to understand about voices that they go\nSandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives a moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about\nWell I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that guy and he grabs stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof Bessie grabs his stuff it's throwing a motor soldiers do the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very\nVery brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve Italy\nWithout it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan\nAnd we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip so I had to go home to kind of he allowed So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they dragged off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that seemed broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Tim knew that if\nYou're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how what he did it he got down off the mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment um and er nothing you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "29"}
