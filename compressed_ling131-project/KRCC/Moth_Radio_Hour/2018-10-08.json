shouldn't be alive today\nBoth my parents were severe alcoholics my childhood was chaos\nBoth my parents were severe alcoholics my childhood was chaotic and very traumatic\n[noise] not only was my dad an alcoholic but he was physically abusive\nTo all the women in his life including my mother\nMy dad was the youngest is Fifteen and was abused himself as a child\nAfter his brother gene was killed in the death margin but tan during World War two he enlisted in the service\nAnd served under\nGeneral Patton in his third army liberating concentration camps\nIn Czechoslovakia\nHis brothers and sisters told me\nHe was never quite the same\nAfter he came home from the war\nMy mother\nLooked for love and all the wrong places frequently putting me and my sister in very awkward\nEmbarrassing and sometimes downright disgusting situations my dad was her third husband out of eight they divorced when I was seven and abandoned by sister Carolyn I over and over and over again they were just two broken themselves\nSo every few weeks they would move us from relative to relative to relative I ran away three times\nTo find safety from my dad\nTwo of those times was with my sister Carol\nCarol being seven years older than me was my protector\nAnd when things would get dangerous Carol would find a way or make a way to get us to safety as soon as she could\nIn the third grade I thought we had finally found stability with our mother and her new husband\nUntil I was called into the office at school one day and they're set my dad in the office and he said I'm Patsy I've come to take you to lunch and I was especially nervous because we had just run away from him just a few weeks before that\nSo I went on one condition that we would pick up Carol on the way\nShe was in high school and walking from her school to get lunch and when we pulled up next to her my dad said and\nCarol come and go with us and she says\nSchool and walking from her school to get lunch and when we pulled up next to her my dad said and\nCarol come go with us and she said dad I'm not going with you I'm not going with you ever again\nAnd then she looked at me and said Patsy get out of car I was paralyzed with fear of what my dad might say or do if I made a move to get out of the car\nHonored to be here tonight and to share with you a story about trust the air was twenty ten and I was Nineteen years old when I moved back to Colorado Springs from Indiana\nColorado Springs was technically home to Indiana felt like home to me is is not where I wanted to be and I felt lost and alone and so I joined a local house church there was about twenty members and it was filled with people I had known pretty much my whole life\nFace was pretty much the only thing that matter to me at that point in my life I was sold out to God and Jesus I Lived with compassion and forgiveness and I was still so desperately lonely and there was one person there who noticed that in name\nHis name was Greg and he was a pastor there\nAnd he saw that I really needed something but no one noticed I noticed him back he was handsome and charming and well spoken and charismatic and knew just what to say I didn't realize that I was walking into basically a trap\nWe started a romantic relationship pretty quickly and the abused also started pretty quickly\nI was with him for about a year and over the course of that year there was mounting physical emotional mental a lot of spiritual and even more sexual abuse and I didn't allow myself to see any of that because I was as a Christian supposed to forgive him\nAnd so to take care of him and I didn't see myself in an abusive relationship I saw myself\nAs someone trying to save a troubled person and someone trying to come alongside them and and love them as Jesus loves them\nAnd so I did not allow my eyes to be open to all the hurt that was being caused to me that ended on October thirtieth two thousand and eleven when he raped me not for the ...\nHurt that was being caused to me\nThat ended on October thirtieth\nTwo thousand and eleven when he raped me not for the first time but the circumstances of that morning we're cruel and clear enough that I was allowed a window of time to see exactly would have been happening over the course of that year\nAnd thanks in large parts of the help up my brother I was able to exit that relationship safely\nIn the aftermath of that kind of trauma\nYou're not the same I was not anyone that I recognized I was a broken mass and so he turned to the people I turned back to the church and the reaction that they gave me was essentially you're you're a messy problem and you need to fix herself\nPretty much all the conversations I had could be summed up by one that I had with another pastor there named Ben\nI came to him about a month after I exited that abusive relationship and told him Ben I'm really struggling with suicidal thoughts I Know that's not normal I Know that you shouldn't think about killing yourself all the time but I Am and I know you're supposed to talk to people in that happens\nAnd so I confided this and him and just ask for help and he looked at me angrily and told me showed their children in Africa with their limbs flown off you don't deserve to feel this way just because of what you've been through and that pretty much\nShut me down to opening up to people I think I subconsciously adhere to a message of people are not safe and so there are a lot of ways that people deal\nWith the aftermath of trauma and my chosen method was to shut my doors and windows by a very large German Shepherd named ... who loved only me and hated everybody else and watch every episode of law and order SVU that I possibly could as they say from the world but I didn't let anyone else and\nExcept for one person who made it past those barriers and that was a man named Paul\nI had known him since I was a child and he was a very dear family friend\nAnd he wasn't someone who just said he was Christian a lot of people use that word\nI think a few people are really able to live it but I watched him for most of my life and he lived every day that I saw serving other people and coming alongside them and when my house burned down he was sifting through the ashes and and the wreckage of it with uh\nSo my life and he lived every day that I saw serving other people and coming alongside them and one of my house burned down he was sifting through the ashes and and the wreckage of it with us\nAnd when you heard what happened to me\nShe reached out to me through my family and shared that he had also gone through childhood sexual abuse in the church and was broken hearted for me and actually paid for my counseling and I'll be honest I probably saved my life\nBut he didn't just do that he didn't just throw money at the problem he also met with me and emailed me and would invite me out to coffee and he was okay with me being\nA broken mess he was okay with the fact that it was not the same job that I was before that I had no idea who I was I didn't even know if I believed in God anymore that I was angry and then I did not forgive Greg and that was All right I didn't have to be anything except who I was any became very close to me\nAnd about four years after I exited that abusive relationship he came to me and said Joe I'm starting a drain group and I would like you to be a part of it\nAnd my heart dropped I thought a hell no because the journey group for those of you don't know is a group that is\nFocused on helping those who have been through sexual abuse in childhood abuse in the church specifically he'll so it's a group of Christian people and I kind of foreign off groups of Christian people after what I'd been true\nBut that was a moment in my life where I sort of thought to pass laid out in front of me\nAnd the one that I was on allowed me to stay sort of safe\nIn very high walls where I didn't let anyone in and there was another one that he was offering me where it required vulnerability and trust and in that moment I decided that because they trusted Paul I was going to get that one shot\nAnd so I did I joined this journey group it lasted about a year and over the course of that year it was honestly a really good experience there were six of us it was very intense\nBut I did learn to open up and trust people a little bit and experiment and vulnerability and see how I could stretch myself and tell a little bit of my story and get to a better place\nAnd Paul didn't just lead this group and then here to the curriculum he also expanded on it he would take us on trips and pay for it and he would ...\nWe'd this group and and here to the curriculum he also expanded on it he would take us on trips and pay for it and he would also encourage us to really really tell details of our stories\nAnd I thought this was all very normal because it's Paul and I didn't mention this but every other member of this journey group was female aside from Paul but at the polls so that wasn't weird to me I'd known it my whole life I trusted him that was an abnormal\nAnd during the course of all of this I met the love of my life Brian right there who is the best man in the world and Paul actually did our premarital counseling help us work through a lot and married us and\nLife was going pretty well I was getting to a more shield state I understood a little bit more about who I was in what I'd gone through [noise]\nAnd then on may twelfth of twenty Seventeen I through very roundabout means [noise] found out that Paul was actually registered sex offender\nWith us three convictions of sexual assault in three different countries in Amsterdam Germany in the United states\nAnd suddenly the trips that he had taken this group on made sense all the details heat encouraged us to go into made sense or a much darker lens and how close you tried to get to me\nMade sense\nI told the journey group what was going on and and they told me that I wasn't listening to his side of the story that I didn't believe in forgiveness that that people can change aside from the youngest member who absolutely believe me because he had been trying to get her to go on trips alone with him and she was barely Eighteen\nAnd then I told my family [noise] and as I said this man with a very close family friends for years\nAnd they fed me the same lines and more than that they actually knew they had written letters to the court on his behalf testifying to his innocence and has good character I don't want an upstanding citizen he was and they knew that I was meeting with a sex offender as a survivor of rape\nAnd I spent three weeks arguing with them and trying to get them to choose me over him and eventually\nThey did and I'm Still not sure if the eventually they did is a good thing or not we're still working through it but that summer which was last summer\nI got to a pretty dark\nPlace I knew\nBut that summer which was last summer\nI got to a pretty dark place I knew\nI could not ever trust anyone ever again because he was the only person who made it past those walls she was the only person I trusted spiritually he knew more and more ... more of my story than anyone did\nI trusted my husband and that was literally it 'cause everyone else had seen had turned on me and there was no hope left for trust in my life\nAnd I became very suicidal and and in a bad place until one of my childhood heroes Chester Bennington the lead singer of Lincoln Park committed suicide\nAnd it was actually that moment when I realized I was on that same path because I had connected with chapters art for years and years and I saw myself and him so much and I knew that if I did not change something I had done the same path\nAnd it was really a moment for me and so\nThose rocks he reaches in there with his bagel black bake he grabbed the love Iraq he walks over with it to the where the lava rocks or at drops [noise]\nHe comes back it's another one [noise] or walk said over their drops it in a lot of Iraq sex or he comes back again gets the third one walks over drops it in a lot of Iraq section\nA didn't

squirrel put them back it's it's kind of like passive aggressive neighbors you know [noise]\nHe's to me he's kind of like my Yoda to my uh Luke Skywalker\nAnd that pretty much tells you everything you
