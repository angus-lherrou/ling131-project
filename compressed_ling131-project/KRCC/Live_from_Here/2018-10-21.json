missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecast was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself I was picked up the\nSleeve shirt when you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years and our cat was filled with stuffed animals they line the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and among the was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger they don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess that was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie after growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest place I could find but it\nTurns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards people stay there too long start to look like us funds that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of\nMoisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when\nIt's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on in the midst

wings [noise]\nTo drop me off downtown and I went out looking for a bar if you're looking for a bar or tavern\nBuffalo is a good place to look they have a lot of them and last call his four AM they say that staying up to open later gives the snowplows time to clear your way home [noise]\nI entered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of science coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired\nThat even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked he said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time\nIt's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell as saying who knows maybe it's me they smell\n\nEagerly place my order there's something great about eating a food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started protesting your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife now the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking\nI don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city you might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost everyone complains about their parents until they shell

lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different

championship this was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day\nHave you ever started to tear up about bartenders glory years only to realize there was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings [noise]\nBoy were they hot my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I wasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried to act cool and in front of a bunch of locals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot\nHave you ever tried to act cool and in front of a bunch of locals until one of the pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to
