Franklin version on amazing grace but it is an extraordinary a version of that song Greg\nNeglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this album piano with the microphone Nineteen eighty three on cassette one boy here ... you got to flip that over now right cassette ... was an antiquated or the technology oh never mind I'm you know I Am saddened\nBy what is certain to be forty or fifty years of Pashtun miss grave robbing of princes volts\nWould he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely but you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really loved the unbelievers song cold coffee and\n\nUh prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring you're right you know the street hustler why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and cold coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great last prints album like say the blackout\nThe hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scoffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially till Nineteen Ninety four are their equivalent like that in in these vaults I don't know there are revelations here\nI just don't know if I'll ever listen to it again\nYou know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a\nIt was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why is this even coming out and the more or listen to it I sort of got pulled into the idea that we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was prince\nUm you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished records in his vaults they haven't come out\nA so why this one he hadn't made purple rain yet you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary but we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtuous city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be\nSo unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting you wonder\nIs pretty bad thing I mean there's basically a a thirty minutes string of unbroken music here where he's just getting on one end to the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nIn\nThat great gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvent yeah he likes it out of church there's no basically it'll just Saturday Night local scriptures is there any more than ... now a real person who got your lovers are going to come home ... married don't you weep you know he's a\nHe's talking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the and the propane\n[noise] uh\nOh Mary don't you weep you know he's a he's talking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the and the propane\n[noise] nah not down\nEverything you do come back on me\nYou know ...\nSomeone who's taught at\nSeven eighty carefully\n[noise]\nThat's right Jim this is her second television collaboration with director Jon ... after the HBO series big little lies so we interview by asking her how she got into the music supervision business\nI'd start sort of following like I think most things I fell backwards into this field you know my first soundtrack album credit was project managing she's got a habit and worked very closely with Spike Lee's father who did the score for that album\nWhen I was working at Arlen records\nOr girl that I once knew who all of them had a friend or two she gave him time move with Enron so blind\nThe gum from far away and then go there all day to show the low end the which one which the ...\nAnd then I went on to management I kind of circles around that's for a long time in different directions and by the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came from a recommendation to June ... that was the first\nFilm I ever did on my own you know I approached it like this is what my artist once Julian this is what he wants to I'm going to figure out a way to get on [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou know losing your job ... didn't exist for a long time and it was one of those things that sort of of all just music and movies filter sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that or or Castro scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a ... songs from the pop music Rome or whatever genre into the movie to sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually play soundtrack album so addicted to the swimmer\nSwimmer that had the most beautiful American handling theme\nYou know in Spartacus in acting my record collection had almost equally soundtrack vinyl soundtrack visited band and you have always found that interesting and I can never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was a charm and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into moving more record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always wanted the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people bet on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work at ... in the other way because I just being dictated to from that direction to never interesting to me\nI think words evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a of a great movie you've got this increasingly important role that music is playing in them what intrigued you about these ...\nOf a great movie you've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director ... and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he said okay we're going here and all that was my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work\n[noise]\n... [noise]\nChain [noise]\nStrange [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO series you worked on big little lies and sharp object\nWas it they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV male characters are the ones who are the messengers the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about Disney so you know she is listening to some pretty great stuff PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing I mean clearly out of her her precocious little\nIPod you know telling her dad you know which Elvis song he needs to play no no no dog you could do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventeen stopping and then you know introducing the bridges to her mom that yeah yeah you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls [noise]\nNot want to come on [noise]\n[noise]\nNot in doubt\nNow oh\n\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composers that we are having to tell our motives story through\nOh it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer we are having to tone are a motive story through the license try on which is\nVery unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer we're going to handle all these emotional beads through our\nYou know through these characters and that's what I mean ... ... ... you know we just really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative believe through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nWas also a character in sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her iPod [noise] she's a fellow patient in the hospital or with Camille shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with ...\nHours teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin as a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhat I loved about Camille with it she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she's there with this young girl that you know kind of looks at her and says we're kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really looked into music and the girls like job just to follow the law but she's\nShe's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she's one of your own two girls and she goes but I can get out of here and that I Love that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking at some in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be an here and teaching the power of music to escape your situation\n\n\n\nWhat led you know really signed onto was music has a lot\nThan just some background than a restaurant or some pop out\n[noise] you know really signed on to use it because a lot\nThan just some background than a restaurant or some pop after\nSome video if can place and you actually important role in\nIn so many lives and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that come meals character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait\nI'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record and see what happened and you can fly off and it will be totally change your mood I think that the importance of it\n\n\nAnd there was a lot of Matias already to American Hustle I was like wow that was already featured in American Hustle or this or that which I which I Love you know and and and they've been wrestled does to you know he he said you know when you influence other directors it's amazing\nAnd she was like well I you know if there's something really emotional and warm about those rock songs and the seventies [noise]\nYou're in my life\n[noise]\nWe met at an ice rink where I was when you sit down and try and comes in Asia and you're you're right you don't have the worst of the Gulf War the sound of it really started with Fisher\nYou're right you don't have some more stuff that goes with the sound really started with Fisher such a first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher and\nSo those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm and that she said that we could and have power because otherwise you wouldn't like car\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things and that was totally film didn't want it and it may turn ... or so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed and I want seventies music\nAnd then we just worked really really hard to get what we wanted to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of like Tania was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told and you know we mark ... was so gracious because he had turned down\nThe dire straits on Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out spent four hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real and said I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can send the rushed and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet and why [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\nMysteries of the moon\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and then he wrote the sweetest note and said thank you Susan checkups I would've never knows that was it and he was so\nHappy to be part of that film and I think it's really about communication artist's artist you know more Craig's turn to do why it's important and why that music belongs there is uh\nAbout communication artist's artist you know more quakes turn to do why it's important and why that music belongs there\nIs a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. was just a baby bans on that point\nI it's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage of\nA visual artist and then also to to see that thing and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing chaplain is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see tunnel five three eight overturned\nLie just little\nHustle had a lot to do with whether or not backing the pilots 'cause that guy's got one has long after another as you're not like she you know but I bet that the influence of film and you know you're kind of think I bet that gave a lot of new life to that song because the crowd went crazy over it\n... it wasn't one of those of you know top twenty below you know greatest\nHits you know and he got he got a top forty there I mean every song he plays she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that too and you know that too and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for you so you're the\nMusic ... like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work or in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV besides your own projects what if you had to say to anybody give me an example of how music and\nAudio and video can work together to create something sort of a third thing that's the greater than some of the parts what what's your best example of that because\nThe Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate\n[noise] [laughter] I mean those are the things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight cowboy and my goodness I mean\nHarry Nelson you know when you have that especially midnight cowboy when you have that collaboration between composer and then\nAn artist like Harry I mean all of us are trying to keep making that\nNone of us have gotten their\nKnow\nI Can't really\nOn the show and\nThink about midnight cowboy and how that I'm going to try\nTo plan to make that dark in deeper and more [noise]\nYeah that's amazing and you can't even look at the graduate without thinking about the Simon and\nSoundtrack to them you know we're all trying to do that I mean we you know for sure I have anything that ever comes close to that kind of collaboration with a solo artist being able but also the industry was braver\nThan I think people just took it you know music played a looser roll it was more you know things weren't as managed as they are now\nAnd I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking the same\nSunday Morning ... I think you were inspiring a new generation they're all I Hope so I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming on John dependent I'm great thank you all\nThat wraps up our interview with music supervisors Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what the film and television show that you think uses music really will give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your answer and tell us why [noise]\n\nEight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your answer and tell us why [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nWe've had a\n[noise]\n\n\nHas over the place where we like to take a trip to the desert island pop a quarter in the desert island drew box and\nPlay a track we cannot live without Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music\nAnd the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on movies are not going to make us my wife is the editor of movies at your paper ah she's up and bringing something home and she had to twist my arm\nTo watch this film that she was excited about and I was skeptical Nico Nineteen eighty eight\nThis is a twenty Seventeen interesting collaboration between artist in Italy and Belgium", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "21"}
