I mean I can feel that blossomed so great more to come from you met but we want to save your pick for\nThe end as we do with our guests on the show and we're going to go round out talked about her songs and let's start with you Jeff\nWell there is a new film out it's called ... and my rock and roll heroes wrote the title track me a ... it's Tom New York [noise]\n\nI think disarming just has a beautiful melody and because of its sportsmen really\nSpeaks to me and I just I just loved the army works\nAbility to\nPromote musically\nI think Tom York just sort of where's it on his shirt sleeves\nBut every time I listen to it and every time we do a couple of Radiohead coverage and eat it and it's just some of the most part of the night for me because it's so fun to be ... those things that somebody else did like you can't not feel it but if you spoke to him about it if you could speak to him about it you'd probably say yeah\nYou're way off first [laughter] like he just as this incredible\nAbility to be a\nTo my anyway yeah you almost feel sorry for the guy I Do but he's so good at\nA motor only from Norman [laughter]\nYep sorrow and then just incredible and be\n\nAll right so that's my pick from Newark radio ... single\nJake what are you going to pull out of the woodwork well this is one that I was surprised I like as much as I Do miss is low the song is called a ways trying to work it out from the album double negative [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nI think this album is a masterpiece the whole way through it has this texture this crackle just\nDestroyed feeling to add that to me like immediately condors an image of you know wandering the desert in the post apocalyptic landscape and seeing a you know half uncovered boom box and\nPressing play on an old tape and this is what comes out and it's like just the sound of desolation but also incredible beauty I just love that sort of drone of what it is and you have to be in a mood\nTo listen to it it's great road trip music I'm driving a long distance to a place that you don't want to be ... not a bad thing to listen to is is a\nIs a good low record in and uh I don't know much of this but I'm intrigued to hear more of it for sure it sounds to me a little\nThicker than than their previous albums for this record they teamed up with BJ Burton who is a producer who worked with Justin Vernon I'm Bonnie fair on his last album twenty two million\nThat something he seems to be interested in this claim a texture and I really recommend them the record double negative it's by low and that song is always trying to work it out [noise]\nMa'am allergic our guest of honor today or what have you brought to the musical receive all run some vinyl they'd bring some vinyl\nI'm I inherited the collections of my older brothers and sisters editor is all just ten years older than I Am and so I had this great formative education in in music from the early seventies and um\nIt was all in vinyl it's a ritual and I'm also a photographer so I like the whole big thing in the big the ban I like to look at it I like to be able to read who helped make it I don't remember ever remember\nWho helped make it but in this case I Do and the music that I brought is by an artist named Bahamas from northern Ontario and now lives in Toronto I used to be a side man with sites and um this latest record is called earth tones and the record or the tune that I picked as everything\nTo everyone\nSites and um this latest record is called earth tones and record or the tune that I picked as everything to everyone\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOr being a lover of rock and roll and blues so my dad the on the weekends would come home and we drive around the island or go hiking and he'd be like you don't have to wear your seatbelt and I'm not so much water is now you know or or\nLike he was a big fan of the players you know Sonny Boy willing to and things like that and plus you listen to the what was going on in the day of rumors you know I must listen that al ... or ... the eight track of it you know in the car in\nTimes and I remember we had a Beatles album or rumors that he had a a forever and blue jeans\nWhatever that and you don't bring me flowers that would tell me a diamond album and he had a a but all those blue students but you know so the and the law I guess as long as the short answer your question yes and I'm very open to things you know we have a cover of a\nA personal Jesus which is all ... tune on yeah that's right and there was that kind of thing\nWhere I mean she's a to where I thought wow that's kind of a blues tune and I I usually play an open the here and I was like I was like wow that works really easy you know I'm pretty lazy I'll admit it you know it was like well I already got the lake so let's learn to to you know and I brought it to you and he was like man let's make it like a roadhouse\nTune and got ... and then you do these amazing heart so he got up from the console of course when I was just recording do and he just plugged it in and he just started playing while we were playing but this one was like wow this is such a great tune about\nThe modern perception of Jesus and all these gurus that we sort of take or these these preachers that we've turned into rock stars you\nYou have this amazing ability to make your record sound like it's a party is through one night well thank you ... people but done extremely well not like out of control and and you know the levels or where it it's like eight of the round so spontaneous I can like\nYou're the host of this ongoing musical party\nThose are where it it's like eight of the rounds so spontaneous I can like you're the host of this ongoing musical party everybody wants to do\nAnd I loved that spontaneity and you know she was really I call my blues group because I'll go in there but like I just do one take man and that actually happened on hillbillies input blues those are really off first takes and that was the first time Chris and I got together on a project and it was just really spot navy and we were just in his own you know but that doesn't always happen in the studio so sometimes you want to safety tracker you want to really work on a tune\nAnd uh you know a few maybe do that sky flour to and like\nYou know probably three dozen times anyway I don't get enough topic and I'm joined the tea and\nYeah and I tell you is energizing um you know you were mentioning Hugh Hugh ... from New bone we've had the pleasure of hosting at one of our beliefs festival right and blue ... he has three for three years yeah and a wonderful man that we have great conversation\nA couple of other people that you're working on a on dial it into\nGee loved ... fray here\nYeah here we met twenty five twenty six years ago and he's still going strong so he I I we listen back to the tracks and you and I will listen back to the tracks with the Christian I just cut\nAnd I'm having a kind of a listening session sort of thinking you know it's almost like a I make like a painting like we put some initial strokes on there\nAnd now what do we do to accentuate what's the song is saying you know more like let the idea drive the car you know and we can be in the back seat and sort of maybe suggest the way to go to the where we want to go\nBut really letting the song and the the the the essence of the heart of the song\nAnd he just turned me and we lived through the good guy leading the charge like he's like sounds like a ... special sauce on man and I said I Know Garrett tobacco day you have a call you know and so he was like oh man you know I haven't heard very little was a man and get this tune maybe we'll play harp on it and things back again love to do that so\nHe was his gracious to do it you know just as a favorite of me and a sweet ended up we put hazel Miller on the trial oh yeah and I'm so she was really gracious we did is that a\n... this place up and as for near ... a friend of mine a has a studio up there and she drove up and and uh staying back up to ... like a Mavis Staples like you know take it a church kind of thing and she's really spiritual wonderful beautiful lady and she was just she was she's totally dot the river preach I think she's like\nNine that like sort of judgmental way but she was a curious like are you reading and I was like well I'm kinda like a Buddhist I'm studying mastered divinity I'm kind of interested in spirituality she was like you're a seeker like I appreciate that\nIn a way but she was a curious like are you ... and I was like well kind of like a Buddhist I'm studying master divinity I'm kinda interested in spirituality she was like your speaker like I appreciate that you know and we talked for like two hours and then we did a session to get like an hour you know it was just it she says a beautiful human being\nHow do you have got to you and that's an adventurous I'm going to ask you to do that to other adventures they ask you about just because [noise]\nTo great effect to working with the metro NASCAR of wire wonderful man that is that is a beautiful found at the guy was that just a I mean I just had this image of you in church or the microphone you know in the choir director there is\nThat all that I hadn't heard this money ... quote and he said if you want to know about the blues you got to get to church I was like man I'm not going to go uh he was raised was like sort of a pickle Presbyterian stuff man it's like sounds like a funeral service and not a good way to New Orleans funeral service where you say you know you play in the like slow tune and then you during the second line come and party and back you know\nThis was like a church tunes whatever and then I went up to Harlem\nI you know went to the bunch of different churches like this this church you know and it was kind of like I go to the river now green Everytime in Memphis you know the full gospel Tabernacle there you know that that's really the church you know\nAnd I'm so this woman vocal coach or my sister said you've got to check out this metro mass choir there putting it together and it was a weird like kismet like a auspicious coincidence in a you know\nBad things happen but you know you just gotta ... persevere\nThat to her soul for that was the first rehearsal on September eleventh and it was like what\nThat was a schedule like call people and it was like a hundred and thirty people all different races colors and greed this choir director was trying to do like this diversity you know like ... world community kinda choir in New York City and you could do that because you have all these different cultures right\nAnd it was just so crazy so that's what fuels the metro mass choir and then the choir directors like this in the city needs this so every time we did a performance if it was like we're trying to you know\nHe you'll and we did all kinds of so we'd at town hall and Fisher hall and and the Apollo you know these huge things and I I say in the choir for the first year and then the second year of this I'm older woman a retired from doing this still have joy tune and a a David Brown asked me to sing that tune\nSo you know it was amazing freedom because you had a choir director leading a hundred and thirty voices and they had a musical director leading a full gospel band so I was just you know they had me on a pretty you know\nA long leash you know so I'd run out and the audience and sing the song\nFor being so I was just you know they had to be on a pretty you know\nA long leash you know so I'd run out in the audience and sing the song and really get good people go on view in the spirit you know so that was just a wonderful experience and then uh that is going to run and ran its course for a couple two three years and um\nBe with with different ways you know it was like almost felt like the city had been a little bit and that\nBut a ministry or that\nThat motion or energy had had you know which is so strange like sometimes you have an idea to do something and then oh well we hope this was this wasn't really my idea this is sort of a great you're open to the healing energy is you know you can be part of the healing they're you know without even knowing it's like sort of\nTime on a non linear scale like\nAnd you know I'm the first to say yeah it was just a coincidence you know but it really became this real amazing healing thing for a lot of people well\nThat is for the gospel choir does really well but I mean you really captured something there and I do at that visual love you just all over the place or making stuff happen again is that that feeling that are a bunch of kindred spirits a bunch of friends are just coming together and making a joy ...\nNoise on to the lord and aim it where you want to know revving fee child your adventures could take you anywhere then your studies at your musical ministry and then a whole different way now
