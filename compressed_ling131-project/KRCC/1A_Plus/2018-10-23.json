Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim\nAnd I'm sure you're familiar with it too much Mr general\nSecretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise] the maximum\nIs do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nMachine here and some of\nThe pattern every meeting [noise] from the\nMeeting in Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative and Republican incompetent and he was just a very competent person or when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua\nOr in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of the man the humble and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this is\nProbably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua and uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants in his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country\nIs a whole address was about immigration how wonderful was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense it's dry reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nAnd he was very intense ... reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend in record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan in Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend an extra wide I'll work on it I think very much a very good bye [noise]\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for a very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal followings they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and the revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common perhaps that's the paradox of leadership\nThere is no one formula and no one checklist that defines all leaders\nStanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss that General McChrystal welcome to one a\nIt's an honor to be here Joshua we also like to take your questions and thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comment on our Facebook page tweet us at one essay or email one a at W.

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to lead but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear or they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effect\n... ... people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we say they're effective or not because you can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous we think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThe dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better I think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textural right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use them on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is change the followers are in a different place and\nIt doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and\nAnd we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and\nI thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWould I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still like a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven door so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nWhich very calm and I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWhich we can to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders and miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us\nThe followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in a certain emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comic she's reflects

U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a let's start with that title Trump the blue collar president I think it might be an odd image to call him blue collar considering everything in his house is gilded but I don't think that's quite what you mean by that yeah well\nListen I mean I tried to pick a controversial title I knew that the um the people on the on the left side of the political ledger\nWould be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um\nThe apartment looks like Louis the fourteenth smoke crystal meth and then decorated the apartment so I knew that would upset them by some footage and ... yes yeah but I but I but I titled it that way because I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents that never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really like them and they support him even to this day and so\nI think there's a message in the book as to why they do that I'm In and listen you know I uh I Try to open my mind up to everybody's fought and everybody's ideas I'm not close minded I understand the president as many flaws and I understand that people\nOn the side of the aisle that don't like him I understand why but I think the book has an important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle or don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for why he's at forty seven percent and climbing and why he's tightened up a um [noise] what could have been a blue wave these tightened up that race and made it a closer and why he's getting countless\nTightened up a um what could have been a blue wave these tighten up that race and made it a closer and why he's getting countless thousands of people to show up at his rallies I think what's important for people who leads to understand it well I I Will have to agree with that just hopefully they can understand it\nWell and I I think I understand where you're where you're coming from with that point it kind of\nProgramming on Ninety One point five K.

A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that oh this\nOr that or acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened Iran and out in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are are going to support Romney because you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution among something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle\nYou know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning\nJournalists interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and it weakened my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going a lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nAnd there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press as a communications director where you tried\nFrom well and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is a communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that it pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be having it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know it came from scratch so I didn't ... I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and ban and out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I would've been happy to do is I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude and a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm seeing rhetorically all having it\nNew Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying a rhetorical\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on that list but as far as like me any more than he likes to present your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... director is over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's going so poorly in the first six months\nI looked at what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well wait better served if we dial that down or any other thing is the president is a TV star ah people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with a Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with the crust Cuomo or somebody like that immunity doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also\nA lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay we got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that were on average ...\nMay be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ...\nListen I just left a morning show where these guys like they they ... them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThe left they morning show where these guys like they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we have to do that as you got to tell 'em straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and\nFew of sound the border to funding cuts we'll explore what those threats mean in practice that

in a lottery before we bring in a few more of our guests and get more from Sally let me get to a few of your\nComments in terms of what you would do if you won the lottery Steven wrote on our Facebook page I'd check off every vice I've ever dreamed about ...\nMentally wrote on our Facebook page I'll never win because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not\nSally as love you to respond to gyms comment in terms of finding out if you can handle the wealth wants the money got into your parents' hands how did they handle it\n[laughter] that's a great question and I'm I'm gonna agree with him and I'm not gonna lie everything even if I say something negative about the Wednesday I got an alliance that you have a correct yes we had a ticket for tonight strolling\nWhen they had no wait a minute wait a minute you already one way in life\nIt's a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one why do you\nKnow wait a minute wait a minute you already one you were born with a million or if you win the lottery ... when was\nIt was it may it it it's\nInteresting because he knew what people here eighty million\nYou know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the casual option that Uncle Sam has its hands out like\nI Need Fifteen times in the first year it just it really dwindle deal no please don't get me wrong my dumb and choose or not to tie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nYou know it it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share a small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally choose any primary and secondary education gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time they can do\nAnything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that your dream\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blessing my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right um so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents you know would have many many more storage I'm\nIn you in speaking about my parents it it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become\nExtremely private about this when my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\nBecause my parents one and a state where you could not remain anonymous for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they love to spend lavishly like it's like look at me where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway do you worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head and making sure everyone stays\nHome and um\nKids Iran's on my way about my parents someone hitting them over the head and making sure everyone stay how and honor I got\nTo know I I Know we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it ... what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight or if he won two million dollars each one two billion dollars that does that matter I think it\nIt's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great paint a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but not\nBig advice would be to be careful these are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with him in office is in a strip mall are handled your last or or whatever\nYou know you've had you know the scale of your new state has to match their ability to serve you\nAnd you know if you can't or may anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous as soon\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've got to create your own litmus test of who becomes your tried fried rice not your close family and it's not your friends slow\nI really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you a boat so we appreciate your sharing that with us thanks very much for talking to us\nThank you good luck to everyone with a ticket including us\nTonight we did hear from some of you who have won some lotteries in the past although I still like my rule if you win more she came when twice but\nDJ in San Diego did win the lottery DJ emailed not a big win but we want twenty six thousand dollars from the California supermodel plus some years ago got all five numbers but not the all important mega number we netted Nineteen point two thousand on one hand it was probably awash with all the money spent on the slips purchased in the years previous to that when\nOn the other hand the Nineteen point two K. was going in a ... minute people came out of the woodwork or shirt tales grew long the only thing I can remember is the purchase of our first flat screen TV and that went in the divorce shrug\nI continue to play Powerball and mega millions because\nWhy couldn't it be me joining us\nAnd that went in the divorce shrug I continue to play Powerball and mega millions because\nWhy couldn't it be me\nJoining us now to continue our conversation from W GBH in Boston is Jason ... a professor at Boston University's ... school of business\nWho conducts national studies on inheritance professors ... welcome to the program thanks for having me on also with this is Susan Bradley the founder of the sudden money Institute which deals with people who need financial planning especially financial transitions planting Susan welcome\nThank you so much\nProfessor ... let me start with you this gigantic jackpot how unprecedented is this for a jackpot to grow this high I mean I I Am I've heard that one point six billion is the all time record is that right\nWell one point six billion the all time record but it only eclipses the previous record which happened back in January of two thousand and sixteen or buy a just a small amount the last record was almost one point five nine billion dollars\nBut just to give your listeners an idea of how big new says if you pick the cash option and you invested in relatively secure bonds the amount of interest you would get after taxes would be about a hundred thousand dollars per day can you imagine spending one hundred thousand dollars a day in and day out\nAnd then at the end you'd still have the principal amount leftover\nSusan you've worked with about two dozen individuals
