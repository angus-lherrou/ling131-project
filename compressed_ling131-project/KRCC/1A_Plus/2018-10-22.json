A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle they may be the greatest parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our states Larry\nThat has a such an important point that I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared and a sense of normalcy returned to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nUp to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region we'll return that we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not the politically that that is a community that will be for me\nIs I'm no consequence there Floridians and they were part of a of our state they is often been forgotten forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define an economic future for that region that again\nCommunity restored we're also going to work with them to help to define in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of a state of Florida\nBefore we add one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit of one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures\nOf homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't were were were to fix basic that's right that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf\nBut it is not safe to live here you know it's\nIt's such a fair point uh and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increase storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nI but then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy\nI mean what less than right now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nFor having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an unreasonable way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out uh with these increased storm events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't\nNo that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out uh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea [noise] I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to\nBegin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda ... take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is at least Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you are or appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the VW well around listening area including Palm Beach brought in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and we're well aware and thankful for your mind or the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together they help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell ya I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together or for two years or making our way through 'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that the main then I'm going to convince them to believe in everything I Believe or vice versa\nI'm In Aspen Institute fellowship when we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is but the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so\nThere there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me and trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part of and you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can\nProduce and and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nOr one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you mean criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean a shape it shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when ah you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um ... that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience\nNow you can have the Ninety One point five ... the newsletter highlighting the weeks local and national news delivered to your inbox every Friday\nKeep looking up

I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nUm but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted in event\nUm um buddy quest for getting them I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there for their sort of baby doll\nEr which way it really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes um it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters\nAnd many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county I lose and none of the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Galen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more a matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... to make two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emails\nWe let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed mayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground as it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between what you're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home as your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened anywhere you have a window right to be just\nAnywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you've been able when you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nI'm In black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin in the trace of Martin the case of ...\nChildren feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin in a trace of Martin the case of murky smug locked in a and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both had weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover\nFor for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a fan of\nFans who writes for before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ... so I Would say one\nYes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these aren't extreme these aren't radical hours to buy the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play in our in our family picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nOr simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got a record store some decency here and unfortunately the inter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nGillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra

A. M. U. dot org\n... there was one more thing I didn't want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied\nWith the union that they're in grants and I can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiations for us on a road halfway\nSalary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries\nMore competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers are cute tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer\nAnd ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with a ... I Wonder what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I have not always been happy with everything that mining and has done the one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders and ends are driven by numbers and lenders and need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices and it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say\nTo fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than the after value ate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and part of the reason that's so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state or really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was says excessive all we could not have done what we did without the support at our communities\nAnd I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just about pay or just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and I have seen within my own eyes\nLegislators are repeatedly putting the interests of outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much thank you\nWithout a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union\nUnion members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you're talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question to boys think is an expert on down the ... and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and Barry ... district and I hope she makes that point of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also a new contract I actually I don't really contracts I should also introduced Vincent for new CIO he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle if I use me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor not a ceiling it depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con ... ... a context for folks maybe who never been in the union to know that it can be that ... their mileage me very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house oh\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees\nSo well that's right but before\nWe get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not a sale like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector have seniority built in or the only way to get a raise and by logging and other your other job hey I'm andme all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree\nWith Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice that allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nOf all that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR ride public radio international [noise]\nToday at ...

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want use their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a similar wills to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it\nDo you have to compel them to pay their dues be will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union be tempted on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThan it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nAnd they get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to 'em or or bar association fees or student loan fee or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it to the gym is overturned\nExactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court\nHas one of this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because\nThe issue was really on the outside that the the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined us however the case has done\nAnd what has happened since is that members\nHave stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states\nFully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside at school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a giants and the chance to respond and then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus ... case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOr in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time\nForbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work day clerk clerk or what you mean by captive audience meanings what what exactly are you referring to\n[noise] um well recent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "22"}
