A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to Yemeni friends in Sana'a and ... they are living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSome uh before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what is this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo and then this conflict is actually quite complex ...\n... it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you're hearing the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that the government at the ... the government and some odd that announced itself is actually in fact\nCoup government that has drawn by militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is failing to do all of the things that they're saying it's\nAnd now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no hosts the Bush on the ground\nOn top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with\nUh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was present for some time\nBut I'm the shared power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies are for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is it is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend\nOn foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I do want to talk more about the population on the ground that needs help I just want to move before we were next wars and also didn't want to be clear there was a sectarian part of this to you know these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslims Korean aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the shot and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as ... and it's really different from twelve or shall which is a the ... form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of Shiites them that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are shot values and the divide is\nClosest form of ... that resembles Sundance them a an Indiana and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to coexist for many years\nNow the CDs or the hosts the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they do use them as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize say DSM into kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has ... and ...\nHas struggled to maintain its sect as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're seeing is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south so ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost is a session\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying some are in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with Lisa ... she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living\nAnd working beer here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we used to be welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that he steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine\nNow in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation and I'm sure with deprivation of reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the road work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of and how the Democrats have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate it was last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely but we are seeing for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now during this program from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of context least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child to can you board was down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\nOne point five cares DC is dedicated to covering southern Colorado and the

A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary in aspects\nLike several of us and we have a memory of of age range of your students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims but then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of\nLost can you can you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what ... these people are with like why why does the sects why does the sex involved matter to this didn't you just kind of simplified force\nSo when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned um the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically has ADD and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the\nChef ... they're called ... now the ... conflict a kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation of religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam\nAnd that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the I'm\nKind of the guardian if she has them and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of sending them and so as soon as shower is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started we know that the U.S and then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal\nAnd you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the U.S and then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal on ... on the nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrifice damn end by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and and you clear and deal with Iran\nAnd at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay\nSo let me let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... years and watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and she is laments his old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run this kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of ... anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sex for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got some up all around the ... and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really sink our T fan but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics\nScribes story of an eleven year old girl but you encountered back in June but kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n[noise] sure I was telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just a tin steaks and I think than we we deal with it with a lot\nOf uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I I was in ... um which is a problem when sort of in northwest of of Santa ends controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd uh and it's mountainous in in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that did the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition ward and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall deathly thin\nRushed in with a with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was his eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too\nI think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to\nWhat we had asked at the doctors at that and it was absolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among rushed\nThey also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own and speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen\nAnd it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school\nBut whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago and he his salary stopped to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nIt's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen wants those salaries stopped\nPeople would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do

A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow goes through various struggles with\nIts class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to sense when you're telling a story about high schoolers well that's\nA great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involves we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\nCharles a story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really cabin who\nA bunch of Rebecca parish being Lou ... you know Charles his story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nThat are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be following and you know ... you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I thought it was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end up sentence\nAgility for fun to read it I watch every episode of America to me I absolutely love it\nI'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by doing either so full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eat or is that right see that's all right\nLet's that seem more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to thank for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stove all a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much for having professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest thing that struck me the ...\nYou watched the series any part of it some of it all there yes festival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThe thing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of a student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the\nEmpty conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the losing of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nBut when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us schooling professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nBut one of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do you believe that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not\nTweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor so what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people\nFeel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we\nHad it right I mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution so when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they need the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd that ... is the issue of concern give me an example of getting people what they need when they need a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse wherever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... what\nDo you find that the big barriers to advancing tore racial equity is it is it funding is it the people involved is a different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nThe wild world of mid term campaign ads and who's behind them I'm tending to Vegas and that's next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I public radio international [noise]\nTo take away today the Lebanon am on the one point five to your cc\nNow you can tune into Ninety One point five care cc without lifting a finger just ask your smart speaker ...

questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax cullop how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up it took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and\nScholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way ten push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make that\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue\n... performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not she can make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for any one high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of lay her essay is there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well\nI was going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also featured documentaries were like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare saying the other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already as saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine student teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it's hard to ... you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is blankets vices sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like meat luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself exactly ... that's just not the case you know I think it goes to showing 'em\nWhich episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids and his honors um tutoring sessions are usually white and all widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to ... on his tutoring but that's just the one right that you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carried tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nKnow it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like adding stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take it that might be you know an inch apart and\nThey're tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take kids that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in a higher tax get more they get better they can better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in a school or Ninety percent white and the least advantaged educational experience you know a places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms about the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black or a teacher in the series\nLament the fact that it's a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just ... it's a game it's in supporting game", "show_name": "1A
