judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed but he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn brought on our Facebook page you can't soft sell this anymore which unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks\nOn a chair and I did want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence she or a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court or you know ... like ... set that aside for for

John wrote in restitution in quotation marks much and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment evidentiary question of whether

seem to be more believed than others what did you make of that\n[noise] so this episode like so much and are\nHighly highly polarized society um is two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nOf sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so that's their view um the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I Know I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the Blasey Ford won was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in by many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in ... says the Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to the students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise] so um\nSo so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Boise for it's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of of um\nMaking sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part\nBut uh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise] so um\nSo so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Boise for it's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um\nMaking sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political hay with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well I mean she was part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and is unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said two Senate\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember when I don't remember how many years [noise]\n\nI don't know [noise] I don't want to I don't know [noise]\n\nAnd a man a man lies are shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor\nWas the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and a driving ah people ah from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of um absurd charges and not taking into account his whole life\nWas upstairs I mean she remembered many things that President did not cover himself with Gloria in that moment where he was mocking her and diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people are from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know uh if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that amount of early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh did seem to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually\nRather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in a cabin up in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nLousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but\nAbout temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that a Democrat said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they that that wasn't good enough um\nDemocrats sort of their their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about\nTemperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we

we keep going\nOn I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice\nWorth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business you're at but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jump in and do the ads and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about ... or their husband their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are\nReally scared about the standard that and I mentioned right the idea that a single accusation without any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized

hearing about fairness it was about fairness for their husband their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that and know what I mentioned right the idea that a single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nFish is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nAnd gene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about or justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd actually when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence or a yet or not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual\nSo and that's a very very broad description gr includes even just being funneled over your clothes against your will ... should be careful with the number yeah go ahead and go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it [noise]\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera so\nIt is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice in fair play\nThere was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera so\nIt is you know when people say well we're

justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nBut if you're like wow this is one of those moments early on and there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is fear especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better [noise]\nWell I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised in it was should he at\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is and met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that a ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter and that is simply a\nSort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and

A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you were just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending ill senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere is a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fast\nThroughout the years or every state has gone through its own hiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see from around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David you're in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing state of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington that Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as as well at the state legislative level so you have all of the states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of these states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the seats in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nGoing to get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as taught us topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election\nAin't that a load of crap that's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have\nSome gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district and an ink blot on a ... test you can find that quiz if

pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps this gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats\nWithin one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen the waiver Janine elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nBut but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the no party is blameless in this uh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nA reason to win all the districts around it or the a newspaper down and in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander it was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the five hundred\nA district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today a isn't to win all the districts around it\nUh the a newspaper ... and in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in Phoenix and democracy back in you know the five hundred BC uh\nBut when we talk about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the lines aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair but the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nDo get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read history by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil [noise]\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court with the majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and safe so publicly Katie Faye he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political\nHas been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors at approved by the Republican legislators nothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican Sherman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nTV fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks are that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all look to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that are falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level in Michigan we are a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe official that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least trans parents states when it comes to transparency in government", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "08"}
