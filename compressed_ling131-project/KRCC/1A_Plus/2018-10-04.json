start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAnd ... a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow um but despite having sat in Congress ... first so much time he he shows are open loading for\nAh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but\nIn the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating\nA lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that was that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I I\nBe a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eight\nAnd that one that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face is Fernando ...\nBut if it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to twenty fifty and this seemed\nLike just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of West\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people that both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit ah we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery ... of course ... has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to Wade guns around say that drug dealers should be shot or threaten to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the bt far less so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party itself now is very much hard left\nUm the candidate though is\nThat being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist ... um is this anti PT vote so\nThese elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not do you see a friend\nWe are going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft\nThe moment is that there is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that had been migrating kids far right extremist both an arrow\nUm is this anti PTA vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see X. president but about who voters do not see a friend\nAnd we're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls or what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than a decisive in terms of going there in changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time or one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the valley the votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we'd both so when they more likely according to the late ... that we'd go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an arrow has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine\nTrade by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there's not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both in our old has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waiting machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or for drug dealers are themes\n\n[noise] Hi I'm ... kind of the membership manager here at Ninety One point five years the on behalf of all of us here at the station thank you for your support during fall membership dry food not do this for gotcha [noise]\nHey everybody that this ... this is Christopher hello this is Michael from Trump spirit we seem to Ninety One point five K.

Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nA Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now\nTwenty six years later what political moments do you remember from the Nineteen nineties we want to hear from you what do they tell us about our politics today you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a\nYou can email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most divisive issues\nSince the civil war and we still have never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America\nI remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and nonpartisan\nSteve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton and then ... before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cab and he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the ... Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years\nYou've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party of the future meaning Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ... in the Trump beer it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it\nMe that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a Brock Obama including what you know what Lindsey Graham did demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election to lead to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham didn't run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixty\nAnd concluded what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it is not just that he won the general election or let the huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how\nWithin the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told and boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted air than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's then there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises idea change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security and this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells republic\nHey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you go off with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump in twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if when he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties\nVery tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that\nDoes not sound surprising to you yeah ... what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nI'm hoping Mr Manchin will vote for having all because we are conservative state even if we do put liberals in their\nView from West Virginia this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nSurvivors of domestic violence have limited resources and for immigrant women the situation is even worse survivors themselves want it to the care they feel that if they can't get a restraining order I don't say playing with the police they would prefer ... secret and underground network of support field\nI'm hoping Mr Manchin will vote for Kevin home because we are conservative state even if we do put liberals in their view from West Virginia this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nSurvivors of domestic violence have limited resources and for immigrant women the situation is even worse survivors and now they want it to the care they feel that if they can't get a restraining order I don't say playing with the police they would prefer stand location with the grand\nAnd underground network of support fill the gap for immigrant women that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I\nCan do to Lebanon am on Ninety One volunteer your cc\nWhy there's this is my age who is this is Jonathan from ... from the most at\nSeven and nine nine Ninety One point five ... he he\nNPR on Ninety One point five to your cc is supported locally by Colorado business bank or ... financial company providing personal service in professional bankers for business and personal banking needs from Denver Fort Collins a little too and to the ... valley in Colorado Springs ... bank dot com\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on

your shining city\nI Believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to ... or send you also remember him will will with us any off before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point ... Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question\nHis team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be unelectable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer really tried to scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending in Ninety two was the year\nThe media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign at Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing\nYou know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you\nThe next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public\nHave changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich in that moment with O'Neill what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or did Donald Trump do\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well it's it's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there what let's go", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "04"}
