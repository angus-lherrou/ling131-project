comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy and leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so a\nDot com is a ... it's basically a Twitter clone I'm an eighties was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter for for violating Twitter's communities sand\nI Believe so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots we're getting kicked off of Twitter uh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of a free speech but what ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism a and an extreme\nOr bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name was maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive event for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time a note noticed that ah that that this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this ... free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started way than they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWith it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily in free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\n... value speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nJacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... up the only place where this kind of speech proliferate so online is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment\nIt's not the only place where this kind of speech for fruits on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment with First Amendment lesson hate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful ...\nComments incitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given them a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like your\nShirt well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and bold and from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody on the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states\nThe situation in which we have somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and ... who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ...\nYeah I I I'm Sorry where am I going to do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of thought because a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other form of\nEvil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news\nThe fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nHey everybody this is Ruthie Foster this is Chris ... hello this is Michael from Trump spirit in Ninety One point five K.

mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left or people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a small school here in the city and in this in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable on college campuses feel that um\nYou know express a strong and here in state of Israel or express religious views that aren't um\nYou know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you were how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're a Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not particularly strongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a an friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left and that that's true\nI think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids it probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know and I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every us are\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly by students to do that and not\nThe not settle everything will David I'm that can be it can be very hard\nTo even let me put that to think you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rabbi what do you make of damons comment\nThank you day that I wanted to respond to you and just ask me who are speaking about\nTo you for sharing that when you put the ... Jacobs rubber what do you make of David Colman\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and stuff and we're speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to save Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which is not you can criticize any countries policies\nBut often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy is we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U.

A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover it and who don't recover so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York\nTennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements\nUm so how many hours messed a employees are employers and require training and so we've seen legislation on that\nIn um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tip it I Love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to HR and as a ...\nIt was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor she says she could not report the incidents to a chart and has a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to pose that on my social media and it can change your reputation I really wish I could protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had an accent that agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFrustrated with how common is this for freelancers and the and the situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year BU required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nIs true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our place harassment which is exciting that they've been need creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on as requiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there's no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because um\nAgain under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from the long overdue attention to workplace harassment\nIs some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean as a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\nI'm an ex politics with Amy Walter we

A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... jak since I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think I agree that\nCalifornia's been a real leader in the space both with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways\nMany states Emily that you're targeting in particular well I think\nThat one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator\nReally thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution Suzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators and really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nAnd introduce a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously owners are saying if we can begin to the line of aware nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose in contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however you does a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes so that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much\nAnd hold but just as it relates to specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that ... what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and there's another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they have hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line that case\nFor someone who stick with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you would have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes it clear that those can't cover a sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract that keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that\nSo the contracts and away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning us information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alix tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in shifts\nWhere and when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on email to my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise help bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and win state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in and out there\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state last day in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways\nThat their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment and schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about\nThat no matter you know what's it called they live in\nA suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed\nBills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers",
