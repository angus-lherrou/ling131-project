wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd Seth wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nOr do I know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances ... what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many\nYears ago Graham case it basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officer is engaged in the use of excessive force even less basically\nTake the in the state that\nThat is that's the fate of the officer so it's a very subject that standard what would a reasonable officer have done in that situation so it is not in that ... that is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is\nThe officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and that's a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing policed\nSo the excessive force you must basically take be in the seat that\nThe steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have done\nIn that situation so it is not an objective look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find\nVery few judgments first of all you know in in civil and suing police departments jurors have to again how hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge an officer have to look at the standard and say what would\nAn officer reasonable officer in that situation have done so it is the Supreme Court that has set\nThis rule for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the keys is Graham versus Connor Institute's from a Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on in officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like to do with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nMuch and one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line as

of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened that caused such a stir or did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually involved and the money that are kind of trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist or they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement and my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew

grateful to see them go because they drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\nYou know honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that officers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up or they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than going through everything

let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward it where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force does a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals are the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to ... and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable mess is\nOn us in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer\n... what was the officers thing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it [noise]\nActions from the police glued to the criminal actions to Cornell maybe you should respond and how do we suss out you know minor sense what reasonable mess use\nReasonable illness is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition\nAnd what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers being experiencing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so\nIt's there really is not one definition of it but but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is quasi militaristic\nAnd police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community if that's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals\nWho lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow the deputy ties to deal with with those\nKinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim communities are criminal and I'm not disagreeing with you just by way of doing some places where the lower level of sworn more enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as is you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have\nSome places where a lower level of sworn law enforce offer lower forms one officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different\nModel entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras\nAnd what what happens well we have officers so oh don't turn the cameras on oh we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talk to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have and experiences where you know we should simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with uh with I mean rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you\nKnow take away the guns for the first couple of months but leads to buy the inside of the community without guns make them stand community to force you might have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a little a lot better uh with serving a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in all people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police\nAnd I love you to respond to that but if I could first if we could contrast what Reggie said\nWith another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what ... wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the case is put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law out convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was a veggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cordell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people who are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecide to the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important for the community decides you know what we can handle these issues at ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBe whether you call them itchy for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important where the community decides you

U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from our current position Nikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHe was formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get or if you don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I'd done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the things\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in [noise]\nUm that's in ministry you can also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them ... you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next ... to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd this year's have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they can at the front\nAnd I will say\nThis um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nCan tell me she what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to the ...\nAnd here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me she went out and doing it for this one so I look forward to supporting the president\nPrices but as Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nAnd absolutely absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that orders toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be this one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about empathizing and being vulnerable and bing bing and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with a bonus\nThan talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble 'cause it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to the kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star star is tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nPuffy I yeah I just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so\nWe asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessment so people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton\nCatalog Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and I was like\nSo that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is that perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the newer and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really\n... the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really\nYou know and it's interesting what she said about scars intend to places not only does armor\nKeep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow and metastasize so we need to create were cultures were armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left

lead with regards to arm or Monday ... emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box because batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nDoing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I might protect feeling good about myself over movie and I work for it\nThe difference between so there's a difference between say arm\nAbout myself over movie and I work for it\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor an image\nSuch as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's\nIt's ... it's on a deeper level now it's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus during leadership has one form of armor we see a lot\nAnd folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor Cal punishing car tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest finance I think is that\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDoes or does your everyday traumas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of Anita Hill criticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we all got your\nDad who was you know but absolutely vulnerability it can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind of mission\nA little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nKind of mission statement or vision for clarification or posters everywhere but for those who are supposed to be and then\nIt's really worth nothing more than the paper on which was printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies were their value statement was like Fifteen bullet points Laura I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled to Merrill down to my to why only two\nWell here's a big\nOperation allies and values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really is it just really a poster so like I'm a recording of my head but little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what was so\nYou know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data that men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and we're like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage\nI Know that the core values because it's a place where every other thing on that list is tested and so we really we had an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own valley\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lives and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nTo make some of the values that you were to do with\nLike for example one of our values as take good care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't and so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught\nIt's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now it's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear the trial use I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you live near announcing my to core values are because I Know what they are I went to the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am to work I Do like\nI guess one sure can't try sure OK face no", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus",
