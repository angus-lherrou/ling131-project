A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about\nOh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um\nWe can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around in many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was\nHundred mastodon\nProcess required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back through time I mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important one of the things I Love to think about is ah shoney's was hunted mastodon\nHunted mastodon\nHunted messed it on and think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether they're intrinsically extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being and acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native [noise]\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it\nThey take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog and title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine not your ancestry and learn what your family's from\nWe did a program today's October seventh things we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to

spoke to a geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you are going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living because we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you ate progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court at decided to essentially and let it go into effect\nFor the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us rap Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger policies have Kramer ahead\nIn twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this lunar id law could potentially sauce\nNorth Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger polls have Kramer ahead\nIn twenty twelve set in the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially saw heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that in the north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law require\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box as they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot in the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population near

life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people do in the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style or fly\nOther eggs are heavy psyche essay lame and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the sentences from the last paragraph struck me

same way he did every morning when we were at a other school and Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told them with a knife away treated a knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes and often um and ... communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers and so\nBest friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a nice way to to the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out an elaborate without checking it out\nAnd that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move
