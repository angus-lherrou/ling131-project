speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I don't take an myself as very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like everything that they had to show up as adults and scream at every single day I had to show up and I went from math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math\nFor hope one by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching help lay the groundwork for activism [noise]\nUh you know it's funny I like don't take him myself as very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging every day like everything that they had to show up as adults and scream at every single they had to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever there and eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and it could be repeated back so my skill was like what I the lair with not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they can put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled they like they can get it like anything lower than zero there like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd then like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know them and I believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after\nWe're gone let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started below him I think Morgan's referring to protest\nIn my own community that like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know the amount I Believe they might not know how to use them and what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're\nGone let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\n... view his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah certainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who called us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organization to work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book I highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that it's important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of a street together\nBut this narrative to death I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat a catalyst for the protests there's just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nOr the the people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's sleep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end up ... the legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nTo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first part of the database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from this stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not this question of like profit uh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge money maker\nContinue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not this question of like profit\nUh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um\nAnd it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's a guy at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNot only does not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only this only a couple of months ago the first time and I'm actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents for the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us who wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable so\nSo but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives and like oh I made it gets ... and it's like well no you like see me on the news you hear him in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before and you know that there was any income and wealth it's pretty significant so I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free

I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass one would not ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi constraints becomes so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to manage and things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you think about it ever seen the writing the left is at the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's\nHow to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd Mike eating whether they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the laughter always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happened to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work that all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about my own identity I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just\nDidn't know it doesn't mean it wasn't real right like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nThat I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later and they realize that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a different in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nOpposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and they have to be\nYeah you know

we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave that like it is not one way right that there is not two ways to be gay they're like\nThe pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like he was one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I leave so they're like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that we know we're working with the research right now trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that are that they are actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns\nAnd they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd Mike so rhythm quiet worker on that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about the every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's not helpful that I don't want

dirty a\nBig amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a liar actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say ah when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh and I was expecting from the ...\nRunner in film that there's a line to actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh and I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be on oppressed or talking about a ... a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they handle all the uh director is bring so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um ... it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I Am doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word played the slapstick puns and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny um but we really\nAre mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus or you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here\nUh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season and what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions you know we we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus\nOr [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here are but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this story telling is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your ... [laughter]\nI'm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\n[laughter] no I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of\nThe the bubble um\nOr the perceived bottle of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak\nYou realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah we'll our net as Beau jak ... incredible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some\nYeah I'm see them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nHe was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda Lamont and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah it sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had them do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man uh goofing around going [noise]\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her\nUm how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast her we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because\nAnother show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't believe it on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well um we cast Alison\nAh in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast or we'd been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a a great job ever since um\nBut more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is like I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr try to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not\nA as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said and these other interviews\nI notice that change the latest on the historic deadly hurricane this afternoon on all things considered

either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so your your glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words in the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have versus ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean listen to a rally as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader and I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later\nThe audience will be like oh he's ... obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we were open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nSo your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there was one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cards and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of confirmed I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously until eleven thirty five PM I Wish it were that\nAll day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical working week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only print one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it will change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the\nFriday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's printed I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you a lawyer you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ... there's a little", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado
