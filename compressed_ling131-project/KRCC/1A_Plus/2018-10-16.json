be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions won't we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period than elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in

family is\nStruggling with to describe it and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information is like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to that the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think is\nThrough and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger and\nAnxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing worldview and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discuss last week on this

that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the year\nThe gated in their own personal lives there still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean just Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like a congressman from South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's\nThing I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow\nIn injure glacial state so we are in into glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this on this ... thing that I'm ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd the heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth killed as it moves around the sun\nSo I Want to show following you this heartbeat this earth heartbeat between poll too warm\nCold today warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that guy what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a youthful\nPattern and it's been ... that's been happening for the last ... million years we ... we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying earlier on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and the climate system can't take that\nForever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science food the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went

on it you know my my uh girls in school now\nAnd they don't have a standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now or it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is\nEducating people both at the consumer level and one of the things I talk about it in the books even at our most sophisticated institution so let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for a change in that it doesn't depend on just your behavior ... or ... which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know

having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even the meeting the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was a shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and\nHe's a really bad password we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the\nCold War in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live and\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nSo Russian uh now where not pat ya that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx\nHospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world work together to collectively impose it costs on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of why is

thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller said at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end these same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places\nBut the invaders those whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote\nIs this another Roman moment or we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major official to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica Becker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... division exploits social media in order to get their adherence to\nI Know you have a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica bicker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about of it as a case that looks from the perspective of a company\nLike someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out saying that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ...

Facebook\nAccount the most recent hack of the social media giant compromised about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers\nAnd this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress but his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good that connecting people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and it's Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful neutral for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we removed from face but more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags that for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on the content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's got to\nBe a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language has eaten so that's a big focus and are hiring once you're hired as a constant review or your ...\nTim reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise we have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used\nSo that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook to violate terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging in proactive flying how much of it\nIs the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with [noise]\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can ... majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words that I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work well we do some most of our past\nCould be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work\nWell we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise violating our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens in rain does we would still remember it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and there'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly\nSometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lay copy and then there's other options and in those other options there is an option to report somebody I Wonder how much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world as learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
