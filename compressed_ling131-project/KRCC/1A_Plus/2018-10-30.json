Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots\nKansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting look like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges ... turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million ads of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd a more expected this morning we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so um the\nDemocrats are starting to um get their ballots and\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them or they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me speak with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handled voting early\nIt depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request and you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who liked early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas\nSo it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had to early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out their ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to Broadway\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people um like the system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um and now you've got to think about um delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received in November sixth tens and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to live in a vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment for trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nUh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four\nHours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nMemberships or the largest source of funding at Ninety One point five K.

election day because I bring my children and want them to see and feel the import of this right\nAnd Melissa tweeted I loved to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nZoe I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're app when vox pop from Michigan who told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting have to do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year\nOr two constitutional amendments that try to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation proposal links to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier makes apps and a team voting available to all and finally to permit straight ticket voting\nThose are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling in for leaving us voicemail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that a kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking of that proposal to which is a redistricting as he is ... and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um\nYes ah particularly a profit to which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been at a bar and storm of a\nA ballad I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays for it\nThat is not usually how it works in this state usually a organization some kind of a political organization pays for signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Faye he twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de\n... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is kind of partition split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nI mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization got four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get the money from the device organization just last week uh putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is the promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in the country twenty seven states in DC all ...\nNot only are these popular ideas but a majority of states in in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me\nThat the ads we see here are hugely fear mongering are paid for by companies and they say you're going to lose on your job all your schools are going to close\nFire is going to rain down from the sky it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that ... says she's from Jennifer ... she's been seeing on TV ads\nSure it will be a ... to put a finger pointing at right now there are also a a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells\nAre just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's homes schools places at work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh the MIT pollutants um the oil so the other side of this as the oil and gas industry which is which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site a but just how difficult that is well you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent a new development would be halted\nA but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost and with it\nReconnecting with

Saturday's mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue the president had this to say on Fox News\nWell I'm just going to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt so that I really look forward to going I would've done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption\nSome in the Pittsburgh area do feel like the White House visit will be a disruption here's what the city's Mayor Bill de do said last night on MSNBC\nThere's a lot of work that comes into planning a presidential visit and it would just be better to let the focus of attention me with the family is tomorrow and not trying to detract in her place it somewhere else\nThe recent racial and religious violence in

I Wonder what your senses of what's going on in terms of places of worship being targets this isn't new of course we've had this attack in Pittsburgh\nThere was a shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship to make them such targets [noise] well I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so if you want to target and Jews\nShips segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so\nIf you want to target Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue ... going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people and go to it a predominantly black church I mean so it's convenient in that sense you know in this in the sense that it allows the\nProgramming on Ninety One point five K.

what role does face play and bringing people together\nSo worthwhile question especially after last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh and it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church\nBack in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that's suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their face\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential maggots\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently we discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation\nJoshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or tell us about your time to get here and we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas city's a downtown Kansas City Missouri was rinse Missouri in a couple in the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation are highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independents are we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country\nYou know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader speak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly better regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political and wish you wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms your politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely you know I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in the value system\nDo you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates and a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know tied\nPosted trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where are you saying let's just do a sermon on you know type thing or just do a sermon on actually the story of the garden to be anything but politics yeah so here's a so for the folks who are upset by it\nThey feel like I'm doing it all the time but here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning than an again probably something morning and so what upset is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these teams the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lucky electron ethics\nWe're going to look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I Try to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we're going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm gonna say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is I see this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns as a as a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measure\nLegislation to a year ago [noise] and as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things\nNow that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality and the actual policy yeah uh\nIt does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in the school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that is going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another person that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want to refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or do they want you to be more pathetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you you know the answer is yes [laughter] I don't know if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just makes me so mad when you talk about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nYou know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with and uh but I've got other folks are like ... so the immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated from the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how that's going to resolve 'cause I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that was Father's Day we can talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also sort of the congregation we find out we were doing a worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they wanted to ask about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling than the number one response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world but\nReconnecting with your

I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors you'll have yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's ... loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President the gutters deeply about whether you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd I said it's a ... not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media\nHow are you\nAllow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you can\nFollow him on passages or some people who we just need to lead have it feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it just it's too satisfying to take the\nMoral high ground and say what you know those people whoever those people are and I need the here\nAnd I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to\nAnd I need to hear and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue it just feels to satisfy the finally letter\nI think that's exactly right I think that's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it\nIt naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nI'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull it averse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do is saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness all these things [noise]\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching I ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to hurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues are typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see this well here's why buffalo people inside it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you and you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side\nI've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon because I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side open my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm you know just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation and who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told\nI was ready to Germany right\nBefore I let you go past or Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how got his wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided in that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told them in our polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place it's are defining value was love so if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation\nWhat hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or a science class of people who disagree with you in a way to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "30"}
