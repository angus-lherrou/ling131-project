confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of this show the people that those you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of this\nAnd um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences\nUm I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life\nAnd what we want government to do ... we\nHad fundamental differences forever in what we believe that but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then he was the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show\nOr not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize it yeah and\nQuite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it\nUm and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nGoing to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of the story over the weekend please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions about what has happened there already\nThe stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions about what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified or walk back so that's common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats are responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue bleed mass referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... beliefs of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement [noise]\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly much nobody wants to talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and she made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nThat wants to not care about our country so much [noise] you know what we should go nationalist and really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a ... it's just someone who put America First um but the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context nationalism knows that and it's a world view embraced on other rising I met has led to\nUm you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself or from a basis that would give them rights that uh we we deem at Central unimportant to human beings um and so a Trump you know\nA space is that would give them rights that uh we we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the term nationalist when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because\nUh the ... the form of nationalism that was most a familiar with a band in the ... community what's that of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and uh even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo see Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I Love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parcel language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his ... secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird will die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth it's right in front of us\nI think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nOne point five cares DC is dedicated to covering southern Colorado and the Rocky Mountain west your membership to directly\nNinety One point five cares DC is dedicated to

conversation with Cassie Adam and Eugene\nUsing this is not the first time the Trump Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts of reality start Caitlyn Jenner published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he is insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow Eugene we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there\nWhat do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just can't you know it's\nBeen really fascinating she uh as I can be one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because\nUh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has\nBeen a fighting for ah the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has to try to be at the table before her um and and the the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps\nA for not a being a a boat advocate or the transgender a community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that one of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that watched\nHow people in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nThat seat back Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beat the communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention and she saw people applaud and so she thought he would have bad algae beat the rights\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beat the rights that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it was just one of those amazing moments about how different Americans hear different things\nWhen it gets to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific synonym for sex centers routinely use to such on birth certificates it seems that we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nCook out take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do was identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself as one more story related to the ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place\nAt the Washington National cathedral shepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the act in October of Nineteen Ninety eight by men who targeted the Twenty one year old University of Wyoming students for being gay\nHis death was a wakeup call for many Americans to violence against el GB teach people to the ceremony drew hundreds to the cathedral for a musical event\nThat included several of shepherds favorite songs including imagine by John Lennon\nLet's get to some more of your comments including about the refugee care of and and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan as a possibility the care of it is real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by way of misspoke when I brought that up\nBryan emailed is this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on our door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by a two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand also on right now is lots of your commenting on this idea of national\nTerry who with which the U.S had a hand also on right now is lots of you were commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there irrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump to use the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American\nAnd Matthew tweeted or mess tweeted equating nationalism was white nationalism seems akin to the right rounding socialism up to ... both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cut for the middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nIt's just that I hate to say that but I don't think he has a plan [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to his base maybe trying to expand as base because the original tax cut that he promised\nI don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out for this election and I\nAsked them how do you see it\nI don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh\nBought them all and I'll Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states this does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happened to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy\nOf people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happen to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy among people trying to make that journey whereas previously they had tried to do it\nIn small groups to try to or not being noticed um that made them vulnerable to all kinds of hazards along the way and so

President Trump sent troops\nTo the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis was authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out to apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping countries like Honduras and El Salvador\nGuatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that\nClearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives in really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nA and have children and have better lives to sensibly and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump in and and I guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out a curve ruined mentioned that President Trump alluded to the ... a A R mentioned\nThat uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there was actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle East and perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of sorts which which\nWe ... we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\nOr that things that the right thank you for the car vacation there but the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and as the um it is extremely dangerous because it it it's a van tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as carbon was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nGoldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to us\nThis quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of use the English language\nMiriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger for persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nBallot could have a hand and drying the new map why midterms matter for redrawing our electoral map that's next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I [noise]\nThe take away today to Lebanon am on Ninety One point five to your cc [noise]\nNow you can have the Ninety One point five cares he's the newsletter highlighting the weeks local and national news delivered to your inbox every Friday morning sign up at ... dot org programming\nOn Ninety One point five K.

O. X. P. O. P. in your store and we'll share some of your stories on Monday\nOn one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post Ravi ... of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast roaming let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex with the prison industrial complex but what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's perhaps because I mean well he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support has a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's there's\nA new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside you if you've noticed reading the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website and we may be tracked your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nFeel it's more juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nWas the voice of lord pain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of a very significant differences between\nFree speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a job in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\n[noise] well that's certainly part of a judge or in in this particular case um [noise] you have a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThere's this guy of Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up a series of of\nUm clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully Andy was\nSexually harassed people and like\nHarvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S [noise] New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these non disclosure agreement so at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else [noise] it\nWas you know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I went [laughter]\nWe appreciate I'd do it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... that the meeting them and it's already been a question is can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male and in player who's pulling things at ... ... ... doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm inclined to able to get away with that it it kind of the perfect and ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting or is it the reputation everyday accused in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k.\nAnd determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how to be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections what Brazilians are focused on uh\nYou know an entire society and and how should it be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections what Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in the second round of voting\nFernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... and most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondent for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nReminders about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nBooker has been a congressman for her a couple of decades now and that's really become a more or less for any particular\nLegislation that are more for me to ... comment and a woman and a minorities and burn and\nGo and and that has given when they're very provocative ... but a lot of people to compare him to come by its own otherwise known as ... ... acres so\nUm it it could have like ... ... come up with an outsider or you're going on around to pretend to be going into a kind of hoping a so called up and put a country back on TALK\nShows why he is so popular I mean you know Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years has just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any social misgivings or maybe about him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "26"}
