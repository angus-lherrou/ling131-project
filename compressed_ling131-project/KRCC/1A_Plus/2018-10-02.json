know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know\nAs a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nOn my own experience can you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had an interesting one another and\nWe drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nRougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise and um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and I think eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that\nExpected it kind of took me by surprise and um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... primary was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager ... is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter fill up the phrase laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nAt my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's going to die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved too in code fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember\nHas specific parts that are evolved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that fit that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the music or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart cuts you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThe kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you were walking through on a house you forget all the decor but that being that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment when she's mia Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments than code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the score ten\nThere are many many ways to work through

I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims\nWhen we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rate that left obvious mar it's easy to

because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I've been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece about it they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about\nAnd know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe embodiment of that injustice and that's that's where I think you know\nAbout and know are in you know the kind of

stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone\nWho feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college

A. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is\nIn a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other sciences I've played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that first showed up on the battlefield was an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know that can is that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nOr the biologist my weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly suited mountaintops and wait for photons too\nCombinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as the person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the can is that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days astronomers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places and so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established\nAnd there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those of you who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one and a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one and you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest\n... owns WAMC which produces one and you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the ... give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people enough humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the U. S. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there was competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets\nSo there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe recall them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had fast forward to today\nSeparated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm

had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement at as well as the pants follow on announcement\nA bit if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will this mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella one sort a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render as ...\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nWith the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on
