NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nScientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors\nIn the process that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that obstacle by growing human retinas unit\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patience it takes between seven months in a year or Eldridge should know she's a graduate student in a lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nExcept for the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every other day [laughter] so they're a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing right now that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an elder written saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things so in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nDon't sense read they don't have these red detecting so\nYou can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't sense read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in the human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first then comes cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these colors and things so called home so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added tirade harm on to their deaths during their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two\nNew goals wanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition it's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnston hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says studies like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these\nStudies show that the similarity is quite high\nEnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature control the development of the retina so

oval office surrounded by reporters and cameras\nWet spoken stream of consciousness fashion about everything from violence in his hometown of Chicago to prison reform to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery to his love\nOf President Trump will give you a taste of what Kanye West pet say\nThere was something about our put his hat off it makes you feel like I'm ready to\nOur favorite superhero\nSuperman is a favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make a complete total sense out of all of this hey how ya hello let's start with the Y y con yeah even there today he\nWas a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump they've been exchanging compliments for a while it it really picked up after World War the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial\nAnd west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat I like Saturday Night live to improve on and on the liberals improve on it if you don't look good\nWe don't look good this is\n[noise] what was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown\nWe know this is\nWhen she was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump's claims that west coming out in support of him has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him okay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today I think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency\nAnd on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priority for none other than Jared Kushner in the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with some of West interest\nUh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues\nShe's been to the White House on two occasions and she's successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time ... what was the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nAllowed what he seemed to talk about publicly was that about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago game gangster disciples who is now in the supermax prison serving multiple life than it is\nA this was the case that is different from usually the case of that prison at Purdue reform advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh\nWho have committed non violent offenses and ah who maybe got really extreme sentences\nUm but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for western shop All right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I think you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nOne voter in a poor health research she's doing well under President Trump\nThis is NPR News one voter in a poor Kentucky ... says she is doing well under President Trump but she says those still in poverty should work their way\nAll right That's NPR's Debbie Elliott in Panama City Florida thank you daddy You're welcome\nTo another story now millions of Americans post our ancestry information online new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in on relatives who may have committed a crime NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect for a series of brutal rapes and murders in California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nHas a goal to think Heller finally been captured California investigators in Jeddah match dot com to name just has changed the Angelo as a setback genealogy west side to try to identify the tourists homes they killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in that debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of these reality it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousin once removed in the debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS you than you there's multiple that's I like to find a location\nWhen the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in\nTo find a location and when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological record you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify are supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals of these techniques but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to MIT\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift do DNA behind a wheel K with foreign governments are going to exploited these techniques\nDo identify you do for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen grey tech works at ... labs which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades\nThey're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific in murders of children\nThings like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings figure getting cut and for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News\nMake sure it is an misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West to met for lunch today one topic on the agenda gun violence in Chicago west told Trump he opposes stop and frisk police tactics\nThe president's ideas have differed greatly from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nA different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nFew years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some butter gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nMy of director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on a straighten it out says there's no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out opposition the administrator\nAnd is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk and works and it was meant for problems\nLike [noise] Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says\nThe widespread stopping and for skiing and potential criminals\n[noise] Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk [noise] from says\nThe widespread stop and frisk getting a potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forums justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stopped\nThe administration believes that sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in\nOnly really hadn't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they uh get knocked and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards that consent decree as necessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word as just as you move to stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nI mean if we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ab loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nDay when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew it'll lives those were the words from soaked in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian lawyer you rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station sales during and today\nThat lift off had proceeded to leave for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] up\nHere and I I mean it's like five of them\nThe crew American the tank and Russian Alexei ... in in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're return home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nSo this was going to the American Nick hate first time into these ... seconds for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched\nWorking together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know the the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely doctor\nWhen would be the next you know you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to his base today you know a kind of\nGosh all that preparation would at the ... but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again very bottom I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out\nThere are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there is a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but\nIf they on talking to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough shift that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it unmanned\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it it's going to be a really complicated decision making process\nComing up Chris Hadfield when the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today nice to talk of the aisle so thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nOne voter in a poor ... says she is doing well under President Trump but she says those still in poverty should work their way

investigators saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting 'cause she'll get that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it\nThat Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference that almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks so much for having me and my pleasure\nShadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about Saudi journalist and

was the Bush administration's ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the September eleventh attacks and he says in times like this it's crucial to have an ambassador then when he was appointed by

fact that it is likely they are not telling the truth about what happened to Jamal ... why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside Yemen\nJordan the former
