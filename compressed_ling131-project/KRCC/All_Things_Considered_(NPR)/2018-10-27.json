auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here too yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck print workplace\nPolicies ... see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes prove it everything\nSo you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs\nA little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThat after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGrew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really gonna be 'cause they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ...\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they\nHave a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago Mike ... son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me a cycle hay bale here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting\nIt was like a tease really you know like I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAnd just say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPain has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal

night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in ...\nAnd the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house because we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them and they're on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and I think he's so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Dave Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and now let's say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of estate me and for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaved and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit there was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at a state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion as controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big theme is playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can say that name enough\nWho will spend and recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous\nAnd apple fight on television and hopes to\nTo undermine you well one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has to attract an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaign and the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott while I was never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and\nAnd turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent\nBut just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself is under assault\nAnd I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together as money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half a million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business\nFrom getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want\nYou know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district dental X\nAsian with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district done extensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that's how the candidate votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump\nIn your campaign is\nHe's huge I mean I I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone still\nHe's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging he\nGoes around the country saying vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher in a presidential election\nAnd the reality is this is the first chance that voters in this district and everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing and the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things that got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about\nThat well Scott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about a letter the million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative aspects of it and what about\nThe Trump factor we talked about that is is is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about they might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country\nTalk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about the might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrats got while it is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick fitzpatrick is a former FBI agent the only form of FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian either [noise]\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\n[noise] uh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in his suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers recovered an assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions that case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement before today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhether the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off us attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime\nInvestigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges in this case he says that there's no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nCould just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used in in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there uh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts for reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments\nA and the alleged shooter in this case is of course alive and in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat if NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity\nBlue Cross Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity and that is a message that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics facts and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Thompson and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty six team in previous years before that was very politically involved those vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the oil\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who've been calling for something like this lawyer John ... in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same argument on average I toss ritual venue former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car and came up with a structure for that ... what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no like really\nI um I have always done a pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive\nI never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that\nRealizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just on a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish I was hoping that we could come to\nDid you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish I was hoping\nThat we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue odor but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the blind men and the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with Philip ... book\nExpert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo darned see not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people meeting ... but um [laughter] what you want is I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decide to come well it where it", "year": "2018",
