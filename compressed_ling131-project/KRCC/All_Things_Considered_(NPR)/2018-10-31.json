Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nIn an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at a campaign rally\nSims is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days well the president has definitely been talking a lot about\nImmigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities that is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nHigh it's Cairo's though the host of marketplace you might have known or maybe didn't before I worked in radio I flew planes in the United states and if those were seriously sophisticated machine but they actually one thing or radio that could pulling NPR I Can't tell you what I Would have given to hear wait wait don't tell me on an aircraft\nCarrier if you're listening to your favorite shows in your own machine\nWhen the time comes ... decision they'll turn it into the programs you love [noise] gr donation information at your C.

vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women or ...\nNext Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party or ... started Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women\nEnergized we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how do we do this to go around and he hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos income is reading about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well but once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think trust by the women's march [laughter]\nThis is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWhat\nWhy why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important to black woman\nWhy why are\nWe and that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that black women had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that is actually missing urgency there's nothing to do\nI answer Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nGet relationships in the middle of it because I was in the police and the other police officers say something\nLife will he fits the profile\nMy dad is six to my brother's history\nThere are all star game\nWe use\nEvery man in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nTake us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort\n... I think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC on directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and\nNot to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman

might have looked at as a a disadvantage and that's the thing you felt like you had to turn into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office I left school\nNot because I didn't know the value of an education but because my mother got sick and she lost her job and I was her caregiver\nIn battling that pre existing condition of leukemia which ultimately took her life that is a story that millions of Americans can relate to\nAnd we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people is because people are not at the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia rates I Need to become the first black female governor there's one to Coleman running for Congress in North Carolina why now it's been many many years where there haven't been that many women of color running what do you think is different\nWell to be clear even though we have an ad that leadership parity and gender and race black woman had been a leading\nMany women of color running what do you think it's different\nWell to be clear even though we have an ad that leadership parity in gender and race black woman had been leading in faith communities in social racial gender and economic justice movements we've been on the frontlines we've proven that our votes matter that our voices matter\nAnd now we're proving that our leadership matters the polls that is down by Thirteen points and we won by Seventeen\nBecause we expanded the electorate and ultimately you can't poll transformation and that is what is a foot in this country right now but you can't vote for the

early cervical cancer\nWe decided to stop offering them minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and are completely convert to the open approach\nWhat's causing this is a bit of a mystery Ramirez says

survive it still there were tons of mess and misinformation floating around\nThat people who eat a lot of tomatoes will give us a fever or people who eat too much free will get yellow fever\nAnd other widespread myth that you couldn't get yellow fever if he weren't black Allah various says prominent doctors spread the lie that black people were naturally immune to the disease and she says that lie was used to justify slavery\nIf black people are naturally resistant to yellow fever therefore black slavery\nIs natural even humanitarian because it protects white people from spaces and labor that were killed them\nBut here's the thing even if they didn't want to admit it many people knew that black folks weren't immune at flea markets few people were willing to buy a person who was an already

in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a

Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by\nSlapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means that the United states\nWe are the economic and the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven

buying dollar right\nAnd so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us ...\nThere's for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheap for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something

unprecedented lists that are you are but as far as going to do with from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the blacklist about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud long went to his bank she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face\nLike up on a big billboard\nOr another in more than be electric ... by the side of the plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures on that screen it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town she says whenever he went out\nWhenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that she saw the face of someone he knew\nOr a lot of money there and done with all of our\nOwn garden this or we should be working with him in the same industry as I did it all now up there\nOh my God these wars and we have to be working with him in the same industry as I did oh no I'm their\nLoved ones started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to you started getting people together meeting up for dinner she says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nSo what I thought what don't you know I was actually a friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant and people will think why are you sure been happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud bond says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this and by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says he will keep paying off his debts she has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport for Planet
