artificial intelligence\nIt's called the portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel Just shop where he literally took and then you're in oil and hang it on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what art actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is\nShattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really [noise]\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the code hers who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a canvas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited

Kandahar\nThe attack also kills Kandahar is intelligence chief a dull moment and wounded governor Zalmay we saw initial reports from Afghan officials said the governor was killed\nIn American

like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I've heard a lot of kids are where it goes that's when problems can definitely happen and an overdose can definitely be reality\nI think it's good to make and arcane available\nBut it's really tricky situation this student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions they didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school\nBut I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was\nIt was pretty bad now one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago\nHis school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe con to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them is if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in

can for them to you\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student was planning on studying for their exam that having had no testing strips and their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and try it out\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even

yet\nAnd and the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all

of artist you using a different vocal modifications but it always been a disguise you used it in ways that you would hope the audience wouldn't notice just to make of a vocal a little cleaner and clearer and more on pitch\nThis song brings the auto tune front and center here those modification\n\nAnd it could easily have just been a gimmick instead auto tune became a very prominent tool in a lot of pop R. and B and hip hop production\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your shearing a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nIn a in a way that doesn't sound natural but auto tune can amplify an expression of passion is in or emotion in a singer\nWas me I think of a song like hide and seek by the singer image and heat or who became really really well known for for using this affect the uh\nTo a song like hide and seek by the singer image and he uh who became really really well known for for using this affect the a and you hear hide and seek and the way they're using auto tune to manipulate her voice\nYou really feel the emotions that that song is expressing and I don't know too many people would hear that song and take a auto tune\nHe he\nWatches eh so what you've seen in the years since his auto tune being used in kind of exciting an innovative ways and it can be misused\nIn ways that can leach into the motion and love out of a out of a performance like the black eyed peas have a lot of these like a very uh over driven party hearty sounds and I would I Would describe their sound as like the music robots make when they're trying to sell products to other robot\nGotta get get gotta get there\nSo it's sort of amazing that all of this auto tune stuff really began in the pop music landscape with this one dance pop song from almost exactly Twenty years ago when that song originally came out all the people involved with that song actually tried to hide from the public\nThe methods they used to create that song because

nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's journal and hang it on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really [noise]\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is all are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so\nI think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the
