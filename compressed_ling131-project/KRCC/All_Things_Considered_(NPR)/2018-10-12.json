what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation do we even know what they talked about today I think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency\nAnd on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focus there's some overlap with some of West interests\nUh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she's successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drug than what\nWas the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nAllowed what he seemed to talk about publicly was that a about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in the supermax

by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales to produce jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American another\nFacet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much thanks matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed is gone crazy I think\nThe fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also [noise]\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve run for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nPleasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy that maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nUp until now fed officials happened defending said from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always in the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing\nBased on economic analysis using information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing that it is a deliberate nonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests\nBut you're a little concerned that maybe comes right it could be affecting that trust among the ...\nThat he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome thank you for having me on [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMad Men creator Matthew Weiner is back with a new series for Amazon called the Romanoff is it is an anthology series

these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded

men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why really ... him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nCharged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nPresident ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nAnd they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment the ...\nCase that we've been tracking all of us this week\nTo Jim ... case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nTrail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures and fall and twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nAre mystery why\nAnd that money and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag a free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures and fall and twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find\nThings I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we've received in product costs for manufacturers so present with a wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to\nCarolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with wealth food prices\nKill is much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets amid analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nYou think about a soft drink companies [noise] ah no one\nBut they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminium suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbout companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now still up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nTracking your cat agree on line many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power or\nIn other words the power to raise prices until they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat with NPR White

internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nActions but what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers that's right the indictments against you argue officers of seven were announced\nOn there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers that's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the mall or investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents garden Ira thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing

that's right the athletic Rand Paul Knight is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and a quarter and yoga broker after two years and so they put out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball though with the elements of cultures\nDid you hear all about this come back we're going to go into ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been like Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter\nAnd that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal\nWith tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any new comer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes less model okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to bind okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old are in the end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that you know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think\nOne thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever [laughter] and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and man made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of ...\nSo many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that

ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the steps in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights audience ... things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's why this huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be used push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes them I'd sneak start

early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report that summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld with accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nI I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you ...\nIt's actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every\nSingle one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat would expect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nKnow what your offices report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly inconsistent\nYou didn't know what your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse

this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world\nConstantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to\nOr how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement\nPlays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh Shapiro

ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws when they succeeded which was the first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go

might send an impeachment referrals to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the Watergate special that was very interesting but what I asked you to load math was set up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringement ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the Silk Road or

these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here so [noise] so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry shouldn't often for his displeasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve\nUsual is it for the president to be packing the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its minister ration often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nUp until now fed officials happened defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think that the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and held sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using\nThe institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve\nInformation using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of Kevin ... thank you so much
