joining us here on all things considered thank you I glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the contests\nSigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us or on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding their breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of that agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S and some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase\nThe and the United states address that before the final ISIS agreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry or not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is is it worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrators cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of a motoring equipment Manufacturers

year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after large collusion knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from [noise]\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we were looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence

amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to chess where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth's vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from\nFor example the creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event in its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet

them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you felt that this farm did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email but nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is a central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases blacking out I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blacking out phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one oh\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nI don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to a what I Know about making eighty three and maybe forty five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense\n... investigation from your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about new three maybe four to eighty five or you know college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they'd been a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\nI'm going to\n...\n...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign what a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand and that doesn't mean that everyone who wants war will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from within\nBecause it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to tape work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nIt makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money thanks ought to pleasure Ari thanks\n[noise] the\nFor Planet Money comes from transfer wise\nTo get

were given a clearly the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that do I'm a doctor forward and Mr ... gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou should be up there it was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told to be and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation and get a gal that allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and ... and what we do know about um situations like this where someone has a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that how traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later\nNorth bound by twenty five is still closed that sells academy because of um a fatal

Department today she is most days and she is back here in the studio now with details you carry I'm Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now what's the timing yeah the defendants are set in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering\nA few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are\nIn Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen\nThat the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did in sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched this cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes were of eating drug test\nEmbarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself now\nMary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian\nIs that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's

announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment\nThey parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year says the Sergei Skripal ... exactly I mean\nHere's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against the credit ... servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question may but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually have warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be falter misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive at the Russian government allegedly did in this case\nNPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of

tourist spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows let's call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat his rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nTo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you've been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at\nI think in any

confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed [noise]\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event in the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable

removed from the state constitution and put into the state statute\nI'm Still a little confused of the differences in constitutional versus those that you\nIt's a complicated issue to unpack for starters laws in this state statute aren't as powerful as those written into the constitution\nAt first blush I think it could appear as if we're trying to make it legal yeah\nThat's democratic state senators the sundberg he's a primary sponsor of amendment acts\nOr by no means doing that in fact there's a chance that if we don't do this or the law could conflict in a way that it actually makes it through our industry kind of hers\nIn two thousand twelve Colorado became one of the first state to legalize it was written into the constitution that industrial hemp cannot contain more than twenty three percent ... see\nThat's the same stuff in marijuana it's cousin plant that gets you high but recently the federal government has gotten serious about national legalization that summer the U.S Senate introduced a bill and it could have a different definition of industrial hemp than what's in our constitution\n... the executive director of the Colorado have Industries Association she says that would be a major setback\nSo it's really good public policy to actually move it from the constitution and put it someplace where it can be modified\nLaws and the statute can be changed by a state
