East Point they are the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise said tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds you know the there I think it was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd they are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region\nIn this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under watched him and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from\nBy tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there I'm Mary Louise so where am I mean why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nPresident ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation and they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering\nStudy the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted\nBut will for instance a Washington continue

Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes Fritos in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there\nWas a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime to our\nValued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices\nSo presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is in things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies aluminum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbout companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now is tails up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now\n[noise]\n\n...

exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays the potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this lock come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this life gets proportionally affecting minority voters how have they made

[noise] what are you about Twenty years old [noise] eighty eight years of my God I think of candies in my purse [laughter] and\nSarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us and we're on the air [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much yeah but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a pimp there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said never on the clock though you know never want while I'm actually on the ...\nUp who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never up while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth and value are determined by\nAppearance in my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags\nYou know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have begun smelled on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\n... can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends\nBe comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is ... so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said\nBut he good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter]\nVersions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white and you this that and yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which it's all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us",
