starting right here on earth in fact it is there like literally dirt that is what astrophysicist Adam Frank says and I'm going to let him explain\nAnd by dirt I mean soil is always around to remind us that the world is one giant interconnected Claude of a wonder\nSee if you can just open your science eyes when you look at a handful of soil suddenly you're going to see not just dirt but as seamless an essential network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand than there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see it was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play and like a box full of different sizes balls there are a lot of gas and pathways between those clumps\nThat's where the microbes live and they use those gaps to full advantage turning the soil into both hyper complicated network of subway tunnels and the churning chemical reactor\nIt's this chemistry party in a sponge architecture that makes soil the foundation for all the rest of life around you\nSee those busy microbes metabolizing along and they're tunnels or what led soil filter rainwater keeping it clean for us to drink and the elements in the rocks and clay that helped the microbes move nutrients around to underground roots living acorns turned into giant oaks and wheat seeds turn into the bread you ate for lunch\nIt's not the microbes alone that work these miracles and it's not the minerals enclaves by themselves that let acorns become oaks soils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric with Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forums\nCome oaks soils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric with Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forms over to the living and back to the non living again\nThrough soils we can see how our bodies and our lives are also a tightly woven tapestry of living and non living world it's not just us over here in the world over there each of us as part of the cosmic fabric of matter energy and change who strands can never be separated\nEach of us is an ongoing expression of this earth and we were born to each of us as an expression\nOf its dirt and that is a

oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar

your ability to open up your store or your restaurant or or your business\nSeem a famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one

stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about ... what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand is that usually raises rates to stave off inflation right around their fears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong\nChair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bowl marketing stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool Tibet as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the sell\nOff for virtually all sectors of the market sold off today wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day but it is just the beginning of along down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens let's say that NPR's John Ydstie

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ...\nIs as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group\nAnd it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I ... did they warn ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris year source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I\nThink there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership and Saudi Arabia and\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there's a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my place\n... on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hope for the weekend or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon penny Nance the c._e._o. of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed in a very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKevin is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she said that many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation that have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this\nCourt those efforts will now be supersized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest we know that we're going to need an ironclad nets\nExpecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network estates and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the midterm elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November that that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nNamed Raul is also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B.

Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gusts of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina at some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you hold trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate moving on to\nHim or without where to go\nTo Gary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment and has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owner is giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash for more says that won't go far\n... and they noticed over the age I Love to go to a movie with all of able to do it at all I\nWant to throw more his girlfriend's terrorists who king sits in a chair by the front door her head in her hands on stressed out\nThe red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back schools the sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nClosed during a hurricane we actually opened back up that too\nWe'd like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during the hurricane we actually opened back up\nTo date for the public after the hurricane um but\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening a new kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown of Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business\nI came in for a few days to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the\nWork environment or what's going to happen\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming small businesses\nAre especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless a business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering because you've lost that\nYou know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced me can't get them back\nSo it delays your ability to open up your store or your restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disprove that prediction but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes
