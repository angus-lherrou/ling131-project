Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party and he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years palm Marines says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd Don ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write\nThis piece after Christie bossy Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her paintings off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nThis was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nTen like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates that we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk\nAnd you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy\nThings and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't say I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it will happen now and he said everybody\nIn the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it\nThat's what they told me but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that\nShe wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film you say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest you know kind of have\nMixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it\nAnd then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people\nSome women have said it's about time someone it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this and a lot of women are said uh they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help these women then but I didn't do it dump hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adam's\nApple [laughter]\nCould Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later could Ruth was sentenced to
