I Would say over two hundred and forty five a number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've\nReached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't vote with the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them but what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father ...\nAbout stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over if I'm killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow somebody whose parents to return to the U.S and reunite fee but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent is a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way

keeping the fact checkers busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way through Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country than Tom not letting them in\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already out of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nTo third on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... has not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but what we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nSince things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the role\nSome cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act and be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the

commercially produced pollen supplements on the market which the bees will collect and store as Paul and\nThere was major drought from two thousand two can you compare this year to then\nThis year is significantly better although not good but from the drought we had then we lost an awful lot of our feral colonies in we judge that by the number of swarms we collect prior to that we would collect
