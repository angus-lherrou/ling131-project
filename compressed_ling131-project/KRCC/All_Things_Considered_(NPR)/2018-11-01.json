more likely to think that gains for women are losses for men and so conservative women are more likely to think that maybe men in their life are going to be hurt by the me too movement or change

brave of them to come forward\nOn the question of false allegations are poll shows Seventy seven percent of Republicans believe their common but most Democrats disagree\nThose talking points are being used to discredit women and to weaponize this issue to simply for partisan gang attorney Deborah Katz says she ran straight into it when she represented Kavanaugh's accuser Dr Christie bloody Ford we

with time the NPR Ipsos poll does show much more consensus among young people\nFewer of those under thirty five believe that me too has gone too far fewer say they would ever consider voting for a

really striking Ari [noise]\nIt was in the middle of a fjord snow capped mountains and they were what they were trying to do is to get vehicles on shore to support thousands of troops in war games uh south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain and Norway oil and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline you\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nYou can't ignore the contact NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more and its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia and earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength that I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with impunity so we may be challenged and so ah if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nTo what ... saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been from about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nCertainly
