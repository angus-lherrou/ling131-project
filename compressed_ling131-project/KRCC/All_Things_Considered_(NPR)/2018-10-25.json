region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide but eight rural mountains\nChan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to his little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know picked up by your bootstraps mentality and Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home because my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talked to a dog\nAbout the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAnd she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in rates [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school\nEighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to roll\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nHow a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to hers and the crowded wall\nSupporting them and positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down in like help them be positive and just the point that in the what they're going through so they don't feel like giving\nLily has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength could eat with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's got to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing\nWhat's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this was going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there's so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like schools husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super\nPowerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movements and changing social norms and changing things that need to change\nKids are catalysts to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the community will follow Kirk Siegler NPR News Grand Junction Colorado\n\n\nAnd tomorrow on MORNING edition or how the killing of Saudi journalist ... ... is being talked about in a wrong NPR's new well you know your caller to the leadership in Tehran\nAbout the Iranian President claim that the Saudis killed the journalist with protection from the you you can hear that conversation tomorrow on MORNING edition by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name\nTune in for MORNING EDITION tomorrow five to nine AM here on Ninety One point five ... see [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThis is a big struggle going on in this small town right now in rural America disdain for the federal government can run high with the midterms approaching and NPR poll shows that many residents actually want government help but is there enough to go around\nFrom ... well President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala\nHonduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America shouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on foreign\nRelations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course is precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations that goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fix\nTraining programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each\nCountry in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nNot just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nYou know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on\nAnd it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain it may have been under estimate it a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions what\nKind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and do some bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the word that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and cleared than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to this\nFor the most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDon't conduct says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists a neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd do some ... says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... brother editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved in cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task what\nWe now understand is that what Sarah but um does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but\nWhen it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\n... says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News

US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the\nImmigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we are talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so\nThe so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we are talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president's incidents\n[noise] well I I I I Know they'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I tour to be thrown in ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was the network that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this or that I've had I I Do not have any specific evidence in this caravan but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were\nSome effect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me play you already said\nDemocrats [noise] want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy\nSanta for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again what I've read about is this a curtain ... people are opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of why I brought a strip of homeland security most of these laws aren't under my major's diction we've got it or to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is this year he was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues adapt their agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather the information find areas of agreement in our community ... you know we all agree on a secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and attorneys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its feel competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's

cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd al ... an ad that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David\nBrought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office That's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you ...\nBack in Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear where they um we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not all the advent Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the ... costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like white people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these characters linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American pie and think of ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against that\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWell the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to ... back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense none of this\nBut do you make of that [noise] [noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white paint over to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen\nThank you so much Mary Louise scenic like silver [laughter]\nI felt [noise] this is NPR News\nThere is an oil boom in ... in Texas it's one of the most competitive congressional districts in the country how politics are playing in the oil field\n... well President Trump has\nThreatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your\nArgument so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern trying all nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nKnow each country in the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador in their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us\nTo try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just the AIDS the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we are big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational\nIn nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nYou know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\nRepublican congressman Doug Lamborn has represented Colorado's fifth congressional district since two thousand seven\nIn his bid for reelection this year he's facing a challenge from Democrats stephany rose Spaulding we heard from spoiling yesterday and today we hear from when board about why he's running and what he hopes to accomplish if reelected you spoke by phone with buddy one point five here she sees Jake\nBernal why are you running for reelection in the ... congressional district\nShould I be fortunate enough to be reelected there are some things I really want to go back to Washington and work on\nStrict should I be fortunate enough\nTo be reelected there are some things I really want to go back to Washington and work on I've been working on but we're not done yet I really want to make sure that the economy\nComes out even stronger\nThan before under Donald Trump and with the tax cuts that we've done the economy is just really booming right now and getting stronger and stronger we gotta keep up this economic growth I'd say that that's number one number two is strengthening\nOur military and as you know among the armed Services Committee and I have a senior position on that committee and that's a real opportunity for me to make sure that the\nMilitary as properly funded you know we have such a strong defense presence here in the ... congressional district in Colorado we we have a lot going on and I've been so involved in that\nBut the jobs not done yet and then I guess last Lee my third priority would be to help Donald Trump with immigration\nYou know we have a a border situation that's really not where it should be and I in a way I Know why people want to come to America um it's the land of opportunity but we have to have a reasonable and rational\nImmigration policy and we have to have some\nEffective border security as well\nSo you mentioned the economy and the tax cuts one aspect of that that you didn't mention is the deficit you know the congressional budget office has said that the tax cut bill has already increase the deficit and this most recent fiscal year are you concerned about that and and what do you think needs to be done\nJake I'm absolutely concerned about that and and we all should be concerned about it now let me say this the best long term solution\nWhich is getting spending under control and entitlements under control but we have to have growth as a country the better gross we have as a country the easier it is to pay our debts\nAnother issue that you've been involved with is the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act you've supported that in the past what are your thoughts on that issue at the moment obviously efforts to repeal the Affordable CARE Act to fail do you think it's time to move on from that issue\nWould still like to a repeal of Obamacare now we did repeal the individual mandate and that was a good thing the Republican plans did address ...\nNow we did repeal the individual mandate and that was a good thing the Republican plans did address preexisting conditions and I think did so in a very clear sided and honest way by addressing people who have\nPre existing conditions as opposed to the Obamacare remedy which was to raise expenses for everybody require them to have insurance whether they wanted it or not or whether that was the best for them or not and then\nWhen everyone was covered that would also include preexisting condition let's address a pre existing conditions but make sure that everyone has the freedom and flexibility to do what's best for them and they have a lot of different options available\nYou've counted the fact that you're one of the most conservative members of Congress how do you square that with the need as a representative to represent all members of your constituency including Democrats and independents\nYeah great question Jake One thing that I Do for everyone in my district is to make sure that if they need a service from the government we will go to bat for them and we don't ask what their\nRegistration is we don't even ask if they're registered to vote we say if you're a member of this community of constituents of the district we will help you know when it comes to philosophy\nI'm not going to be able to have a philosophy that everyone agrees that in fact we kind of unfortunately have a polarized country in many respects right now and so you know there's a lot of stress and ... and ... over a politics right now\nAnd you can't make everyone happy I learned a long time ago you just can't make you happy so you have to be true to what you believe put it out there and see if the voters agree with that and if so you have to live up to what you said you would do and I've tried my best to do that\nThat was Ninety One point five ... speaking with congressman
