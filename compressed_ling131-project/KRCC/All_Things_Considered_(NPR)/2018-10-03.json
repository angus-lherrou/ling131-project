raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen but because Trump hasn't\nReleased his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is

Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many don't want to and today in the\nWhite House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine bloody\nThe week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey\nFord Motor just motor users can do as a woman now he\nSeemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night right\nWell they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nNPR on Ninety One point five to your cc is supported locally by forty five degree

Mexico and Canada ends months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts here in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well entered after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties are able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the green that will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nTurns into the Green Belt will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalize this agreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states prospective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U. S. content and for some of our suppliers in some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles\nTo biggest concern our members are going to have the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward the agreement\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor on equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nAnd he was a pleasure\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today thank you it's a pleasure\n\nCommunities across the country are grappling with a new kind of chemical pollution in drinking water it's called pee fast\nA group of thousands of chemicals used for decades and products like ... pans designs and regulation around that still aren't settled leading some people in limbo New Hampshire Public Radio's Annie Ropeik has the story [noise]\nJulian lanes family built a house in a tree lined cul de sac in the New Hampshire town of green on a recent morning as she wrangled her young daughter is a door she pointed at a picture window for the woods in the backyard\nSo as to what\nIt is a federal Superfund site called Coakley landfill lane didn't even know it was there until two years ago when she heard of an nightmarish discovery nearby a cancer cluster of young kids all with the same rare deadly diagnoses lane was desperate to know for girls were risk so she started reading\nUnderneath one of the articles was just a comment from a Public Citizen that set a Coakley question mark and I was like ... the heck is ... so I started Googling it\nShe found a former town dumb but turned toxic waste cleanup area just through the woods and the ... case [noise]\nBob solving the city attorneys nearby Portsmouth he says the landfill now a huge grassy hill used to be an empty Corey\nAnd that was actually kind of stayed in the back in the Nineteen seventies when people looking to get rid of municipal waste a\nThey would find a hole in somewhere and fill it up [noise] public seemed like a good idea\nHeavy metals and manmade toxins were seeping from a landfill into neighbors' water wells\nCoakley shut down and became a Superfund site in the mid eighties it was covered with a kept keep brain from washing out more Thompson's\nFor years this put the public fears to rest then amid news of the cancer cluster and twenty sixteen workers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill\nSince then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but ... chemicals\nCan pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but peace has chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer so neighbors like Jillian lane are still terrified\nRight and so were drinking the water and were bathing in it were brush her teeth in it and we have no idea that we're living with this potential\nProblem lanes family spent thousands of dollars on high tech water filters and she devoted countless hours to public meetings and petitions for more clean up an aid\nThe environmental protection agency says the ... in nearby wells is not a threat based on state and federal standards but that doesn't quite line up with a June report from the Centers for Disease Control it says pee fast may threatened human health at levels ten times lower than what the EPA and states like New Hampshire advice\nAt a recent federal meeting on ...

Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor also now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even have a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important in it that these miners are very well taken care of I don't believe that ... they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds couldn't find any child in our care for any parent\nHGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da chest said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAt Central database did the inspector general fine that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids\nAt all then what happened to the family\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no risk bans and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more

them had a common thread of the one person I have never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry the someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but

ten\nI just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right

to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to need three years ago five years ago

that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me or\nThe New York times story you gets hurt in that sense that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nIs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so real estate companies\nSuch as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lack the resources to police tax fraud\nPace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades to simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resource as they are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions allowing the term family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extended the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it NYU's Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because\nOf the statute of limitations but severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force

Alan ... and Susan Davies what's Colorado Springs trails and open space collusion about how motor list morning changes the experience that Governor the gods and how it could help change the city's cycling culture\nThis is our day this is our day when it's the ... and as bicyclists you know we get to go in and experience the quiet the way the folks that found the park and the first place what it must have been like when it was so quiet and and so beautiful and it was just you and the rocks that sort of what this day is like\nWe were out there at the crack of dawn and it was quite cold because of the sun was coming up over balance struck when we stopped\nIt was super quiet and all you could hear where the birds and I can't say that I've ever been in charge of the gods when I've been able to just literally here the wildlife and the natural sounds of the garden [noise] um it's such a protected area was just it was quite beautiful\nIt seemed like this is a pretty bike friendly hiker friendly walked friendly community do you feel like it is or know\nDepending on where you live in town your version of what bike friendly\nLooks and feels like can be radically different we are almost two hundred square miles and that lends itself well to connecting some great trails but it also lends itself to having to retrofit some of the newer developments in Twenty years is what I'm considering new so\nTrying to connect those up and trying to put bike lanes in or trying to do drill connections can be slow work but as we move forward we're becoming more bike friendly as a city\nAnd the good news is we have excellent examples nearby Fort Collins spent some time in Fort Collins take your bike up to Fort Collins and see how seamlessly you can ride between the trail and roads system and you'll realize why that is now a platinum bike friendly city whereas we're silver\nYou know we're Olympic city usa and were settling for solver excuse me but there are certainly cities that are embracing bicycling and making it more bike friendly because they know it draws tourists now we have a slice of the population that probably would be happy if tourism went down\nAnd I don't understand that at the same time it is what it is you know we have an amazing park and trail system that minutes away from our downtown that's pretty unique we're going to draw the tourists the best we can do\nIs try to teach them how to responsibly use our trails use good trail advocate and wherever possible expand those trails and expand those those\nDo is try to teach them how to responsibly use our trails use good trail advocate and wherever possible expand those trails and expand those those areas of open space so that that people don't\nFeel too crowded how far off do you think that platinum top tier writing would be for Colorado Springs time wise mentality wise is it possible we've got to change our culture it's not just changing the roads it's not just finding\nMore money we've got to convince people that if you make room for bicycles we're not taking something from you if anything were taking a car off the road and making your commute in the car easier I think it's years away that's my my idea\nThat cultural change we talked to people that have been here since the seventies where the cat to be it was a dirt road and there's been so much change that's happened so quickly and so now we're trying to in a sense force even more change but\nIt's really about choices and it's about allowing residents to have choices in the way they move through the community and not always just have to be in a car\nIt's creating that environment to where people can ride from their house to a park with their kids in the weekend to be able to ride to the library to be able to have kids ride to school again\nDo you think that motor less morning as a step in the right direction towards changing that culture no\nNot even close it's it's a nice thing to do but that's not going to create the culture on the east side of our tone or in the far flung reaches of Colorado Springs\nUs promoting how you can get to Motorola morning easily by bicycle from your neighborhood\nOr you're not having to drive to garden of the gods and helping to inspire and educate people on who you can get there from way out on the east side of like from powers all using the rock island trail and the legacy leap you can connect them and never really have to be on a road wants to get to go to the gods that's pretty amazing\nI think Motorola this day and gone to the gods can bring a family out there who have an amazing experience\nAnd then a week later when mom and dad say so do you want to do today chances are let's go for a bike ride it can be the spark it can it
