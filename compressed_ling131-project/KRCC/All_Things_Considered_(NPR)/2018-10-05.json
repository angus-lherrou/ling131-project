he needs to be confirmed in a\nFinal vote tomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy floor speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\nIs the presumption of innocence and fairness\nTo bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThen for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believed the charges against Kavanaugh should not prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her conclusion\nPresident I Will vote chicken for jazz cats\nPrime court her conclusion Mr President\nI Will vote chickens for judge Kavanaugh\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee

this is essentially they have the fifty one votes the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen between now and that it happened you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and that means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role but he might have had to play how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins she laid out her position and links for speech has already said uh didn't appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument did was as much that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not that extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her

verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the clown McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what does the reaction\nWell because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge that that's something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades fell I think those activists feeling like a mom and a fellow ration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it wasn't for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he inscribed with chronic Donald

as blank um he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can shape looking at the dashcam video of this incident so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this for to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that 'cause I think that the tension here had been more about more than just looks on\nDonald you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there is another trial would lead it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA a problem that the community feels but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'd be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on finger at night who encountered the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that wasn't going to a lot of folks at that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police

story of a veteran trying to find dish ... when I decided I was going to show that sewing machine and I was like I'm gonna do it right now and I literally just shake my head\nAnd my writing thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow but it is now looking increasingly likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there hey I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and short typically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs into the room and then you should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said the questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to\nBar who know him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as family that he would have acted like an all time to time I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because they truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me\nOutstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForeign sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously Ruth Bader Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific were marketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after break he apologized to send her a ... a for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that [noise]\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota John Malcolm thank you\n... inch to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you it's good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation
