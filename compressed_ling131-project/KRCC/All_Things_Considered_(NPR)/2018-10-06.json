to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge\nThis is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nTo convict a police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described it look comic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um he said that the climate Donald raised a knife to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this incident so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tensions here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there's another trial of laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA problem that the community feels

what happens in that trial and have a C react to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who account on

important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nAs and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats for showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as a new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits we decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nName is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at ... Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film at center since it opened a about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel ball\nAnd for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck\nI Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it center since it opened um about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her morale roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel ball\nAnd for me this means more sports equipment more opportunity to go to tournaments that kinda thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now than the way the two years for my stocks to us\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at a facility that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five\nAn hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh it's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\n... ... for the last three weeks I wars in the ... century Miami I started working in a store is a process that goes I mean you receive merchandise [noise]\nTo bring the inventory on his farm raising them and do this for hours and no injuries were going to be making freezing dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it because the writer I Know it can be to my farm in or better quality and all sorts of string more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for ... full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to read some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with\nFifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work air which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of them believe that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you can hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you\nWere before so I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nIdea why why why do they now so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been at state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nLevel was happening for quite some

the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming release um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing the shots\nWeapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing those shots and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in fact the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case\nThat we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is its consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promises in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here\n[laughter] ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a
