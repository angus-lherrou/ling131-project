Brewster thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that\nYou had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nCan can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects of\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these are not the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this was to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders\nFor dependent visas not the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.

Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager at local McDonalds\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers Terence ... died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nAnd violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers gets up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about that so we've contacted Maria had her ... she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us [noise]\nThank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off ... says investors said there's something of says\nSo from my perspective it's really want that either they'll send a wind this police officers were killed in the line of duty you know\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty you know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turned that\nWe are seeing that is dangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer can meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whether the handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and on traffic stops I'm no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it if it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased a racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years since ... on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cut us off the outcome\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court you think police officers pushing back to demonstrate so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this topless men to start of the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take you out and get out and get on a given politics and instead you you're doing it against a do it but then the tip of the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training\nPolice violence against citizens in the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... that activity is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that\nYou always have reasonable thing to do the event as particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their life in danger so this technical issue is how you approach and the ... and how you go to house\nA well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment and stand up for training\nWhich would certainly help us make gay the negative perception of of policing the profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome of premeditated activity that was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate the incidents killed by members of the topic this is absolutely cannot accept\nThat is Maria haven't felt she is a professor in the department of law and police
