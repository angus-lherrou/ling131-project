Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to\nRepublican but that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving part as I got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could uh give the Republicans some\nHope the way we hand or home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floor is he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nFor security for her you know you need certain order and in your home you know the

Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal barricades\nWars we've while you know\nSit outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently does agree with the parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party he asked me\nI mean who's holding all that or you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is a reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJews have ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority\nYou know voters tomorrow but Garcia says data\nDon't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be\nUs citizens twenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera\nHas any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what do they say they'll say um how could you be a\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\n'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWell one way you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised here and my parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nLike a different platform than the one the trumpet\nHere so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House it's something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot edits Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it would be asked to approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juices\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way she does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be sealed for generations to come\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nTrump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa\nIt might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that these offices are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described a six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone you wouldn't you described those things\nYou might not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor and this is well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know specific show academy between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with it\nTend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted other classes and story they needed to be told\nThat I've been to a cookie sheets the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she must took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nPlease don't like that\nWhy are you [noise]\nObviously I Know\nRoy sweated a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator what thank you so much for talking with us\nMark ... how did you come up with this idea frankly\nSponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea frankly\nWe have an overt presentation of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see what I could do something about it in order to at least to find a baby or expectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here is that people thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus\nOn a video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content\nFor both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want\nPolice officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say

content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put that in schools and making it mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of police academy and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nImmediately jumped to supporting them and telling their stories rather than going into production about all that and the countdown

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty oath [laughter]\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what what is the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the ...\nThey may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people and just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline coming up for the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nThe professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make that make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not funny\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when your piece published on on line Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close now it's about it a try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who those donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who knows judges were and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThe just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating it\n... which suggest that perhaps they may try to reconstitute it in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam ... he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their mind today we want to talk about how Hollywood it's putting the opioid crisis front and center in the network but he has shown\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show after it start Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and and it we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opium\nIt's got to be wrong we want us to talk about it so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself and also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yankees uh CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back here and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people try to avoid it some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say you know it's\nReally interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right\nAnd the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "20"}
