CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact check for us can the president\nDo this most constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states is\nSeems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a cost\nStick to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nWill hear more about climate anxiety as a growing mental health concern that report coming up this afternoon at five forty four\nOn Ninety One point five K.

for the arts from NPR News\nThis is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates and more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country how do you go around you ended up leaving\nThe women around the circle and here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political\nOrganizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nTrapped by the women's march I have actually\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty six\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWhat is\nWhy why are\nWe only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice this would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it is actually missing is urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I get up relationships with the middle of all because I was in the police and the other police officers say something\nLife will he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is six to my brother's six three\nThere are all starts it\nAnd we didn't use ...\nEvery man in the pros but these women also talked about education\n...\nEvery man and the whole law\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like ... all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nBlack women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American\nIt was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a ... in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley herself but no

tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gunned down eleven people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on gab a social network that prides itself on being censorship free\nGas has since gone dark but the company says it's working around the clock to get back on line\nTo talk more about how gab has created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation at data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring gap for a while now before it was taken down how many people and gab react to the synagogue shooting\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nIn the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour bus again went on a media spray asking for users and explicitly tied this then to the white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ... was actively recruiting user\nSo the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these\nInstances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements I Want to\nPlay a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going in\nWould you expect us to do with those like that you want us to just censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that we are proposing here and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or the beach or we want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms\nGet filled with troll cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this as heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store is they've all cut ties with gas and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is\nThat there'll be able to replace their servers or domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as supporters of gab\nJoan Donovan is with data and society a research Institute in New York City thanks very much thank you\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all

news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and alleging scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either first what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWhat a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation\nThe bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny she said she lives in Fort ...\nSpeak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here the\nTiming is indeed curious yes ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV uh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six I mean a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention

on opposition groups\nIn fear of that the un has to shift the pieces on the transport\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the

Semitism in ways that are terrified said what strategies can we or\nThe Jewish community in particular employees to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember is that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us\nAnd so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when

to all things considered from NPR News\nHearing them out in the west we love our rivers are mountains are forced deserts and wildlife they're part of our economy's our lifestyles and our identities but that very connection makes us vulnerable to a growing mental health problem climate anxiety Ninety One point\nStyles and our identities but they're very connection makes us vulnerable to a growing mental health problem climate anxiety by one point five here she sees and we'd whether explains\nWander around any town center or school campus around here and ask\nThis question what do you feel about climate change and you may hear something like this\nAre we to drew Carey for words to describe\nI Can't remember a time I wasn't thinking about it I saw it in the back of my mind and now at the ice\nIs now and then like the sea level is rising that sounds kind of scary and lowering the\nThings just got even scarier with the United nations latest report on\nClimate just shot warnings from the United nations panel on climate which was a scientist rising on climate change can reach crisis level increase he Twain flooding drowned the loss of species\nIt's enough to make anyone anxious and groups like the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association are paying attention they're publishing reports on how the fear of climate change can harm mental health\nSabrina home wanted to find out who among us is the most vulnerable she's a researcher at the University of Arizona she did a survey of several hundred people and found that\nPeople who have are concerned about nature and the environment and general plants and animals [laughter] those are the ones who also report highest ecological stress um unfortunately also depression\nHound believe people in the deserts of the west are especially sensitive you are\nVery aware about oh how fragile are the natural environment it's\nFor help them move from Germany to the desert ... some years ago all of this hits home it\nSeems very dire to me you know if you read so much research which paints not such a nice picture of future development it affects the research with as well\nIn fact based on homes research people who study the environment may actually be among the most affected by climate anxiety people like Michael Lou said he's a conservation biologist in northern Idaho a few years ago he and his wife discovered a new species of slug\nIt was really exciting to find a new species\nOnly to discover it was vulnerable to climate change he says it was disorienting to add a creature to the known world and simultaneously fear for its future but he says climate change as part of his everyday reality as a biologist as a parent and as a mountain dweller\nLast two summers in August it was just a nervous a smoke and that has really gotten people talking about climate change I think\nHe says it makes me sad\nIt also really motivates me to work\nAnd that has really gotten people talking about climate change I think he says it makes me sad but it also really motivates me to work and find solutions for\nUs this positive attitude fits with Sabrina how research her study found that people who are the most stressed or depressed about global warming also tend to be the most proactive about finding solutions Laura Schmidt is a perfect example of that she's a recent environmental humanities graduate from the University of Utah\nMy knowledge corrupt grad school greatly increased as well as my anxiety and then I realized that you have to do something right\nSo she started convening support groups in Salt Lake City for people to talk about their climate anxieties the group became what she now calls the good grief network she says climate anxiety something mainstream psychotherapy just hasn't addressed head on yet\nYou know seeing the the world around us come crashing down or or be changed in in ways we can't even imagine is definitely going to have a psychological toll on us\nShe's growing the good grief network beyond Utah and even beyond the U. S. into Canada and Europe while developing the program Smith interviewed scientists activists and writers about how they cope during hard times\nAlmost everybody said that you know they had some sort of spiritual practice and you know some some people who are like I go for a walk in the forest\nOr for some folks it could be a church Tom Trinidad is the pastor ... faith Presbyterian Church in Colorado Springs\nSome folks come to the church and they just want to be able to unburden a their concerns in their hearts and that's all we can do sometimes but if you only say\nJust trust God and there's nothing you can do about it\nThen that also robs them of the dignity of their human responsibility and so we try to do a little bit of both\nHe says even Pope Francis wrote a lengthy treatise on actively dealing with climate change\nSo I Would say that all of us need to be talking about this\nFor Laura Schmidt it's as simple as that you\nCan see this as a great opportunity for connection and for meaning and for community building or you can sort of shut down and look the other way\nFor the mountain west news bureau I'm alley Bodner\nNinety One point vote to yours you see is a member of the mountain west news bureau find out more to your C.
