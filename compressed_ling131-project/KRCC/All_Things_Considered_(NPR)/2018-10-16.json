he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here [laughter] well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a million ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who is that at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae BP woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not yeah\nI Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this raid wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to

and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different

think that shapes your experience\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air force intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so in so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all

made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nTime I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene [noise]\nUm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae BP keep candidates as well do you know\nI mean I can tell you that you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks and\nWhen someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a million discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em and to your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running

I have one\nThat's the word and show dumb in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men that other I Will prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the ... being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give up fewer tickets for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat that's the thing gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDom is putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different past the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last\nTell me that if that was like [noise]\n\nOn the mental health ward

are free to walk about the large common room with bell on the therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around two cells there for so here and then friends he runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here

usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it the Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe wording has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know war and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six to not cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night\nThis is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one

toward Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings and person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nCanada or Mexico first a cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nSo that's one of the relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team\nAnd during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president and so a big part\nBut he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi

in the oval office recently and she talked about pushing his role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough August there is such a

not happy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it I'm for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin so I'm On a\nAfter ... showed gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance or one of the criticisms of caution there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back
