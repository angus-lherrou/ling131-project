this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high\nSo why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans I he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally\nOne um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested it at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWith wanted a jar of him and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen [noise] a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully before it ever [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he was out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue there are two new polls from ... that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country\nAnd those supporting Republicans intimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nSunday weekend edition and Saturday we can edition for that matter both begin at six AM here on Ninety One point

Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called ... it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who had to give the Republican some\nHope so we we had our homes especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nSecurity for her you know you need a certain order and in your home you know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall doesn't get any of it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better door when you're a ... year old son\nBecause I just saw not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better door when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nThat war people out you know\nThe upside and within seconds you'll run into people who beat him and he does agree with their and like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party he asked me\nI mean who's holding all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is no reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJuices Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nAnd not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern Phoenix and the district state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say they'll say um\nRepublican when the Republicans don't support\n'em Hispanics they'd all support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocks on ...\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was telling you they're almost zero Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have legs including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\n... you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised which are immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against the Latino\nCandidates I'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug new see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nDo the hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor has done a lot to move away from the ...\nIt wouldn't be as who approached do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor has done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juicy\nBut under that logic\nIt Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to a vote and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be sealed for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nTrump may be [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was President Trump pitch the campaign trail and US Marshal narration\nAnd we'll just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but at any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis this was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet some eyebrows had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David Cay he is the United nations special repertory on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world\nK. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what ah what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to Adam seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nGeneral or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation looked like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion ...\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide\nOr they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our ... events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number\nOf options available to them whether its diplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international investigation\nThat Steven King thank you\nThank you the un special representative and this is NPR News\nIn about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two and had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used the word from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin\nNow there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to know Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized wise about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free library\nThe wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up this sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them in prison than Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nHospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing than being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing life as a result of his idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us and thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little libraries big heroes and we were talking about little libraries founder and tumble who died yesterday\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News and the

called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala\nAnd he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants so let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nOr this group of migrants that has now grown to ... and we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to this grids that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that sends thousands of people started walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico had closed a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against migrants and then the gate shut\nAgain um it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nAs I said okay that's what it all but one of the vote for [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here down it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still writes here uh near the bridge\nAnd and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of hot uh from Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cop now he's probably four years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom Mexican\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they gonna\nAndy hydration as well as some people who actually suffered a broken bone in the classroom\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them and as asylum seekers and so many of them saying we are not going to leave their friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed lips border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to close to every one a show and it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and a man getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware that a Trump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that his fans but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what in fact at home is worse than whatever Trump and put in front of us\nAll right
