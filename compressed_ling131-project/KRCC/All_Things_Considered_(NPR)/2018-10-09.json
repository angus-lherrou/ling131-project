young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to let them know the number one vote count 'em and you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about more than just the sport that basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou it was after we I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of times\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect your life\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question but but what just seems like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power half to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an afro but I Do want to hear from lawyers who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by

of how we go about making sure but I Will say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all of the work is important that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to be as unrealistic\nAnd that's the see people's hearts change towards

executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual

they're subject to these rules to be affected he says prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online

the training\nAnd the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures

well Gallagher's residential property rate will continue to drop\nMiller says this would have unintended consequences like decreasing money for things like paying firefighters especially in rural areas were property values aren't that high and homeowners may end up paying more in the long run but at least a while since the amendment would create a steady stream of funds so school districts
