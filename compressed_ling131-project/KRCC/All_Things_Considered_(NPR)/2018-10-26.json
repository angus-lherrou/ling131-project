border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee\nMore quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you Mary Louise how you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance partly because we built a reward illegal immigration we really need to have it as being legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and ... and set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de be northern tribe countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the network that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts that they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course\nIt's agree though that it's important to deal with the facts that they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this our land that I've had I I Do not have any specific evidence\nIn this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats [noise] want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest river homeland security most of these laws aren't under my company's jurisdiction ... we've got another my Comey's jurisdiction because as soon as this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather the information find areas of agreement in our community ... you know we all agree on a secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want enforce our laws and we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin

three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here see motion all\nYeah I'm sure it is it's crazy\nWhat does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today a sick I get sick sick man just the word or to see it on the freeway on here and\nAnd it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the

and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in a suburb beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\n... between the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you

big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and reflect the bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes it's a much though I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ...\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because\nI'm all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us

immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi John hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWill the fears are really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean is reportedly dropped by half from seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Houston Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWinning cannot have any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however uh that al ... officer and agents at at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they can't have any ability of course then defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out

numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've\nThanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July ... agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that [noise]\nSo a border patrol agents out checked just told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with

destination in the interior\nAnd at least thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him are overwhelmed\nImmigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nRight the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted to travel ban then he'll give it's his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders\nNPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas thanks to\nYou about [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were a scientist potential trouble including lead to business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing as fast as my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more\nEli Maloof is America CEO of ice age gee the hotel group than on Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr shut records around Labor Day an immoral Davis your fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending offer for trip spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who were spending more government spending was also walked Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news in today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number despite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that\nKen ... percentage point a meager number despite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory Jaczko is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see them headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds included a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nDeco also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wing by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much for momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated\nThere's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working and spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong\nJim Zarroli NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from
