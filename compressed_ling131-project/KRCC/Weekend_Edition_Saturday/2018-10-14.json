is a common sense [noise]\nPeople who are lucky to have them or using gas powered generator until utility crews to fix all of a downfall and wires and restored their electricity say county emergency services chief mark Bowe\nAnd says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says got parents and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations

report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as a voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida\nWe know Florida as a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark a poodle covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nDriving me All right so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago using a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nBy thing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and and all\nThe associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was\nPost I remember the city of a wave wind in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes were wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction new trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott a Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally rich got was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nSaid it was pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ... in Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico\nBeach right in the uh the\nThe county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum\n... and in this case it appears so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of been the same thing he was an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right\nIn the uh the\nThe county ... county which is where ... space shuttle had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually change showing trees away\n[laughter] and moving debris really show he's changed on your trees [laughter] he's making\nSure Gillum is that he was not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment and and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle meals impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating in a sense of the people\nThat political as more computer joining

Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nHave a really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yet so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a hamster surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding and you know\nChanged enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection they could flip the seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that\nSort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica
