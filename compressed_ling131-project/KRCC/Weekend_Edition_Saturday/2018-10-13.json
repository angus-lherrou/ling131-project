one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually an anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\nI think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMay I ask did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately\nMy church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face\nI think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less

fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\nDo you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of of

face up\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like the shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chant she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about

[noise]\nAny individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and then to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police I was about to get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear enough thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not asleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I

though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a\nTeacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment on coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true\nBut I Know I'm a

this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report [noise]\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic

think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church\nI don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMay I ask did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do\nNo I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse that was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\n[noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the

sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy

probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a rider we practice that I still have now\nBut that ride early practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't really think so\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like the shards of abuse\nAnd you know and I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the ... that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll

things that I was when I say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I thing led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em [noise] and he knew virtually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and has a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police I was about to get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [noise] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time in my body broke my body literally broke from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap right\nWent to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way a you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about their physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still\nCan't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks oh\nI Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save\nAnd I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer Norman American
