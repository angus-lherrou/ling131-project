yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected to Samantha conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we can both named conservative justices shooters Stevens black men Kennedy who he issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations good\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named to Bush and now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been growing for some of the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench and it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially is they're going to be um more prominent\nEver in us life or the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Lucas legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook in philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past to judge generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal

clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court but the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine\nBlasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed a diversity of views which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also\n[laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blows before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise] um and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not with Kevin ... name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats\nUm and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support for it a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh is gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a\nJail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise] [noise] I'm\nTrump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major\n[noise] [noise] [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations GMO Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is your jacket bitter Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you got is their head or if there's the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump ... over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co sign of loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his office\nThe aim of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it\nIn Pueblo right now it's forty seven degrees today in Pueblo will have partly sunny skies with the highest fifty seven and tonight mostly

Supreme Court today\nThis despite what we can imagine to be the objections of his fellow Democratic senators and what we know to be some very vocal objections protesters have gathered at the Capitol Kayla Wilson is one of those protesters usual way west Virginian and founder of the women jak this group\nBoss babes in that state as Wilson thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what's your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for judge capital\nDevastating but it's honestly not the first uprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument\nDonald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote more Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people in West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin uh people mostly most people supported Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you choose a politician to being a politician says that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection\nOf course and I did it to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell her tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go while still on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on my two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told\nStories of sexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he got away he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the real divide us back for like ...\nYou you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge he has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision [noise]\nDoes your continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed or how does it do\nOur does continue so uh as far as the Senate goes we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kinda truly doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical and West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nDemocratic ... though this was all your opinion with me underscore my pay\nNo of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well\nI think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republican says well we'll continue her yeah so we're working on working statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if you if you're Jones is if you of excepted senator mansions votes for what it is and I'm Still support among the great many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me [noise]\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as
