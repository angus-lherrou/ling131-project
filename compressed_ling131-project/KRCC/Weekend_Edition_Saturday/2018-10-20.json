arrested in the case then crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on purged two of his advisors or which had to be linked to the operation\nPresident Trump called the Saudis statement credible a good first step but key members of Congress from both sides of the aisle questioned the Saudi account\nWhich is at odds with the Turkish explanation that says\nThere was a ... team with a bone saw an a plan to kill ... with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years ... thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the shouting statement what does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal Turkish authorities have been continuing

based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ...\nWhen he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of the value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed and\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed and in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nOr in our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using\nIn our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can\nFind ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen top two weeks is not acceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is it new you probably remember Hector mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us like you wire us retired special forces which is much talk about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah you're\nIn the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world\nReview or special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges\nBarracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and\nWe don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is mhm\nBut your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to his longest party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether you as\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now\nAnd these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign those were just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or us ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it [noise] um are there other Americans\n... and other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to

NPR News I'm Scott Simon we've learned over the past few years of the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of the smiling face of metal and Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ... but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production continent of high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you [noise] what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister in law is beautiful and bright she loved to saying she wanted to be an actress and starring proudly\nOr was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect to real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary\nPatients and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen table will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\n... rich on there [noise] I Can't make you love me\nIndeed I don't know\nAbout her sister Maddy\nIndeed fun now

jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step but it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in your mouth ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment worth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response but\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nA cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and

much for being with us thank you Scott [noise]\nWell President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on its face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlist in residence at the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed and have it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military and those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the

of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Brunson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly whenever\nThe Trump Administration has put all of their ... basket and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\nSo maybe it's Me Margaret ... says this is so\nSad but Bronson says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhat's your ... represented for many of us was this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow and he couldn't be patient and he he expected to be patient about what he didn't expect with the reversal that he was seeing with ... on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work

the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were

it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some

gee\nWe turn now to even do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us clout to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that American\nUh in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain does interest but at the very least in in the rhetoric that we are a um a using\nIn our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen cops you weeks\nIs unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nInstead of your brass 'cause we've

the ... that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of metal and Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for Modi\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production gotten out of high school party\nA drug too cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form\nPain killer I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you ... or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and such and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect\nStigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that not even one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a [noise]\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen table so we'll play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and

he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men any child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of

Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be

two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\nPompeo told reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss

the kingdom is pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... men lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel bras and

companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism

I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter]\nI Know and in in that sport it's a big deal in in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on

and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contests but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break serve\n[laughter] of Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorate and fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on\nThe medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nWent to maybe even HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant and risk transferring HIV or\nLet the child grow sicker and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa we're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world Dr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at Vince Donald Gordon medical center that's where the transplant happened and\nShe was part of a team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks

gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision record you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't [noise] [noise]\nYeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that through doing the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living during a\nFull three times the average and this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... we're well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so there was this need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah\nThat she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to

many countries around the world\nWould like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays I've from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized and one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that\nIf you're an HIV positive person and

shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday",
