to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump\nSo let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn Lucas Meyer is the executive director of the nation\nCity in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse

campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign [noise]\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar lines between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white

in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since

I Want to turn to you now I'm Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum\nHas been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration\nA so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how\nWe as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely yeah so in\nIn one reason study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about\nIn Pueblo right now it's forty three degrees today in Pueblo sunny skies with the highest Seventy two than snide mostly clear with low forty one\nAnd in woodland park right now it's thirty nine degrees this morning we'll have clear skies with the highest sixty six than mostly cloudy tonight with a ... of thirty nine degrees the puzzle with Will Shortz is coming up next on weekend edition Sunday on Ninety One point five ...\nProgramming on Ninety One point five K.

problem and a boy why ... why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nWhen ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door and basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible\nDay a mother walked through his door and basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking most impossible standard than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened and the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw that is\nVery very strict very very sick people because the boxing from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had to wear the change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous

government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic county leaders took the idea and ran with it\nNow\nTo tackle the opioid epidemic county leaders took the idea and ran with it now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a national emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representatives from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group they come straight out of FEMA's emergency response flavor six\nTerm is completed may talk through PowerPoint slides think sounds like fire is kind of\nThe number it's referred items on there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces\nLike distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train school teachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nThis to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she sent an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetime [noise] um by breaking it down like he didn't an elephant you can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members

custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lulu [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as a day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year\nMass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern rate\nI mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an active hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm for cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and I'm ... people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise] um and it says you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm an end to the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise]\nWell you mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a that's of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place it's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it\nAnd said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing that communities doing to try to help stay on leaves a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nA incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside but then a God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty what helped the tour such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that's the sentences but unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this has he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out um [noise] uh of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with\nThis was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out um [noise] uh of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I\nI think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is there's a search for why after the a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for crimes that they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat tells us something about why

of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics we're at the scene\nOr medics

place anywhere\nIn we won't work locally to make those changes happen and we'll work with partners around this country and around this world to make sure that it and it's\nOne of the think again all

Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though that Tina voter are any racial minority they're presented us\nI mean typically when we talk about black voters or the teen of voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\nBut when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense right\nWhite is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me they detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also just a accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it\nAt racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why it but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nStreaming online at ... dot org\nGood morning I'm John ... and it's a minute before eight o'clock coming up in the next hour a weekend edition Sunday will have the latest information about the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and Brazil's voters are casting their ballots today and the second round of presidential elections\nNPR on Ninety One point five kill your cc is supported locally for the Rocky Mountain women's film festival November ninth through the eleventh for thirty one years presenting films through the female ends from documentaries shorts and features the animated films full schedule at R.

more than a third of the country's homicides are committed here\nAnd then it says along with the violence there are also not enough jobs\nLike and I think a lot to do with either that or that at all

of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to

been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans in was enraged about the geo peace\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about\nThe geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back\nEven to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S
