Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much so\n\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome sir I'm All right\nComing from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave at what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving this race is\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd tuition would reverse would Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping that score a flip and one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of ah Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I've\nAnd Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of ah Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives\nFor the next ten years read Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you forty\nFive years ago this Sunday

campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identifying for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse during the day that we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other [noise]\nSuppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context um [noise]\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role that his identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly gasoline I I think you can easily go wrong hair\nI mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know all through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern and identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look and the fact is in our country today is that where more divided around identities then we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration\nDenver things than we are around policies so that if we stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a photo sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every concession is no coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere by the question is whether you can do that with ... you go Rodney weaponized identity\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs a capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is polite that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nTest Kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chefs NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in\nChief of the night when you live I mean she had a good to meet you were a little excited\nLucy likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pot pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes penny and she takes a diesel Lucy decides to taste it\nGoes what are the things\nThough [laughter] at one\nPoint while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't mind understand\nFalls says why\nPoint while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nSo this is one table\nToo that's at that says ts be which is the abbreviation for peace bone and this is one capital T that the table and let me ask you something mind at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yes recall it\nDecoding kitchen speak there are so many words in these recipes that you just don't know until you cooked alert though it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion at first it has to deal\nWith this song [noise] you like watching the coup\nAgainst the size of safety in the kitchen which Birnbaum demonstrates went shopping the onion it can be hard to make\nThis first Koch so yeah AC on my fingers are like all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way to hold and I had a anything\nStreaming online at ... dot org\nGood morning I'm John ... before eight o'clock\nComing up in the next hour a week in addition Sunday we'll hear the latest on this weekend's parliamentary elections in Afghanistan\nAnd we'll hear from a former U.S aid administrator about President Trump's threat to cut aid because we my ring caravan in Guatemala that's coming up in the next hour on here see see\nIf you are looking for something to do in the Ninety One point five care cc listening area check out the community counseling care she C. dot org GE and you can submit your event there as well\n\nFrom NPR News Washington\n[noise]\n\nAn awesome\nDid they gain of are the morning and important milestone in Afghanistan to fight bombs parliamentary election what that means for the longest running water Saudi Arabia has admitted that missing Sally journalist was killed in that conflict and the shifting\nExplanations as to what happened and why\nHave regional reaction to the crisis engulfing one of the middle east most powerful countries also a journalist in Mexico and with her life to find out what happened to a group of ...

Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate and assemble ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty and many of them issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and ah and king so of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissident [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now a there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\nAnd you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information\nIt's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very\nAmerican ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed a Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need him less meant that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the INS was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was best known among many a political scientist at the University of

destination was Mexico City poor demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why although there remains have never been found\nArrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water although there remains have never been found their deaths were various Lee blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and species that we should start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official bearish on satellite is not true it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and that for the police not Joss Whedon not nice about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I have reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if the police were chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the hours before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students kills\n[noise] well that students arrive near while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that to both is where they were transport dating insight to the city\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the broadest to Mexico City so they went to was a station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying\nTo ... station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to escape on board obese by buses from the ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east start to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back more to bust us\nFrom these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on the bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um oh if the students were traveling inside buff is that it was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus\nWhat exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from the school to why why so\nWhen I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss the secret compartment as
