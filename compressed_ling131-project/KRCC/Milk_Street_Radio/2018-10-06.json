clear protestors warm the cap [noise]\nWhat lasting impact of this on the court on the national mood on the mid term election to talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting Canada and then just a few minutes later Joe mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought us to very clearly locked in ...\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly and are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or did this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nAnd and for me it it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust and the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so [noise]\nAnd and for me it it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust and the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that is fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court is justice partisan and tribal as everything else and where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak\nThanks everybody thanks glad to be here Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of so we\nGet these people of color and these are held we will never know why and if we [noise] we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where it's Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week it's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this guy is running a masterful campaign huh in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying the as far as I actually met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nShe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that he was governor\nMe you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman care and yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nShe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that he was governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she is editor in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe shows me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still um you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you're talking about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate his you're pointing out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there\nThere were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson\nWhat did you see yeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there\nThere were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being the hardliners on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country\nThat is really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that\nOne of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr he's lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and\nIt was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line or an incentive to Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a Dominican

with a special broadcast through the mid term elections in so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight

mom is this backlash\nReal and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there how's it going ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible with this well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point up tech enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the\nGeneric ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republicans than for a Democrat just in the past week yes there is this just in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're so much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus\nDo with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know there's\nAnd they kind of fade away again or do we think this has staying power\nIf you're talking

away again or do we think this has staying power\nMe if you're talking about psychology um the emotion of anger\nAnd fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember

moment [laughter] of energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and anger as ... as a motivating factor as much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got some of the things we're gonna talk about what had been big deals and other weeks\nBut this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nBill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money to run that agency and old it's functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving you a big receipts Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also to band so phone talking in flight on all flights you

has not yet given you a bigger seat and neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also ah to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... are there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI'd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and abroad and eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wanted to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base it that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them ... and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but and fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country with that same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner\nThey're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going\nThe state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual
