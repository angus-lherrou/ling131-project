broadcast every week through the mid term elections breaking down the major themes we're seeing that\nI Need you to your friends your family your neighbors your co workers they did vote Republican\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot that if history is a guide most Americans won't vote in the midterms even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't but it is because I feel that I'm always too busy\nBeing away from home but also connected to the the political system I don't believe that it actually is effective today we're\nGoing to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR to medical ... and ... holiday hey guys\nHey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well about the right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent\n... a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well about them right\nAnd that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting the it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually are just obstructed from voting like they want to open they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and also I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for the audience\nSure sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a writer on the Las Vegas strip and\nWhy it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five or twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nOr never voted before more from what I Do about voting is are you show up to the whole place and I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during her\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think him like\nHe wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy\nTo us political junkie this is sort of things that we assumed people know but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen then spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to their particular place that they live in and she'll be maybe it's actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks the registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like he didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about its transportation and just sort of a logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAh last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as a Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd uh so they said why just three months or let's let them go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nPlans don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from the larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nAnd that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches us up on some of the headlines that we might have meant because of all the other news is happening\nThank

their money back every week for the midterm elections we're going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on her side [noise]\nWith James just they just throw it\nIn the history of our churches\nRepublicans once thought the major tax cut they passed would be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery of the middle class\nWe're going to dig into the policy of a big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are ya it with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress is um they passed this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit but\nThey also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nAnd they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was\nThings are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economists and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional Paul\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and get\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House saying no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nBasically we're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kinda high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tests\nThe well also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just a tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to raise people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they weren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five\nPercent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a man on second the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut is that where it's going to be a as we approach the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIs the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "13"}
