saying for a period of a week two a month in some cases\nWhat I typically looks like it's a lot of political event there's often flag raising ceremony you go out and you swear allegiance to the Communist Party there's a red songs singing patriotic songs singing activities\nThere's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there's also cultural events that people participate in their drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticence to doing this sort of thing because for a week or this is Saddam is not comic activity\nAll of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are how willing they are to participate in hon cultural activities [noise] one of the things that the manual that the ... billion to use one of the things that they advocate is that you ask the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the legion says of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes that they report on their host to like some higher authority\n[noise] yeah that's one of the primary goal of what they're doing is fact finding

experiences as a pretty extreme form of maternal is them a kind of in ...\nAnd they feel like it's a violation of their personal space and up their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese leader languages now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and we were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in his government project so I found a variety\nOf perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who have lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies where\nPopulations were polarized an extreme way and all speech in action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that I came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pin that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrade or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nThey also seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders\nLike in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kind of enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances\nEchoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they train their final solution is lasting stability or long term security but it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that
