speaking with us and given what you need\nAn update now on a case that also touches on issues of freedom of expression you may recall the name Laura ... she's a University of Florida graduate who was accepted into a master's program at Hebrew University in Israel I'll go some was granted a student visa to travel there\nBut when she landed in Tel Aviv two weeks ago Israeli authorities revoked her visa and barred from entering the country reporter Daniel ... has been following the store and she joins us now so there's news on al ... case today Daniel what happened\nFor the news is that the Supreme Court and it's real rural that her student fee that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel and for Laura ... who is she in why did Israeli officials detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law and twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved and calling for a boycott of Israel and so it's real estate lawyers said that al ... father is a Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice and Palestine a pro Palestinian group while\nShe was at the University of Florida and she present an ongoing risk of calling for a boycott while in the country and until now the lower courts have sided with the state lawyers but her lawyers say that she hasn't been active in that group for more than a year she's also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominating conservative political class in Israel see the judge's ruling\nThe Hebrew University supported law al ... and an even sent their lawyer to bakar up but education minister Naftali Bennett\nHe's from the far right the Jewish Home party he said that that that was an improper move by the university and when I was at the court case last week in Tel Aviv I asked Israelis and the neighborhood what they thought of law at all costs in case and they said\nYou know if she doesn't like this country\nShe doesn't need to come but there are definitely other people who I've heard say this does not look good for a country that caused the top of democracy\nAnd as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this hearing judges seemed to be very skeptical of the way that the Israeli authorities were interpreting is two thousand Seventeen\nSo now Laura ... is free to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is\nWe're interpreting this two thousand Seventeen law\nSo now Lara al ... is free to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets her is she going to face pressure not to get involved and activism\nEarlier this week some students quite an empty chair and class saying this is reserved for cost them and they wrote it also in Arabic\nAnd then that's fine with they faced by right wing ears so you can see that her presence and Hebrew University is definitely going to raise questions\nBut she's also in any program for human rights and transitional justice her fellow classmates are going to be dealing with questions around that very issue that she challenged and so I'm sure it'll be a ... year with plenty of academic and non academic thing to discuss\nDaniel ... thanks very much for your time thinking Marco\n[noise]\nTeacher pictures of this for the United nations years ago along with drawings and people being the end and

camp for heavily guarded labor calling me with about forty six thousand political prisoners including children [noise]\nAt your ducked prison camps armed guards for sister junk to do hard labor for sixteen hours\nA day seven days a week in the winters were so cold that the dead bodies of other prisoners would freeze into what he calls big jelly blocks of flash and Mr John would have to break them apart with a shovel and bury them as part of his job\nOf movies do\nYou get in but at the ocean and was treated like\nShovel and bury them as part of his job\nOf movies do\nYou get into that and

years of rebuilding its life but never forgetting the people he left behind his friends neighbors fellow prisoners even family Mr John has a younger brother and North Korea who calls him about once a month using a burn or cell phone\nSo let's get back to the car with Mr Jones and the focus of the day is sending food and USB some drives fall of forbidden media to North Korea is all just dirt path

smuggler it's on the border of China\nMr Jones latest send over strategy is a little different he sends the packages in the water\nHe waits for the lowest possible tides which happens twice a month and then what's the current carry the packages to North Korea [noise]\nThe packages are waterproof the rice and us bees are in recycled to leader water bottles they're stuffing Bible donated by a church into sealed plastic bags and then taping them to the side for those bottles [noise]\nAids sent to North Korea is often supplied by Christian churches and missionaries are also known to get

hundred USB thumb drive four hundred parasite treatments two hundred bibles and a hundred and fifty US dollars [noise] once the tide is at its lowest [noise]\nThere were only in a bottle of rice and other goods into the water and you're starting to see them slow\nDown the current towards North Korea [noise]\nAnd about six hours to packages will reach North Korea and they'll probably be picked up by young soldiers men who are often under fed and forced into their job Mr Jong is okay with that\nHe hopes the USB its will be passed along so that each one can have an impact on multiple people\nSome North Koreans the wealthier one\nDo have computers smartphones that the government has the power to monitor them very closely [noise]\nA lot of North Korean devices can automatically detect foreign media files and stop them from opening in some cases devices even delete them\nNorth Korean phones are also known to automatically take screen shots and police can ask to see them

he is a devils with a smile on his face he killed his own brother\nHe'll assassinated his brother and also he killed one of the relatives so he still person who doesn't really treat the people\nIn the way they should be\nTrump claims he mentioned human rights during the summer but there's no public record of what he said Mr Jong wants to be helpful but he's not convinced that the summit will have any real effect on the still unfolding tragedy of North Korea he called it political theater last question\nMr Jong do you think you'll do this work for the rest of your life and what are you hoping
