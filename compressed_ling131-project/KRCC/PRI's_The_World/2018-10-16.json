S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others well\nThe reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present any kind of risks of society or biscuit fleeing that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nAnd then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border\nThe Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico\nAnd telling them that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flatly illegal under both US law and international law\nSo there is these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to us asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian griffey says Amnesty

consequences or grade she actually had a medical emergency where she had to be rushed to the hospital because of health it's here in so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented us in court and still they prolonged her attention\nFinally actually it was only when a congressperson peso O'Rourke got involved that she was released in it'll took to reunite with her grandson\nWhere our Maria and her grandson today there in Connecticut he's still under state custody she was seeking to move from weekend visits to having guardianship
