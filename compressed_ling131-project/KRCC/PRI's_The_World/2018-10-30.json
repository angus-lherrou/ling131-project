S. a record low cap under President Trump to making the laws of migrants coming to this country miserable\nNow Trump says he plans to eliminate birthright citizenship that's the idea that if you were born in the U. S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution for the president told actually as he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university and the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there's an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming it\nSure the fourteenth amendment comes into being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million ... former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be\nIn a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation fourteenth amendment declares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens at the United states\nSo let's talk about that a more in a moment I'm up because it's all part of of your research let's just get into the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior case that came close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court\nMost important case for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named belong Kim arc\nUm decided by the Supreme Court in Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants\nWho cannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts at the period but long himself assumes and south to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he\nLeaves states to do business in China\nAnd when he returns he's detained at the port\nAnd refused entry entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that\nPort and refused entry entry his case goes to the U.S Supreme Court where the court affirms that even as long Kim ... parents cannot become citizens of the United states he because he was born in the U.S pursuant to the fourteenth amendment is a citizen\nYou know at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people\nI have to believe that we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that and more people are going to be more willing to help\nJose Antonio Vargas his new book is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen thank you\nThank you so much for having me [noise]\nWe have ... always full interview with ... by the way as a world dot O.

GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nRedeeming any patriotic folding on line the sponsoring scaling man picking Kennedy so they face information just change democracy and we're allies are prevalent like truth\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming budget ... thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it in the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of\nThe ... their digital lives so Maria ... so we just heard from her more from her in a moment ... we've reported on the store that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so what\nHappened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platform helped his campaign released\nA lot of help to ... uh during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power of the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria ... a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook the tension in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between new James and ...\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nI think Facebook lung damage to the Philippines and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like the [noise] countries way institutions are clear corruption is rampant ...\nThese these don't have a large is\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules right if you don't implement those rules for ... and the chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints well\nFacebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggests you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that\nRecently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there does\nThat suggests you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinating about it is that\nWhere your rent restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and\nThe the big question would you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation fake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here\nBecause there is no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your ... and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd seen that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world view is that the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way doesn't mean\nWe're or you know off it I I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they collect revenue um but uh it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention but it is so problematic so ... what are you going to do\nJames Jacoby with frontline park to other Facebook dilemma airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one online at PBS dot org James thanks very much for coming back you\nFood you eat the fever in terms\nYeah I mean not totally but it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. so Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nOf the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those and so the anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it comes from the writer or whether it's on civil law yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel in the Trump support the strong Israel so and Ron dreamers comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDana told me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking to hire the new kind of quickly moved on\nUm say over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the next person the shock of are the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand\nThe impact that this had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews a synagogue as a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I put a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\nAnd and after the moral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders caught it which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time but only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody's to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up at that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to find a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nDo you know the president does reveal across the differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israelis are two very different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong\nIn the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to knowledge that you know American Jews have\nDone fairly wealthy themselves in in America and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to lead them to be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in this sort of zero sum game it time you know a person is them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a transit of George plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\nReporter Dina cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks very much for your time thank you\n... ... ... ...\n...\n... ... ... ...\nAnd her life roof gates earned a reputation as a passionate defender of coral reefs [noise]\nWhen you look at organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing more corals that we would hope and that means the race of change in the environment of essentially out paste the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties and the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nTo figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking just to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an icon of closet or feel why\nSo she was then I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of coral very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of\nThe way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decide to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation\nAnd encouraging all diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world at coral science\nA more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help with coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major Corey bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I'm In coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades and yet roof goods remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWow at such a great question Marco I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her loss\nShe just looked forward and she felt like you know we can throw her hands up and give up or we can look for solutions than I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto a boat roof goods\nWhat is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about risk gets her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean sat him and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher Ruth Gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling us about Ruth and our condolences to you thank you so much
