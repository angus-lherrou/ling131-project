Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget today the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by it\nThe U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by itself\nWherever the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only advanced economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason ferment at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank international leave the u._s. is sandwiched between boot ton and Jamaica\nWere carrying are heavy debt load since World War two\nEconomists say when you're in a time of recession it's time to spend to get the economy going again when the economy is roaring along as it is now it's a good time to save says Chris Edwards he's the director of tax policy studies at the K to Institute a libertarian think tank in Washington\nThe Republican Party I used to be a ... outside of the national defense areas or the party of spending restraint but they no longer are you don't hear anything about ... spending restraint from major Republican leaders and the fact that we're in the ten year of an economic expansion now\nAnd that keeps rising is really extraordinary and very irresponsible unless Congress fundamentally changes the pan out its path we are headed for a Greek type crisis\nBut what exactly could that\nMean the rising a debt ah you know could could create this crisis situation where insurance rates a spike the government has to take drastic actions perhaps you know cutting benefits a Social Security and other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings evaporate could that happen in the United states of America ... gold wine doesn't see us as the next Greece but he does think we should be paying more attention to the\nDebt one of the scary things about that as we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is a senior policy director with a nonpartisan think tank the committee for responsible federal budget I don't think we're headed for great like crisis because unlike Greece\nTake the committee for a responsible federal budget\nI don't think we're headed for Greek like crisis because unlike Greece we borrow in our own currency and we can actually make her own party but I Do believe that our current path is unsustainable\nAnd I do believe that if there isn't a course correction at some point um we will face a financial crisis who actually potentially create a global financial crisis\nThat is not as bleak as a full scale Greek crisis bordering on anarchy Jason vermin at Harvard doesn't think either of those scenarios is likely he served as chair of President Obama's council of economic advisors and says the dead should have never been our number one issue in the first place\nBut I don't think it should drop off the list of concerns entirely either\nWhen it comes to the United states dead right now he says he subscribes to the termites in the word work theory\nThat every year they chip away at your prosperity a little bit and leave you a little bit worse off but without ever thing ever being really dramatic\nStill after a while your house we'll need to be fixed and continually delaying repairs we all know that's going to cost you for the world I'm Jason Margolis\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded to three scientists Donna Strickland of Canada Gerard ... of France and Arthur asked one of the U.
