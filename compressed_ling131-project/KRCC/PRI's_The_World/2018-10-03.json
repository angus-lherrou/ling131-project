that they could no longer dismiss them interesting the lead to a similar change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system in in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the monarch bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it on there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't commit a crime that type of behavior\nWhich was driven by their Shia of dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointments still the situation\nSuddenly enough said not so lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age that I'm a ... ... ... and that's one of the most famous English Czechoslovakian\nAge that I'm a ... cheese curds deteriorate and that's one of the most famous English Czechoslovakian and\nThe leading judge of the ... century started expressing some very a socially conservative views and books he was writing and\nThe feeling was that if judges were going to do this and that hunter edge they could bring the reputation of the courts into district periods so a retirement age was introduced it's currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nAt yes they have so there are exceptions but there are three small Pacific Island states where judges are typically brought in on a contract basis or for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to one side so it's striking that\nThere's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming little countries with the heritage that the u._s. system also shed\nSo here I Am a little confused about where the U.S sits right now so if you consider the systems of judicial appointments or in the\nCountries you've looked at into pair them to the current state of affairs in the U.S would you say the U.S is behind the times I\nI wouldn't say the U.S at the height of the time for its crisis which and rub out and has helped scrutiny\nEven if that's good news sometimes used for parties and put it this is what I Do want to highlight is the issue of retirement that we've been speaking about that is an area in which we've seen that the U.S has been left behind with other countries have introduced the time and it just\nEnded and the other problem that causes that we haven't talked about yet is the pressure on individual\nJustices to decide when to retire so Justice Kennedy made a very important decision when he retired now like any of us he's been title to to stop looking back that decision carried far more consequences\nBecause it was his and systems whether the retirement age a more predictable in that way and sets up less tension between\nPresidents do governments on the one side and judges on the other side who have to decide whether to yield the seats on the court to\nThe government of the day that will be choosing the next in Albany\nI'll never forget a surgeon
