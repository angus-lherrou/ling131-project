Trump on Fox News this morning\nI don't want to be very tough and we have investigators over there and we're working with turkey and frankly we're working with Saudi Arabia we want to find out what happened\nThe Turkish government disputes that us investigators are working with them and the question remains about just how tough Trump might be with the Saudis it's a key relationship for the U.S and fall as judges of the London School of economics says the consequences would be huge if relations become further strained\nWhat you have is an American president who use the world through the lens of business I'm profit or prioritize money and resources over the human rights it has made it very clear that this out the American relationship is very strategic\nWhat's involved or hundreds of billions of dollars is unwilling to break up relations with the Saudis but what you're going to see is a great push by the American foreign policy elite both\nDemocratic and Republican and you're going to see some major consequences when it comes to arms deal\nBetween the United states and Saudi Arabia and also probably vote in the U.S Senate against us support for\nThe war in Yemen and overall and and the Saudis sentiment but ... the American political and social establishment\nStory it's just kind of unbelievable I mean let's just say that you mentioned Congress and I imagine

demographics have got both parties paying close attention\nI never wanted to be a candidate\nJanuary ... swears she never wanted to be doing this shaking hands and raising money for a campaign even though she says people urged her to run after she served as an advisor to Janet Napolitano Arizona's last democratic governor\nI think there are many many ways to serve and it doesn't have to be as a candidate\nBut last year with President Donald Trump in office and Republicans in control of Congress ... says she felt powerless her son Noah remembers when he learned of his mom's plans to change\nThat we were at a dinner table and then dad said we talked this over and your mom's orange run to the attorney general Arizona\nNew is a high school freshmen who still rubbing his eyes the

[laughter]\nLike me and Lucas you remember yours for older son Lucas is a high school juniors first response was ordered the commercials are going to say about you\nDo you worry that political attack ads would target contrary for being Latino she's fourth generation Arizona and pro immigrant right\nOn the way to another event a fundraiser in a gated community contrary says that was a powerful moment for her one son asking about the risks people face when running for office the other asking why she wasn't taking a bigger risk for a more prominent position\nThere are a lot of people who don't know what the attorney general does but after\nServing in the Obama administration and creating a nonprofit that provides free legal services country or is as attorney general may help decide

candidates like ... and David Garcia for governor\nMore Latinos will vote and can tourists says she hopes that Latinos see in her someone like them someone they can trust\nBut she also knows that Latinos in Arizona\nDon't see themselves as a single group we don't always\nSee issues\nBut we certainly can see when others are trying to constantly\nMake issues about ethnicity from the other side and that is I think something that we will stand up for it and reject because I think it's clear to a lot of people including Latinos that there are people in power right now who want to treat\nA second class citizens\nThat may have helped spur a record turnout in the primaries last month with a big showing by democratic voters are loose drivers to confer he'll be one of them in next month's election\nAnd contrary confidence as she heads into her fundraiser\nI think it's time for the rest of the country to watch Arizona and watches it man more\nArizona is a state going through big changes this'll be the first election after Republican Senator John McCain passed away\nSenator Jeff flake seat is also open he was openly critical of Trump and will run again for another longtime Arizona figure former Sheriff Joe Arpaio was in the running for ... see she's well known for being tough on undocumented immigrant\nAnd many people fear\nAn undocumented immigrant and I know many people fear going you know at the moment I Want to\nPut our pile was not out in the primary Republican strategist Constantine card acknowledges that Republicans are vulnerable with some promises unfulfilled\nThey have not yet built the law they have not yet gotten rid of Obamacare and so you have a certain\nAmount of frustration within one party's base and a great deal of energy in the opposition parties base and that's what it can make these midterms are challenged\nBut ... says Republicans are entrenched in Arizona and they brought more resources into the state this election cycle you think more data base strategy to target voters card says Trump and his plans for an expanded border wall or popular among GOP voters here including Latinos\nYou know the idea of the Latino voting this monolithic boat that moves in a single direction really isn't true the highest rate of Hispanics Latinos and in Arizona the last several years have all been Republican and a lot of Hispanics in Arizona who are here legally\nTend to be some of the strongest advocates for border security so\nThey don't respond or that knee jerk fashion that if you're secure borders that means you don't like brown people\nSo crowd scoffs at the idea that Latino candidates like trailer is could draw enough new voters for Democrats to win\nThis is a Republican state there's going to get crushed\nFirst a fundraiser was driving the dozen people can trust us questions about mass incarceration children in foster care and immigrant families in detention contrasts response that her role as state attorney general is limited but she'll do what you can and joined other attorneys general in their fight against the Trump Administration\nI think the bottom line is that this is a moment where I'm running for attorney general\nThis is one line on your ballot\nPeople in Arizona right now are choosing what version of Arizona they believe in and we'll be in Arizona where we come together where we are fighting for one another for the enemy in Arizona that this person than\nFor a longer period of time\nSome polls show that Arizona attorney general race as tight others give the Republican candidate a clear at if contrasts wins

from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate the cases as a matter of fact they have and uh the\nSituation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of\nA legislation for protecting intellectual property but over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly now enforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving the big exception is in trade secrets\nHas remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving the big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it and the U.S over the years have worked with the Chinese and capacity building\nIn other areas of the pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier\nUm but uh but we're all working on it still is threats that comes with trade secret theft is a security threat an economic one or both\nWell I Would say uh in in the case that we are reading about this alleged ministry of security person it's it's both um in most of the cases in which I was involved it was really most economic your technology has been stolen\nAnd products like yours\nAre being produced um and so your market share will shrink\nPresident Trump's been really vocal about China stealing us intellectual property and presumably this has been happening for a while or way before Trump is the problem getting worse or is it just that President Trump has decided to be more vocal about it than previous presidents\nThe latter I don't see that the problem is getting worse [noise] uh and in some ways I think this trade friction that we're uh we're now in the middle of this [noise]\nUm I think that the real crux of this issue is reciprocal treatment or E. S. I. P. violations have been going on for a long time and the U.S has talked with China for years about this\nBut we have never before applied pressure\nYou know I feel that we've had this grand bargain with China for a long time in which\nUm we knew these things were going on and we would talk with the Chinese about it and yet we wouldn't apply the leverage because we were also benefitting from the relationship we were getting less expensive good consumers were happy companies were making money even political leaders\nTheir voters were getting\nChip we were getting less expensive good consumers were happy companies were making money even political leaders\nTheir voters were getting a less expensive product and stretching dollars and it just came to a tipping point and and so now we're applying pressure\nUh so I think the approach that we're taking we have to the U.S that is has to come with the idea that OK you've been doing these things but we have been more or less complicit because we really didn't apply pressure until very recently\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the nonprofit American Chamber of commerce in China he's been speaking to us from Beijing thanks so much\nThank you\nMore now on the strained business relationships between Chinese companies and the U.S only this story is mostly about the effect of tariffs on American workers\nA few years ago Massachusetts wanted to make a big order for new subway cars for the Boston area but there was one stipulation they had to be made in Massachusetts enter the Chinese runaway rolling stock corporation or see our our seat the company won the contract and build a factory about a hundred miles from Boston\nWell that was before the new trade war between the U.S and China under President Trump\nNow the future of the factory and it's a well paid workers is in doubt Adam Reilly from our partners here at W.
