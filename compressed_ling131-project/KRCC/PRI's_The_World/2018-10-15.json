[noise]\nHis research led him to the third character in the story my name is ... ... is an astronomer he's retired now but he used to work at the University of Iceland\nAnd are treated much pressure to use the effect of the sun on youth\nAnd he told them it was true the Arctic Circle is moving and that's because the axis of the earth is moving slowly racking up and down between twenty two and twenty four and a half degrees foreseen says this movement happens in a predictable cycle\n... for two thousand years twenty thousand years in one direction joined your toes and use ...\nIt's called ... and it changes the amount of the planet that goes into total darkness and total daylight every year when the earth's axis gets closer to straight up and down the Arctic Circle shrinks when it gets more tilted the circle spreads out\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away grim Z is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd not drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you would have noticed when you're right\nHabitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle and not drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is that it was assigned the maid of honor them in Yemen dots where the unload the tourist up there and they were walking around the slide and get the message if it goes and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores team told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nIt's heading north to leave the island and looking for the show one of the things you could religions or not you know\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from who's older than usual this is true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to me sick\nAnd ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place or they could let this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument says you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is changing so\nOften and he's only move so we had lots of different ways of representing its moments in Russia is crystallized into something as simple as a sport because it's something you can move around it also represents what we're all\nBecause everything that we're talking about thinking about is actually affected by balls\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much grins he is a really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presence of certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realized that has to be big enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms\nIn diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us you know there was using that we realize they have to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms wrote it and even if five people linked ... it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow unlike now even though we noticed going all the summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction moon has one of her to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\n... are you going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on ... said this\nWas a group as one factor comes into the news from people remember finger burger who's the movement of the U.S crushed ... produced very eye surgery\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have across and everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nKind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're gonna take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution\nThat this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered\nCould there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now it's happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not trapped more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steve and Kristin chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool\nThis is a more willing to use that information stroke which which is nothing you can touch or see I'm not so interesting about the objectives following this idea\n\nThe ball is the least important about\nThe piece itself is the movement the bull does is it represents a movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world do not work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything will ever know finger children\nThe then it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ... of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave room the island in the year twenty forty seven\nI'm not swim Christian and I go up there with all my friends and kick it into the ocean\n[laughter] Zimmer says Walker agreeing [laughter]\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic the answer anything above the ...\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic the answer anything above
