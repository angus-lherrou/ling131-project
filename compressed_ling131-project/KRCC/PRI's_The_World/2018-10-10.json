attacked the plans of some Democrats to expand Medicare to include everyone Trump called that socialism here's a quote the new Democrats are radical socialist who want to model America's economy after Venezuela which got us wondering about the word socialism and how politicians use is\nPatrick ... theory reports on language for us\nSo people in the right Patrick belong attack their opponents for being socialists what's different than how Trump used the word today\nWas funny you know this in a way there's nothing different from what people have been saying for decades about socialism like basically it was just to stand in for communism right\nNow the summer like politicians on the left or right she embracing socialism you think of Bernie Sanders New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez they identify a social or what a socialist me\nThe Democratic social value for me I Believe that\nMoral society now for the last [noise]\nSo for Sanders a cause of Cortez they use the term democratic socialist what what does that tell us like because it kind of a branding their socialism away from marches revolution and communism as you were saying\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and its way because to somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you know I'm used to hearing about political parties during the Cold War who called themselves socialist or at least they openly supported socialist finally as and nobody was espousing monsters revolution\nI Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist you might as well it's just been a Soviet spy is like socialism was a political third\nRail yeah right I mean even the way Trump used the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy witch hunt so what kind of support that socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support as it happened to us right now\nWell I think we'll get some

socialism has become\nBut there are other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking socialism far more frequently than they used to the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who's a relatively young conservative commentator he was barely alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nAnd they frame socialism as you know the opposite of capitalism\nCapitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialism his dad 'cause socialism is charity not an asset and journey socializing itself is hearing\nAlso mark ... democratic socialist of America on the eve of Donald Trump's election that membership was less than ten thousands today it stands at more than fifty two thousand you know no big but it's growing\nYeah and that's
