in the mid nineties and\nFor some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities after he\nPassed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh\nAnd maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us a story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society Irish and have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation is a state leaders ... drone Iowans of people that were took either but uh but he was heavily criticized us or right is in some way against the party\nYour father was in the inner circle with no oh yeah yeah\nBut uh but he was heavily criticized author writes has in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported their revulsion or part of the ...\nBy the late ... of course have being kicked out or from the party has untied revolution and uh spend about the ... year some ... not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public\nSo the memorial how did that memorial first and they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flak [noise]\nIt's very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution by the time I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which\nYou know it's me against his will so I made that argument has had to read them need covers out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said to your father doesn't just being onto your family\nYou know which is very good argument and they say a recent belongs to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a ... for me and say insulting to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece on red but I think it was this a Hummer and a hundred and cause that sickle sickle yeah on it for me it's brutal [noise]\nHurts me and then there were the flowers flower as in this kind of ceremony the I'll use the same set of a paper flowers you know\nIf someone used then the next day a week later somebody dies they oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel a no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I said I Will buy fresh ours my father's point his art has seen the he heath life a civil war much relate to the highest aesthetic document and the moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so they send out a A R people bought all they'll fly to Florida in Beijing city wow I Know they made a fresh for bad so he can\nSleep in the middle but still covered\nCity wow I never made a fresh for bad so he can\nSleep in the middle but still covered by this ride blankets\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed teaching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earn and you were photographed smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time\nWas your intention to shake up the Chinese public no\nIt's not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger is\nJust so sad that survey ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm Me grow older you know [noise] and the U.S individual in this society what I was kind of do I mean it's just give out the opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't really sinks outweigh you know on the surface things on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights\nBut deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family Brecht yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nEnd of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have power to accept the difference still have an allergy or do young enough to take the challenge and\nTo have power to accept the difference still have an allergy or\nDo young enough to pick the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then there will push people way they'll blame other people and it just shows that we can is\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here you're going to turn your eye and your critics toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe I'm to the u._s.\nI always protect a basic rights of freedom of speech and uh humor I I don't see that the only as a Chinese problem as universal problem\nI weigh ... thank you very much for your time it was an honor and a great pleasure to meet you\nToo thank you nice to be here\n[noise] check out my selfie with I way way

R. G. [noise]\nSo this gives us an indication of\nHow much of the fall is frozen or not frozen ... is an eco system ecologist and she's in researching Arctic plant here an obvious go Sweden for the last six years\nShe hasn't pushed the probe into the soil very far at all before it hit something something that sounds like a big rock that she pulls a pro back out and then if you touched this\nIs really really call them back and shrimp\n\nJust a few seconds or the end of the poll has become so cold that it's uncomfortable to touch it's almost eerie like get picked up a message for us from the hidden world right under our feet the world a permit fry it can be anywhere from a meter to a kilometer sick it can be very very cold or just barely frozen\nAnd all around the Arctic it's starting to thaw\nYou might have seen some of the pictures roads that are sinking and buckling homes shifting and cracking and trees tilting an awkward angles giving rise to the label drunk and forests in fact there's a line of telephone poles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them will to little drunken too\nIn fact there's a line of telephone poles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them a little drunk and to\nThat one that is kind of tilting now that is probably standing in an area where the ... just disappearing out so they will have to redo that soon\nFor people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store food it becomes nature's freezer now people can't always trust that their food won't spoil\nAnd thawing permafrost affects all of the newer kinds of infrastructure to not only buildings but water mains sewage dreams even cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shifts beneath them but ... says permit process important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago\nAnd the material in the ... is that old like it it's made out of materials from plants that use to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the pill like out of the freezer and start sauce\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere\nUm because my grandfather eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing basically and then they emit\nCarbon so it's micro breath that we have to worry about basically\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn up a basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them backup\n[noise] back at the lake\nDown but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds and backup\n\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe the way we make them floated spy or even poodles things from using swimming pool\n[laughter] so you take your phone will turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases and bubbling up from the lake below\nMatilda wrote us up to another child and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe and his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas\nSo what's your middle leaders of gosh so this used to be ... intellect sediments\nA word for him to bubble and the global travel through the water into our trip out in the search they likely captured a mixture of gases most of which are well look we don't we're not sure so we used to love from the measure the actual construction\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubble traffic on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of a multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon book store tearing the firm for us we're trying to actively to figure that out [noise]\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nHere's enough that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does\nNo analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop for not [noise]\nIf you have warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there's\n... a very says that in many parts of the Arctic permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon and in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really traumatic for consequences\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think about how much it you know if that's all it does if he had to pull it back it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving species because if it gets much warmer\nLike the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat\nAnd where we live is just not adapted to that\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment for conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise]\nSo we have an ability to stop [noise] of course we do we have choices [noise]\nI think especially ... and the truth we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd [noise] one of the ways is to try and understand his experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here\nAnd the other part is acting on what we already know which is
