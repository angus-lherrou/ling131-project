nurturing skilled nursing facility university park care center CEO dot com\nOr mark a worm and you're with the world the difference between one and a half and two degrees Celsius doesn't seem like much but in terms of the global climate and how it impacts hundreds of millions of people around the world it means a whole lot\nScientists have been looking at how we might keep the warming of the planet to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd researchers who just put out a new United Nations report on climate change say that goal it's still possible but limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius or about three degrees Fahrenheit would require huge changes to transportation land use an urban infrastructure that are unprecedented in human history we really\nNeed to start working very hard right from know if we're not going to see the options slip away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler here to tell us more about it this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be\nWell hard as you mentioned the report's authors hundreds of them wrote that's Freddy inter governmental panel on climate change said there's quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emission in just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it basically means that we have to reduce carbon emissions enough by twenty fifty that anything we ... we can then sucked back out to the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half Celsius and to Celsius in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nThose are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius what sort of thought of as this kind of goal but in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nation that really vulnerable\nAnother step so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half Celsius and to Celsius in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius with sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nation that really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor assemblyman real Huck was one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more and dishes target written into that taxed\nAt that time it was more of a moral argument that we wanted to save all the people on the planet and love just some people on the planet but what we have no is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much damage to he's going to be to the whole world is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report spelled out some really significant differences even though one point five and due to read don't sound like that far apart for example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more people would frequently face extreme heat waves\nA natural habitats would shrink for a lot more animals\nAnd coral reefs would be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou twenty fifty is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change kinda depressing where's the hope in this report\n[noise] well I think people like selling meal Huck and Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time\nI Would say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that\nAnd also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that ... target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people\n[noise] the world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connections between climate change and economic growth the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer\nAnd also that this report that so thoroughly documents the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that more and dishes target which I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a policy that by a lot of people\nThe world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connections between climate change and economic growth\nThe royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic and pressing economic issues of our age\nNorth house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models for failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak out with your fellow winner William nor does\nNo I haven't I just wrote one of his but like a nephew hoping that I could find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and an exceptionally decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr an art house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in not the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat\nWhat Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans has been the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element in what we do [noise]\nYou know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing exclusively on climate change but you know I'm very supportive of that work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be technological progress\nAnd the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encouraged apt to go tackle history important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at the discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about\nThe one who's focusing explosively on climate change but you know I'm very supportive of that work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be technological progress\nAnd the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encouraged apt to go tackle this very important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at that discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... and ... with climate change there is a very simple\nModel that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but the\nTruth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems\nAnd the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work it was much later that physicists came along and then then thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like thermodynamics led to the invention steam engines steam engines led to the dynamics there was a\nReal advantage to creating incentives for start ups and firms to go out and try and make a business in this area\nAnd so I think both bill and I would recommend a kind of attacks on\nSay carbon based energy sources you need to use government policy to unleash this machine for discovering\nWhich is the modern accounting professor what's next for you\nI went to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit but I was a summer funny sixteen\nYep yep that for me was a real red flag there were many things going on there were still trying to understand that part of what was going on is there a lot of people who basically said if the economist or for or against it so if a whole lot of people say if a ton of us are for or against it\nIt's a story about ... the huge red rock in the middle of Australia that sacred to aboriginal people it's also known
