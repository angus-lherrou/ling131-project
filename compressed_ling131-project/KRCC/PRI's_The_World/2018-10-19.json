I Know that there are also a Salvadorans and I think a lot of moments are also joining\nAnd most of them say they are leaving because there's simply no opportunities and also just intense violence that affects their everyday lives that talked to a woman this morning who said her husband had been murdered three months ago and and her story is not unusual\nSo aside from the stories of violence what else are you hearing from some of the migrants I Know you've had the chance to speak with some of them\nThey know what's really stood out to me is that this is not something that most of the migrants plans what they say to me is they\nWhat's really stood out to me is that this is not something that most of the migrants plans what they say to me is based on the news or they saw on Facebook that the caravan was passing and they said we're going to take this chance\nOr in the case of twelve year old Mario ... who I met on the road traveling alone he said he saw the caravan passing by any decided to join\nA little\nGame by getting yeah this is talk on last head we ... you know\nIt's but it's like I got most of that coming up the until the cause of climate change for the military that still head on the world\nThe world is supported by as low business banking redesigned by entrepreneur is for entrepreneurs with digital tools to run your business including built in in voicing mobile deposits and online account set up\nTo learn more it as low A.

five twenty west Colorado who gives a scrap Colorado dot com\nI marker woman you're with the world the story what happened to the missing and presumed dead ...\nThere's a scrap Colorado dot com\nI market where men you're with the world the story of what happened to the missing and presumed dead Saudi journalist ... continues to unfold how it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now\nBut sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTo learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall assembled bureau chief for the New York times so Howard took visuals getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening [noise]\nUm what happened was that the first week the Turkish\nOfficials 'em all anonymous ... not to be quoted started reaching out to foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was that am they want it to be listened in the west they want it to be believed [noise]\nSo um it's been said they'd be they'd be cautious and careful with how they have released um what they know the details coming out by drip I'm In a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in\nWays there's no full now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ... one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his apple watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical X but I'm the photos that were released of the fifty and Saudis who are being accused of being the ... scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in Neal and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source material social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable from a you know the entourage of uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mom had been someone they caught on [noise] um you know photographs news agency photograph so those\nUh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman they caught on um you know photographs news agency photographs so those sort of things we will to match up there are others that it's difficult to walk out who they are\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went arrived in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this was a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against our own government and president I'd run himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although there's certain diplomatic different as they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the program columnist quite a lot of anger spilling out jumped to clearly and demands that um the crown prince be removed so it's it's got going very high\nCarlotta Gall the New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us pleasure to be with you\nMm\n\nHurricane Michael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places that took a direct hit tend to air force base in Florida to do just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise] met over the ripped off at building in the air force base and one through the air is is like Fifteen for [noise]\nThe wind also smashed buildings in ... and flipped over fires it's for roofs off of airplane hangar and damaged after twenty two stealth fighter jet worth more than three hundred\nAnd piles of lumber conflict over cars it's for roofs off of airplane hangar\nAnd damaged esque twenty two stealth fighter jet worth more than three hundred million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the cause of climate change will be going for it\nNot strong konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change at all their installations Brian ... wrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency\nWith its important to capture the distinction between the normal maintenance repair versus the closer Coolidge other severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof and you know how much you've spent repairing hangar roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather class by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that statement was correct\nTrevor how there is with the economic research company ... group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change\nBut they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more ... during a hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agent\nWith big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nRight down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is at a given building a experiences extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag goes\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them washed then you know half of a wing of wind up sixteen fighter\nDepartment of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facilities to address whether an environmental conditions but climate change planning doesn't have that specific budget line however they say they're currently reviewing their climate resilience policies for the world Carolyn Beeler\nCruel asking them their assets since they had seriously nasty and selling to provide houses details meant they had to pay the highest rate five here as a day or child for the school meals\nFamilies would also required to pay two hundred and ten years per child each quarter for the school bus and many obviously grilled afford to do so with talking about migrants who sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten years\n[noise] so what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how to get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing ... she's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution\nAnd convinced they were totally aware my grandchildren will ... being forced to eat separately from their classmates there was these older load that prevents Keats from bringing their own food from home inside their class obviously it was a problem for their parents\nBecause they were forced to take their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back so they had to do\nIn the morning than some of them were checking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back so they had to do back and forth from the house to school like three or four times a day to provide their kids some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\nThere was a reporter for ... for money Patty and TV program for first reported the case\nAnd they went to low income from that some of the seats in ... asking them what do you think there is a new show\nAnd you know what they were pretty happy with it because they proceed migrants invaders but things are different you know after a few days when the news got huge need ally\nAnd as I say a ... support that there is that they should but then when he figured it out that a massive cruel finding to help the migrant kids had already and raise\nSixty thousand euros he said that a ... of assets that being an off to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way [noise]\nYes there is a decision as being described as an apartheid as a form of segregation or that he's the feeling\nThat we are going seriously to fire that think ... are now studying to seeing that you know this is probably the most far right goberman since the end of the world war second any Italy for sure and maybe in ... you\nKnow for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how the kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother you know nobody she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt\nYou know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed and humiliated by a little sign by politicians were totally aware of the conditions for migrants in low energy\nSo they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration because often they are invisible in equally\nInterior minister Mattel solving supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of Modi also backtracked\nShe didn't know she didn't she say that she will consider a self sufficient\nAs I said has the mayor of Modi also backtracked\nNo she didn't know she didn't she said that she will concede or a cell sophistication of the family at this as a way to guarantee school meals the kids but she said that she will ...\nGuardian reporter ... thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raids looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess visa overstay ... people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their their reason Japan and stake out people you're there with him in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggests there for two in the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says caught at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called a Tylenol shoe guy which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this that Canada border's services agency\nCollaborated with with the producers and actually the Canadian government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations in Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very leery and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton cousin so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in the moon is sort of narrative\nAnd say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with their\nA guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in a minute sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there's a camera you know you're driving down the road and it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face and so everything is blurred out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably can plane in ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's spaces voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is it a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they leave I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\n[noise] well I mean yeah at least on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said our age rating those into the entertainment\nLike why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess they'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about ah people from other countries have a they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think it's just a kind of a ... kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended up by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing [laughter] yeah I mean I I guess\nShow theme song ended it by getting sampled all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country is so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Thompson Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show\nOh You're welcome was great to talk with you\nAnd\nChanging leaves and climate change that's just ahead you're on the world\nSupport for the world comes
