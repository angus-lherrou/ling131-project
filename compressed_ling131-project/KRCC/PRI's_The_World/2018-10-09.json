and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nEric told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with what\nWe had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy's at this guy so we now know his real name is Aleksandr Michigan but before he was ... he was on his Alex honor Petra which was his cover it and it says you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise]\nI'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information or discover identity from Israel identity [noise] so we looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are linked um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're linked databases\nFrom driver's licenses and ensure and stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you just know where to look and say we cross referenced everything we could find and we found that ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth dates and it's from roughly the same delegation of middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little ... finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ before he went to medical school yeah he would be a DJ at a local club one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity Michigan\nI go to say some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seem to have to put your cells in the ...\nUm before he went to medical school [laughter] yeah he would be a DJ that to the local club the one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village so we once these hunters and these databases across represent a tiny bit of information we think would probably max the true identity of Michigan\nI go to see some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seemed to have to put yourself in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of a mini vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these guys have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so\nYeah I mean yes maybe some of this is kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for in interesting details cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy lifted his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license the address of the you know ... the equivalent of the CIA\nWell he did it because I'm you know if it gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found is three hundred and five men\nAll between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nYou all have the same register to address this one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address who's I guess I Want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over for drunk driving or speeding the copies let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the owner abilities of how we're able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange slumping us so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and has
