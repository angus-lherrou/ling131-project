of our country's defense is by people hacking into them it's a size five scenario but it may not be that far from reality that at least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the

systems themselves name\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing\nWow so so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just\nThat they found beef fault passwords hadn't in changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing passwords in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases the DOT\nWeapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nI think the biggest

Ontario for a very long time\nOur family has been on this piece of land since Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduated college thirty seven years ago today each of his three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watches twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures throughout\nThe caller that they have\nOn them [noise] his id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures for room in the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well\nIt measures are lying down time and measures her activity\nCombine that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump's\nCandidate does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and as part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much but that's growth in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us\nAnd that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump\nCanada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and it's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much for its role in the ... income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts that don't know and so\nIf we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got injured fed that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently redefine some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada bar from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time or sold an extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin\nWell us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture we have no right to do that I I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system\nThe U. S. government sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it's I think it's I don't remember exactly as like Graham Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nThe U.S sour cream tariffs is one hundred and eighty\nWe have no right to do that I I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets the minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it so I think it's I don't know exactly it's like grand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nThe U.S sour cream tariffs is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us dairy tariffs on other cheeses and now you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process [noise]\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what\nHappened is lunar her a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farm or see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo Canadian markets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario mhm ooh\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the

speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison\nTaken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside Saudi Arabia for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs also a tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent journalists because there isn't anything called independent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like a for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there\nWere like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist\nWas covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these\nThings we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government as healing with everyone right now they are shutting down even my oldest of comments and critique about\nTheir policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman um\nCame I Can't lose her absolutely on everyone I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform and Saudi Arabia\nLearn to walk us through what happened yesterday after the Soyuz rocket launch\nEverything started off completely normal they took off from the buccaneer cause me

the buccaneer causing a drone in Kazakhstan at\nFour forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that something had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up\nIn flight and that initiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in at a much steeper angle when you land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start doing I Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the ... century and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment this time and during the ... experience extra jeeze and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular sways rockets so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNow the U.S and Russia\nAnd so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters innocent our core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNow the U.S and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter no it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually day got up there and just the way as as well and the Soyuz capsules can't last forever and orbit they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long\nSo either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\n... senior science reporter for the verge thinks learn things for having me this

Russians pictorial Moscow's interest\nAnd a half to come down scene or Russia could possibly launch an anti science capsule and send out up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to
