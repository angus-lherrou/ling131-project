S. means automatic citizenship we talked about that and the fourteenth amendment yesterday today we want to spend some time exploring different ideas about citizenship\nLet's start with a simple documents that is a powerful symbol of citizenship a passport\nOutside your home country your passport can dictate easy travel or blocked access because not all passports are created equal the world's ... starts us off\nIt takes a lot of courage to leave your day job to travel the world it takes even more courage if you're not rich and you hold an Iranian passport ten years ago that's exactly what ... did\nHe quit his job at the physics teacher intent on cashed out his savings and became a full time travel they're making a bit of money along [noise] part has tended huskies in Siberia [noise] he's played design of only locals in Zimbabwe [noise]\nAny stronger traditional slow he needs to look at Mount Kilimanjaro\nNow\nThat I was with him on that trip is a friend [noise] today plus I make a living by organizing and needing budget friendly toward for small groups of Iranian when choosing a destination he tells me the first question on his mind is how easy is it going to be to get a visa\nMore times since one about a month plus port mug for many years that they say you ... ...\nUnfortunately my house or to the huge by a gigantic mountain he tells me he's speaking from his home in ...\nUh all the time how do you put on this I thought about Bush's about among you though that a\nLot of people the board passports evokes movement travel but for me he said it's the opposite is that reminder of hardship and pain just got me thinking how does an Iranian passports compared to other down I test\nGot me thinking how does an Iranian passports compared to\nAudit down I've passed Venezuela I've passed St Vincent\nOn hold up under ... she's the author of the cosmopolitan the coming of the global citizen it's a book about citizenship and passports about the world\nOf course that could all change under Donald Trump\nThe U.S go change on the on the Trump ... and this is why we as Europeans look with so much\nInterest in so much ... of what's going on in the United states and to really hope that your lightest stage or would not go down that way that imperial Germany went down being overconfident over its capacities and ah being overly enthusiastic\nAbout its wrote in the village\nBurn up hot so political scientist at the Technical University of Dresden thank you very much for the pleasure talking to you oh\nYou're tuned to the world [noise]\n\nLocal news on Ninety One point five to your so you see the numbers from twenty six team showed the sector surpass the entire US Economy in GDP the survey is part of a large undertaking by the city forestry department southern Colorado's NPR station\nNow you can have the Ninety One point five care cc newsletter highlighting the weeks local and national news delivered to your inbox every Friday morning sign up at care C.

Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that\nEverybody here and there is in their respective camp and it's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp all the other and have a very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think this is science of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and that just quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely\nI may pay Trump's support as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariffs wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nIs a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group they're primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China is not buying their crops the down by bad\nEarly amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though John or is not buying their crops the down by bad twenty five percent and returns\nThough prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which make two other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon begin to have another habits makes you not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal total Cole was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride and but you usually motivates what people's biting intentions are going to be\n... have you ever seen a dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in a strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and\nIt usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and ... but people in tourist dependent electric with voting for her and sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was ... votes of Thanksgiving sometimes just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're gonna have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue light that's coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from American vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed that I felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters and restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such\n[noise] sort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view\nComing from a president does somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to try and we have compulsory ... taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we die hard but as trying to take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics and astray or it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time\nIf you're a pep compulsory biting your politician industry you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nOr you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either the major parties on anything in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go we're hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides were saying this remarkable energizing I'll be very surprised if we don't say ... to me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote as oppression\nThat that has had over the effect and that there's been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there and one of the things we're doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump in the priorities that he has and they basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back\nAlready said he has and they basically say that totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I Want to be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce ... is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of what he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair but at the same time\nA new story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk and the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those\nAnd it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid out for me what is your take on the on the tone brings up by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now\nAnd this gets back to what we talked about earlier in values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders\nWhatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers I expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at all when you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to\nBut I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other [noise]\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth and reality thank you very much for being with us you know
