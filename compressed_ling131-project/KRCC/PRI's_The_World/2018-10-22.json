Kahn in Mexico city wrote about he bought it for the guardian we reached her via Skype\nThere is no one else like Monday vodka and women's soccer in Mexico you know she has helped so many of the young women who are comment you try and rational football in this country comes through\nShe was born in and get a couple of times as\nMany gays in back on the phone you're anti or why not and was you know football mad she loved football she and ran a beauty shop alone and she used the money that she will not be snatched to stop the fast amateur team but that was never enough she always trying to I'm making soccer professional in Mexico\nIn two thousand and fourteen she convinced that Tijuana club the show laws to not have create a female soccer team in the short lives\nAnd and not what the best female professional soccer club in Mexico\nAnd like what is her back story why would this woman go to such lengths taking proceeds from her beauty salon to support women's soccer or I mean did she plays a girl\nShe did say he said and soccer and she played basketball and she always find to to his house with a ... you know she justice obsessed they stuck I like\nYou know not not said guys oh lots of women are too and she just rent to women's soccer being a professional sport in Mexico there's such a long time she never gave up and that Jane and that's what she instilled\nThat what she still didn't have play as I Do not give up ... a guy for them I Believe in you you can do at\nWhat barriers do girl's face in Mexico if they want to play sports\nTo occupy any space that is considered to be a male space is difficult you know whether that be sports politics and then be sort of public space girls have a huge body is it is an extremely much is their country and\nBe sports politics and then be sorted public space girls have a huge barrier is it is an extremely much is their country and\nI think and go from one to play soccer often insulted as being I'm gay lesbian gay and lesbian you know I think it's just an assumption that they do in a male seeing so they can't be more women and girls you know so I think that the not huge barrier\nTo either the column for all girls and women who want to play cycle typical Mao sports\nAfter coaching and to want to you bought a also started a foundation dedicated to women in soccer I mean could a ... he bought his death be related to her work as an activist for women athletes in Mexico\nIt could be and I mean the way that had buddy was last in a public place with ... you know to be a beacon of torture suggests some so to try and make you by by hate\nAnd when a public figure who is tight such an important part in ... women's rights because ... women's suck up all night and when the sport is\nPart of a bigger context for making women's light when such a high profile it's ... it's a message to all of a message to all of the pie as well as the women involved in that professional soccer hey\n... women in general you know that we can kill anyone we can kill anyone ... famous you are no matter how important you know\nA nice day studies meaningful and also it changed everything they can and injustice that my dad got a\nReporter and you know the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered\n... thank you very much for telling us about murder bear no problem thank you it's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance\nAnd suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... for the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than than it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy\nLose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms in security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deals and made under Obama\nWe'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed and it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory or things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's\nFor our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to\nArm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that this contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nThere was some thing here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages\nSo not all of us have gone through but at fifty fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money is already slower than started delivering the fifteenth so the\nMoney is water under the bridge since it's already been spent we're not going to see it again it would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and then you have to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts they would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about ...\nComedy depends on defense goods and how much of that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that has weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say\nSo it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginalized it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people and the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nIn both ... heads the ... circuit polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage but she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lid all along this part of the coasts and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing but\nAll of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away\nOver time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah tap island so this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year that's Joel climate again\nWorst case scenario of course is a storm comes at a enforces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department he set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change\nHis breath and other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions but the sticking point was money moving a whole town is a complicated inexpensive affair one federal study pegged the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant programs blowing up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because of ... you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a whiff of climate change to it has to stop\nThen a few months later Clinton got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about\nClement found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there are in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's gonna happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on our own\nRight and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond\n\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else no more fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think it's just\nHorrible sauce everyone I met in ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together\nPeople here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essentials of life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends on keeping those relationships intact\n... or ... or ... for an
