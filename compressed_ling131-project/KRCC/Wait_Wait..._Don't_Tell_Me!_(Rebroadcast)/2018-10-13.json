talk to you and they let you know that you are going to get worked forty hours right where your character they didn't actually kill any actors as far as I Know\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you kill off someone's oh blah blah blah\nWhich seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traced back to the actor\nI got up to him\nHe tried he tried to get credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know who's right from the front as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which I about a nurse who had a among other things a drug problem and various other problems\nHave you ever like wanted to just
