Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene each month NPR and Kaiser Health news took a close look\nAt a medical bill that you've sent us today we're going to hear about an unexpectedly expensive bill for a

she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to live bomb neo spore and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive

capsule many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it\nWinston left and then came back two days later\nAnd they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nDidn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder ... does it have the top of the line Bluetooth stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have

the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief or partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWith a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an\nExpensive place to live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that\nSolid data that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nHow could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read to help out of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge\n... voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to the judge had to remind him and the people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's the central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader whose confident in on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's the rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that he has a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are certainly that poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more about social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGas is a site that proudly promotes free speech it was that it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white\nProudly promotes free speech it both that it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist\nRobert Bowers was a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society a group that supports refugees\nHe set the group quote likes to bring invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in Andrew tour but it's the c._e._o. of gab in an interview with NPR he defended the platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nBut I don't what what would you expect us to do with both like that where you would you want us to just censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing huh well I run into summer and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nHorner thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now ... Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed as certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says ... is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional Kramer's intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want the citizens to be irresponsible with their speech she says last year Google band gaps up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month just in the last\nDo your Google band gaps up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab CEO Andrew ...\nIs not backing down we're not going anywhere ...\nSays gap condemns the shooting but he thinks it's now being targeted unfairly over the weekend the social media site was filled with anger some of it directed at the Jewish community Jasmine Garsd NPR News\nSo that was over the weekend and then last night job released a statement saying it would be accessible for a period as a transitions through new hosting provider [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nAll things considered from NPR News is like a high powered telescope every afternoon resume in on what's important around the world\nThe country's finance minister Sri ... chokes back tears\nAnd that night and said I Am that if you lie and add\nShe confirmed it was on the officials from her ministry were on board the ill fated flight\nThey were flying back to the island among cup attend mining region the transport safety committee said determining the cause of the crash would have to wait until the recovery of the cockpit and flight data recorder known as the black box\nThe chief executive of line air said we are also confused about why since it was a new plane and the privately owned carrier so the aircraft had only been in operation since August\nBut the airline has had a mixed safety record\nEarlier the U.S and the ... you had banned lion air from operating in their airspace but both lifted the restriction in twenty sixteen Seventeen thousand islands air travel in Indonesia has rapidly expanded\nAnd with the lion air the budget carrier aggressively invested in a new fleet featuring Boeing's seven thirty seven max\nIt's a more fuel efficient version of the manufacturers were course single aisle jet today's accident is the first\nSeven thirty seven max it's a more fuel efficient version of the manufacturers workhorse single aisle jet today's accident is the first report it to involve the widely sold Boeing model Julie McCarthy NPR News manila\n[noise]\nThe the time to watch the world series I saw a couple of the games on TV I saw part of that Eighteen inning game ... watched game for with a Peter cycle of NPR's wait wait don't tell me to a\nGame for was one of the Dodgers took a leave it looked like they were on their way to to time in Syria totally and instead the Sox came back they won that game and then they walked away last night having ended the series in five games\nYeah ... are very happy celebrating in Boston and those fans included Joao Silva era\nYou know I Wish they trying to finish it at home I Do [noise] they said he would have been saying well we got the parade coming up this week I I'm just a static right now I'm ecstatic as soon as\nWow jet red Sox pitcher David Price me a lot of just one Ron Sachs one game five five to one\nFirst baseman Steve Pearce led the fence and raised the MVP trophy you hit a two run home run the first inning last night and then a solo homerun the AIDS\nFilling my life ah you know what you are you going up wishing that you could be part of something like this and within that special group of guys out there to celebrate with them was awesome\nFor Dodgers fans here in LA for the second year in a row it was just so close [noise]\nThis is NPR News outstanding\nAchievements of young professionals aged forty and under who live or work in Colorado Springs we recognized as did the annual mayors young leader awards ceremony October thirtieth at the Colorado Springs pioneers museum more information on the community counter Lincoln care C.\nC. dot ORG\nWords ceremony October dirty of up to Colorado Springs partners museum or formation on the community killed ...\nDating it's hard but using dating apps is pretty easy to see a picture and swipe right for yes left for no oh no bad shoes wrinkle shirt not my type it's a very rapid\nFire like ... now that swipe is in question fumble and tinder are fighting a legal battle over who owns it that story plus the last week of campaigning before midterms this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nThat it today at three thirty on Ninety One point five K.

decision to step aside signals the beginning of the end of Merkel's political career and tenure as the most powerful woman in European politics NPR saw riots or hunting Nelson as one of our correspondents based in Europe she has covered much of Merkel's political career and joins me now has ...\nGood morning David so significant moment here ... speaking to the nation about her decision what what is your saying\nShe she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nOr that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith in her government um and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nWell I feel like you and I have talked um countless times about medical and some of the challenges and then calling her times embattled I mean she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in twenty Fifteen rights away the wise why we arrive at this moment now what's different well\nThere's been a steady chipping away at her support uh basically on a national level but also in regional elections is this really dogged her and her party and her allies are especially\nAh the the most recent one we can talk about where last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and ... which is where Frankfurt is the big financial center\nAnd also two weeks the form of area some serious losses where in last night's or the count basically her party barely is hanging on to power with the coalition of greens\nAre and in Bavaria they I mean it's\nLast night's or a the couch basically her party barely is hanging on to power with the coalition of greens are and in Bavaria they I mean it's it's also really shaken up the the the very end allies of of Mrs medical which are uh the the Christian social union members have been very in a ... conservatives if you will\nSo I mean she's been so central to European politics food it's hard to imagine you're paying ... without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this decision\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation does negotiate in that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus\nAnd she's in an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's basically go to remain in power until uh until then but it and she's a lame duck at this point and any talk\nOf who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who she wants on what what political insiders have told various media a is a hurt the city you general secretary unemployed come ... she's fifty six year old\nWho's who's someone who many would like to see take her place but there are also other people like the health minister who is

trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to live bomb Neal spore and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bends or\nPain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic hassle than they do a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came I ...\nSubstances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tapes and plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder six cylinder it's orange and does it have the top of the line Bluetooth stereo system or does it have the more comfortable

includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting the five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nA lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up\nHe's editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King with a lovely\nImage at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nA yeah it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more ... was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to

from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about but he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... for the restoration of national pride and I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo the judge had to remind him and the people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's the central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to

about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do do already\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is
