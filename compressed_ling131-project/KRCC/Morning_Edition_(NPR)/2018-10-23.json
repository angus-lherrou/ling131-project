X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encourage courage\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep much is at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have to process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the\nJust fine are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their batch [noise]\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well\nUh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting Lynn so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will um\nThey had been written look at our constitution as it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ... or a or a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWindy low [noise] they go low\nWe seen what did you mean but what I meant ... in that remark was at a I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forced follows that something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think through votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration and it was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to ask for more is seeing ... gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves\nAttorney general holder thanks so much and I think you

three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million I'm that both astronomical so the odds are basically the same\nJason Kirkland as a lawyer who represents jackpot winners and he says if your office pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office bulls\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's in the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nLived in where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single\nWere to win and that's not all\nMy been above where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're off his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to and I understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that the last

cents is the court has sided with the Trump Administration and temporarily blocked the questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nDozens of states cities and other groups are suing over Russia's decision to add the question which asks census takers if they are us citizens\nAnd here's how long has been reporting on these lawsuits he joined us now from New York morning on the\nMorning to oil so why did the Supreme Court temporarily block a lower order for the commerce secretary to testify for these lawsuits well\nThis is a request from the Trump Administration which has been arguing that these lawsuits should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already release for these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question commerce secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient that there have been inconsistencies in a roast his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is all preparation for a trial that is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country\nAnd at this point the children is ration could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block car secretary Wilbur Ross is deposition\nFor good even as the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen in this trial if that is the case\nWell what is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing over the citizenship question\nIt means that the windows really closing took like additional evidence to support their claims in this lawsuit and it's important remember the Supreme Court did allow last night and this order the plaintiffs attorneys to question the Justice Department official John Gore he's the acting head of a civil rights\nAnd it's important member of the Supreme Court did allow last night and this order the plaintiffs attorneys to question the Justice Department

additional document requests but again we have to see what the ministry nation does next in their next expected requesting Supreme Court and what they asked the Supreme Court to do the for a trial starts\nAnd Hansi when can we expect to find out like the the final fate of the citizenship question\nUltimately these this legal battle is expected to be argued in front of the Supreme Court\nAnd so

vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering\nOr we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blind when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one St Louis\nTeam the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing it\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won the Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made which you lift off a famous remark by Michelle Obama when\nThey go low [noise] they go low\nWe can what did you mean what I meant ... in that remark was at a I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nBroad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out today after the Trump inauguration and it was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to\nAsk for more sane gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves
