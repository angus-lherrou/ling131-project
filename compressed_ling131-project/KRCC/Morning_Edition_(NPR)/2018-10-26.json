to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs are surprises me in a pool as me but um if you were to say that somebody was out to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a set of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived\nBy separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of his finance or being his politics and they live and he left hungry at\nSeventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one\nOf the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million

because it's sort of sorrow and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he has so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as a shadowy you caught expended rushing because actually his so that's called the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes

I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where George finances are portrayed as the shattered me if it goes through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry think of Soros\n[noise] he was a hero early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much\nFun to President Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris is kind of tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major ships in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years boaters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\n...

week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nThere was a controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and who doesn't want to and she wants to look like they interrupt for one day I I don't know how like that got raises hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all you can watch at home than it and just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't ah the only examples um are there are number I remember back in twenty eight and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black he'd group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a sea started criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours at a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was feeling to take it a sufficiently seriously about one more example among several uh she\nA liberal a strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously or one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's The colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something of that and making Kelly's colleague an attitude\nToward her well for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced she accused her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she had to just play some popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik thanks hated you bet\nIt's friday and time again for storing

this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it and just as white she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\n[noise] well these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount

of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the weight and network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are Tyler I in tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as
