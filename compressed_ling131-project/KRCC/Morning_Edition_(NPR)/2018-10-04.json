network germane ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou ask them about their own own thinking how not to push through to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of the crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was a cart remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um we're engaged in political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it's a song or a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in ... states which is just sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort

the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children on may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still maybe a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually ... and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise]\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nUp so much so that you actually tell the story of twins or the girl who was born with the virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this for a job little ... minutes of it to her as she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just thought you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't

school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they're going to do about child care and and\nSo we're able to join um the actress ... she went around ... some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she's kind of giving talks to these women and giving the pep talks interest sort of saying you know you need to write to the man you need to write to the health effects treat telling to give you a bus to tell your child to school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning type of issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his chats how did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much with my little girl a year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little girl and\nHer mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing an Eighteen month Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's got to worry she'll come you know\nBut you can't you know you just don't know where every child different uh ...

itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nFrightened that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in rock or searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only

in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when\nYou were there early in the years shortly after it\nWill Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for you know the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back they what's really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda

dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in rock or searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve\nIt's going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut
