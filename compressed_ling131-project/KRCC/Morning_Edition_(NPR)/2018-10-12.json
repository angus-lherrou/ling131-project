of the Trump Administration and the subject of repeated talks\nAnd attempted high level deals between the U.S and turkey runs in his lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July and parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter\nI Know I told my case this one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him well\nHe's lived for a long time and his mirror in western Turkey's about fifty years old or he ran a small evangelical church there\nBut then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and this cleric that turkey blames for the twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there's some been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president rid of type or to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then and this year he was transferred of house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was

today well the court\nActually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years the prosecutor as for ten\nBut at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a impart taking his health into consideration of the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted and he is now free to leave the country\nAre you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since there's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why was such a big priority for them well\nThe administration is well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S certainly a vice president Pence secretary of state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency are also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions and lifting them\nUh but I have to say this decision is also a big relief for turkey and president ... uh he's struggling
