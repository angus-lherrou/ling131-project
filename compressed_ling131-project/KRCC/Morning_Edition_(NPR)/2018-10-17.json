curls its founder is an American woman named ... she has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on a street selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly its undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission on I think that in a way this is a story about the books\nVictimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with death charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its find or keep the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of\nYeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia or demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie ... and he was using that power according to other girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his ...\nThose kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked when he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\n[noise] well that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him which he's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think is rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnston was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nThat are potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually were willing to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to\nSexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up of an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something's gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has noticed a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nHow what's the process for

curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's more than me up\nBecause she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by pro public at in time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with the charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of\nGift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started up which are the first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kitty ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\n[noise] I never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier [noise]\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of a vigilante group which is a a group of you know community members who are in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was doing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nThere's a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and [noise]\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think is rumors that Johnson had just being in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Duncan was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court\nIt was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with him which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls that are potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up of an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something's gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has noticed a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard what's our process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nAnd but I didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm um they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking

can start with symptoms such as droopy eyelids and difficulties following the CDC has confirmed sixty two cases in the last few months mostly in young children\nSince the CDC began tracking the disease four years ago a total of three hundred and eighty six cases have been confirmed one case was a seven year old boy and his mother Susan coin says her son came down with an ear infection this

extremely lethargic and went downhill quickly\nHe lost total control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have a healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it would be on the horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused the evidence sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNothing ... says given the rising cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as entering virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogens that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response or the arm or like weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it ... pointed out that this is not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these athletes\nSuch is entering virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response or the arm or lake weakness paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that has been almost completely eradicate it nothing you pointed out that this does not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not because of these at them cases CDC has tested every ... from math and patients none of the settlements have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases asked them is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms that Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases and adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child develops sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd those are the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases that following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent to prevent the speed of light\nIn the case of Susan coin San Evan he's healthy again he was treated with steroids Andy was an occupational
