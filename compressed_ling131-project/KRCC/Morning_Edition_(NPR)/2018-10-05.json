saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final comparable\nTo this is important let's underline this this is a vote to and debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh's does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh you're in the final vote which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is so typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now wants his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done on but it isn't written in stone\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line um I Will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people including um you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nDavid Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning I'd go see a you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um and there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president I'm from just about any load of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints\nBut then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how the culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not normal um that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they patched appropriations bills they passed an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how lie all the other side as well still getting just the basics of government on Washington if they can continue to do that or if they fight sours them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to a colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott native it so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to\nTo respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides in both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years except somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nAssault even under the lower standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even worse than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses

a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that were received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interview ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed\nWhat we Senate investigators poring concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know these on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations\nThere also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct\nAnd the same is true of six prior FBI investigations\nAre conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service nothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever being good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominated\nThere is

clear\nThey will never be satisfied no matter how fair and through the process is thirty one years ago\nThe Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork\nOr playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent\nHas become sort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not would probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh's being poor too which is the way the conservatives refer to this Nina Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert barks nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money to spend today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me um but\nBe confirmed a liberal interests did\nHave some ads against him and they were chump change compared to where the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired

NPR continues until ten o'clock this morning that the anticipated end of the coverage looking at the\nProcedural vote in the Senate and It's MORNING deciding whether the process of putting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will move forward stay with us\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress as here and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nThere are four key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close very like forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the ups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides\nBut don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAnd you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but\nHe is there a guy he's their point man he's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that they can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away [noise] ah they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults much

what what\nThey're saying ships at one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days as well we'll talk about that a little bit more moment apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\n... chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset

special interest groups\nFor whom the national interest as a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade\nCutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worsened when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nDiscarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations\nThat judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn twenty eight team\nThe Republican majority conduct at a hearing\nThat made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour at the urging of break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly\nTo a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man\nBut nothing could be further from the truth\nFirst they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf

floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward\nBecause he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats\nWhen it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips\nMerrick Garland\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign\nWhere the politics of personal destruction\nWith his nomination\nIn reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience there and our Republican friends\nAre are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign\nOf engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee\nThey don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings\nLet them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter\nProceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter\n\n\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo me the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there and now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with\nOne of the most consequential votes\nYou ever cast in the Senate\nNow the stakes are always high for Supreme Court nomination\nBut colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all is\nThe United States Senate will also\nBe making a say\nWithin the states\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying and mob intimidation\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nEither give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nSignal that media bullying and mob intimidation\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAlthough signed up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy on Americans live\nOr will declare that our society cannot ... must not will not shut the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long\nFor on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far allowed protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nOr you're fighting against a\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island the whole forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh ...\nJust stop and consider the snap shots\nThe indignity\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse [noise]\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor drought on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\n... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nWas clear that his number one\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination by any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nResistance until the final vote\nFor a few weeks their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jeffers\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\nHustled vulnerable people\nHospital workers\nSame old tricks same old playbook\nThey all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being liberated drowned out\n\nReceived interviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination then for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus opinion which we are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nReceived an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus\nOpinion which\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president they owe taxes weren't working\nOne going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more\nTry something new they said\nWell we all know what happened next\nUncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected tested all they organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's Seventy seven\nInvestigation\nBy any parents that are the facts the actual\nFacts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas produced a support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nNothing will not want enough\nFor our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it right now\nFrom the FBI inquiry\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it right now\nLast August managing die either way mentioned by the way we went to the hearings and sat there for hours of testimony is Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes disadvantages too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that for the magic thumbs down vote no on the repeal of Obamacare\nThis would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen\nMr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin with\nEr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and I do is you see that's right or you can't have a firm since the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator home we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware as the other the Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nJeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the ruins that are that we're in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House\nReally knew he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and it ruins it either in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the bench and a conservative direction for President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only at ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is the correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with that asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski\nWhen we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin is in a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of his state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nAnd he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people or maybe joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex covenant has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nA Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap has a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's survey showed earlier this week that they don't really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a win\nDonald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd\nBeen a doozy has them gap as a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that he really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence seeing that apparent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out voters ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms oh it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole and Republicans are\nUnited and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan to I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "05"}
