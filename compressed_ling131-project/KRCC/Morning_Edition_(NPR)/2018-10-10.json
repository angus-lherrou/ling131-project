Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court prompted a lot of discussion in all corners of American Life about sexual assault and specifically how young men are taught or not taught about consent\nA Jewish organization near Philadelphia has a program to talk about this and other difficult topics with teenagers NPR's Jeff Brady sat in with a group of young men\nIn the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home a half\nDozen high school freshmen boys are munching on chip and ... is thirty five year old group leader Cody greenest introduces the week's topic raise your hand if you've heard of the me too movement he's a volunteer with moving traditions which organizes conversations like this with thousands of Jewish teens around the country\nGreenest leads a discussion about historical power differences between men and women and how that can play out when they get them\nTo say do we believe that\nVerbal consent as necessary\nBut one of the boys David Levin says it\nWhen it comes to say do we believe that\nVerbal consensus necessary\nBut one of the boys David loving says it isn't always so simple he describes the situation on a bus where both people already said they're interested in each other and the girl purposely sits next to the boys\nAre there and then she puts a blanket around you to lay down and ... yeah exactly and I cut those ensuing like grabs your hands or you can hold hands and stuff like those are some times you know\nThe boys discuss several different situations and most seemed to conclude that getting verbal consent is the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teens the space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover the tenderness and the connection and the joined themselves as a human being and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility\nTalking about sexual assault and consent this way sounds different from what a lot of people heard in the past University of New Hampshire a sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\n... ... and ... and help them you know the capital and they went out and and he made and then we went and got to have

sexual assault and then how to intervene Potter says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already done high anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a

the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like

support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the ...\nIt's on its main products Myrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it or Republican today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal send acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect\nJohn

of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the

behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Burton says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon
