new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with him so he sweat this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division his name as general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign

the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty thousand trapped in their choice in reservoir slog than fought their way is sixty miles to the evacuation portable enough\nTo snow mountain passes they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korean leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to

the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ham on\nWhat we're lose experiences as an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south\nLeave by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what is it been like to be

serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described President Trump fault but with their sexual assault allegations Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to catch that\nThis is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty apparent to the people who usually do those the local police\nWere following it a little bit uh some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so many potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nTrauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means ...\nThe case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances airing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation but\nThat kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar attacks by the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nQuincy Jones a nonstop super producer who's impact on pop music is almost impossible to avoid\n[noise]\nDocumentary tells his story the eyes of his daughter\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nQuincy Jones a nonstop super producer who's impact on pop music is almost impossible to avoid\n[noise]\nDocumentary tells his story the eyes of his daughter Rashida I'm Joshua Johnson will meet Quincy and Rashida Jones next time on one egg for W.

battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nName is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee found to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended\nThe no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe started went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely uh the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house representatives that hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons and that leads to another question Hi this\nRemove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been

George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic in trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve\nEvolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness tuned to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized that thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we

unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially an intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with him so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores

night you may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for I'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than fought their way is sixty miles to the evacuation portable no\nSnow but I think pets as they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korea and leave by silk who was\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and escape to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean

and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she joined her family and and made it to the south\nLead by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons\nAnd launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some

given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check years and is not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nBut with sexual assault allegation Supreme Court\nTo catch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty apparent to the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten in\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nRebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something the FBI is just gathering information for perspective\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case of just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of the semester ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\n[noise]\nOn behalf of all of us here in Ninety One point five care cc thank you for your support during our fall membership drive your financial contributions will ensure that Ninety One point five here see provides accurate news and analysis music entertainment today tomorrow and the day after and could not do this without [noise] thanks\n[noise]\nThank you indeed for supporting southern Cal\nOn behalf of all of us here in Ninety One point five tier cc thank you for your support during our fall membership drive your financial contributions will ensure that maybe one point five ... seats provides accurate and use an analysis music entertainment today tomorrow and the day after we could not do this without your thanks\n[noise]\nThank you indeed for supporting southern Colorado's NPR station Ninety One point five K.
