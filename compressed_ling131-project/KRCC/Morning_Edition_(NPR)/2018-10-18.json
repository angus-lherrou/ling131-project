think it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize cut a center right and Republican voters to come all the fuel and make sure that the male their ballots vote for the Republican ticket\nBut especially with the candidates and their allies sticking to other areas like immigration and health care as well as personal attacks democratic strategist bars says it's hard to say that the confirmation hearings are what narrows that gap\nThe undecided group typically more than they always start to come home or in a round you know we go to Ralph\nIn a debate this week both candidates chose not to weaponize the Kavanaugh fight too much while\nThe president has gone so far as to call for the accusations a hoax mix Sally focused her criticism on Democrats and activists not forward herself\nWe're seeing the mob
