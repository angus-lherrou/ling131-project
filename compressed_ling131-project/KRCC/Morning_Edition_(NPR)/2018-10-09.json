the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client\nUnless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes

proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead to face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff jet standard likes that system he's in Lewiston in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to deal\nThey would have shackles on so their stuff we're going to be half of war we're taking and their belts are going to be chained together so you're walking on the line it's kinda like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take 'em right in the back and put 'em in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera\nHaving a

out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds that video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because of uh

of the screws it's an it's either yes or no sir you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh should explain to the judge what happened to me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison where Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national\nLegal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began\nYou already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for

I'm here now with NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele ... morning Michele mornings so this seems to have come as a big surprise do we know wind Nikki Haley's stepping aside well\nWe're only hearing um bits and pieces of their announcement right now I'm ... ... but I Will say that\nYou know Haley has been spending a lot of less time at the Security Council except for this past month of course which was the big U.N General assembly which has been doing more speeches more appearance elsewhere she already seemed to have been not long for the job\nI'm and she seemed to be kind of\nTrying to keep her her own um\nImage or own a sense of who she is and and as a politician I'm not completely tied to Donald Trump\nThat's interesting so although this may seem like big news for people for people who cover diplomacy it's maybe not the most surprising news\nWell I had been hearing rumblings or a while ago that she was kind of not long for the job and we're in what we're hearing from President Trump today is that he told that she told them six months ago that she wanted to take some time off at the end of after two years in office um he\nIs quoted as saying that he hopes Haley

your pick and so far Haley you know isn't really pushing him aside or criticize him or anything to the contrary she saying that\nOther countries may not like what the us is does but they respected so again she she kind of keeps her distance from Trump but also supports them\nLet's put her in the in the broader context of this administration which has been critical of the United nations on on several fronts how successful has she been at articulating the president's policies and what do people at the un think of her\nYou know ... she is very tough and she went in a very tough saying things like we're gonna take names of people who support us and who don't I'm On the other hand you know she has supported continued payments to most un bodies um\nYou know she wants to do things like a cut back on the amount of money that the U.S is paying but when you know the rubber hits the road she has been supportive of a lot of of things going on at the un\nAnd I think the un secretary general uh has had a very good relationship with her he's a politician to is a former prime minister of Portugal\nAnd he seemed to have kind of a report knowing that you know Haley as a politician of course but also you know when their when their ideas align things like pushing for more efficient a un system\nYeah he can work with her and I think that's that kind of relationship has done a the un well for the past couple of years uh we'll see what happens next\nGiven as you say that there have been rumblings that she may be on her way out do we have a sense of who might be a candidate to succeed Nikki Haley well\nThat kind of relationship has done a the un well for the past couple of years so we'll see what happens next\nGiven as you say that there have been rumblings said she may be on her way out
