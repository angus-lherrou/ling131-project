South Dakota in Eighteen Ninety\nTry our sense frontier soldiers still a lot of innocent because they were ... by the ghost wants a religion based on the vision of the pie you spiritual leader named for Boca\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision\nHe basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can't cheat or steal or drink\nIf we do all these things well then we will be reunited with our loved ones and our ancestors in the after world it was almost Protestant and its its insistence on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dances and the right way and for the right shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meeting all the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seven cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them the next day they move\nMurray stopped spotted outspent sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them the next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre\nYou quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we spare even a ... of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer she said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and why please and paint and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me\nThe most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other one\nWhy you found dairy my heart at wounded knee dubbed\nOn one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point wounded knee was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist well then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared it Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and happens this land nearby off the following three to purchase health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar on of all three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents arrived they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct\nThe whole courtyard was covered with the FBI isn't right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and the tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey wanted to be urban inner fares to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat is right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current is that we have the virus in order to be hurt [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come\nByron in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come violence [noise] might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n\nEnter a serpent and fourteen Ninety two expelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank\nSo much I'm really speaking out to be on the show David

not even unique to Germany in two thousand six and it was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation and election campaigns of many European right wing party in Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front on there's even a terrible for this phenomenon Indian food the ...\nAnd you say that India and the thing is the ads and and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation myth\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources do cry

which throughout the nineteenth century became\nA root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his
