make sure it doesn't uh we do need to reach an agreement to the next few weeks with the EU which is mutually beneficial and not mutually harmful\nAnd all those some voices in Iran governing party a very critical of the prime minister my view is you've got to be a hundred percent behind the otherwise you weaken ... position parliamentary arithmetic is very tight and we'd go we have to pack up all the way to the point where I Hope and what will probably be the last minute hits\nWe ended up with a deal which could determine our future relationship with the emu and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major described\nPoint of all this is that the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside Iran policy if one if one looks at her positions on things like the Northern Ireland backstop which the British Government had\nSigned up to this notion that there will always be a safety net whatever the states that sort of a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the EU that will always be a safety net which ensures that Northern Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them\nGuarantee offered by the British as long as you'd always last December it now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May con get hit by the ... allies in the Democratic union his party no\nUh I think you'll ruin them this uh I didn't think that um she's ah it had been ducking waving I think a great quality is that the reason the is unstoppable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the ... prime minister takes a lot of the incoming fire for many angles are mostly from those who are willing to the re heartbreaks over breakfast or no deal a tool\nBut she doesn't thoughts in what she's doing it she's saying very clearly that ah the union of the United kingdom the full conscious of the u._k. must be held together and that the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom\nNow she has stuck to that problem we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nTo try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the youth and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... you don't quite if I may interrupt just to because we are done by Irish foreign minister Simon company said yesterday they will be no withdrawal agreement without the Irish ... ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May see a ... year position is hit the brakes and tears who appear to have a a means to stall Theresa May from from making any more concessions to Brussels based it over here there is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and not stable to analyze it I'm Simon cave and they use various mobbed\nAnd I'm very thin line did\nEssentially has the same objective as we do which is that we don't want to undermine the northern Irish peace prices we didn't want to ... to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island of Ireland and ... sort of more than it is the ...\nBut the ... the point about Canada plus as it doesn't address the problem it it it's still a problem so you know people can audio lumps themselves and and adult pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way to live at\nThe morgue and a former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party all politics is now on to quote existential strained friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments over bricks at the languages become toxic\nIncluding talk of the Brexit fears of killing his own is for the prime minister carrying on new sitting through a meeting so she could hang on a cell phone nice being turned in her body one on us is going on inside your party\nBut I I think briefings using disgusting language like that and just to be condemned to to me I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party given the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in Britain deal [noise]\nBecause I think that in the next few weeks if the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think when I hang on this is interest\nAnd we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal\nAnd I think when I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have to support shortly up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off\nSome members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think will appeal awful lot of those who are making the noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the the new deal that's on the\nTape and then it will pay check has all of a sort of ...\nIs a that is my belief and I think we should than supported\nI don't see how your party can survive that your former boss ... Morris Jones and\nHe says checkers is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around the British nation you'll respond so that was just one of the most disgusting things that I've heard in ... in politics you said this is the end of Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure which is Lisa I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who\nUsed to work for our new with each other even before this ... deal is put back on the table before parliament as the final deal with Europe you'll ... finish that\nThought is was bigger than the events it has to cope with in the case

see spending is the million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and

and ... do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nCan you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that better Oregon is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way of the most\nVotes in\nEnsuring our forty minutes president Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own

fundraising drawers events like this one\nAnd anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over all may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump after all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research in recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential invoked his\nSo how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies and through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to find all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a camp\nYou'll get more votes but what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race to all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage of the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and it's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to we're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what\nThey do so we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states\nShould expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days\nProfessor government Mike friends separate oil this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we'd do

different it's like okay I don't need to wash my eyes so that it\nWill I be talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers solve the brain training at punt who's findings to the period in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage the hand some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nI'm wants treatments currently exist so there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nThey as psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm\nGoing wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are right there is nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnd also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety another treatment as the selective serotonin ... uptake inhibitors these drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss our eyes drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients are don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training at is more effective what's the thinking behind is well the thinking behind that\nWas the first of all also when you have to do the C B te therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the royal society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself so there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on my behavior\nYes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious so stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBD therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or use a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually there's nothing nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or when I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands\nSo what sort of has have you had with those using this some brain training him\nSo we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the ... for one wakes up they used it for long ago it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction and also it\nAction because they've only use the F for one wakes up they used it for

you know the south China Sea\nNo they haven't so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to whom\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other build some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to work with each other on it\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states is the

getting much much wetter so what we're starting to live through with what they're starting to really know that it's been happening\nWhen it's really dry so for example the summer when it when it was really really dry the biggest challenge that we had was availability of water so we were using water from our wealth to bring to the animals by the end of may beginning of June we realize that the
