I can ... I Believe that I live alone all into the future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThe question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to not so long ago we spoke to a woman code ritual ... who\nIs a white parent age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and and and lived a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black\nFickle debate about who is to say one being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black well\nI think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of the euro and writes all on their own race as a social category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's ... you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system I'm happy I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and joins us as to why do they get as any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt the system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I am asking them the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial do they'll have could have persuaded or it could have made these arguments on the side of the people in began the thing and if you could have done it in the weight of a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something the other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about her but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments and giving it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other things have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job to\nFix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I get that but do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing that was looking for\nFor that I think some things can be said a but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less bigoted and people have done so\n... was like oh this one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less bigoted and people have done so don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among\n'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people have all the major kinds\nAnd do things with them that's not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in your community together work together with people because I think working together with people of diverse identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the falls idealism leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nThe final thought we have a a thinker and rice

a problem of today this care of and it's not the first carbon but definitely put in pension and more pressure because of its disability\nWhat other options on the ... the United states to try to stop so many illegal migrants coming through\nI think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of integration in there are more immigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was five years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a
