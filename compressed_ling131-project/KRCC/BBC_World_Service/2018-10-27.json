that democracy helped elect President Trump and they think that he's going to the corner\nWill actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal park refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that makes\nBut the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that what the people choose doesn't Sharon eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump I'll\nHang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you to prove\nYou know I think it's a good thing when it is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that\nWe are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice now from a supporter of Donald\nTrump didn't do yes I did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nUh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean the descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we like Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community\nAnd by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know I was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nThat will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like the old dining hungry who you mentioned in your book\nWe'll be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim or banning hungry who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day Nate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies route and go to all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions uh collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being you know threatened I think by these people that are you say are you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIt's a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that's democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is democracy in action and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um [noise] the Justice Department and\nI think that if she gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now\nAnd I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions\nGo after all of those in a way to use a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really are built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him to opponents of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity that demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics to black yes\nIt's really interesting isn't it because they're talking about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but we've got some middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other and the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons\nIn terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it\nAnd therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes\nWhich then become uncomfortable then we moved to the middle so that ... that comes to Brian in motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think a Frances so\n... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions has been that um the end of history that western liberal democracy is the way forward to we are not going to do any ... ... ... it's not going to go away\nWe'll even though it's so new indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system that we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it to the manager will fashion the tension that sue spoke about essentially the tension between uh the value system movements\nThey didn't and change it to the manager who fashion\nThe tension that's who spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want to know the value system a is powerful the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most is that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the power base and it is these these people that are hardest by extremists politicians who are anti democratic in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and process but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French one\nProblem assume we're wrapping up in the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of people up you know there isn't the passion surrounding dinner and sort of liberal democracy is up or you know there is um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being a safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ... [laughter] regardless\nAshraf suit black have been a guest on this edition of weekend many thanks to them hope you come back again soon thanks to you for listening we all we can we live from London misses the b._b._c.

of\nI'm not a beautiful ballad kind of has been shifting lay chat a in people's lives of the century has progressed so\nUm it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if there was some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but it's not doing that\nSo you think I thought so cluster up in that you have I don't know ... people dying eighty five Ninety ... not what's happening exactly\nAnd it's not doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell us that the that can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future because we'll still altering but what we can say is it hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on all buddy for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after a certain age or\nMaybe the race it which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nClass now that I was saying when we discuss life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out to him talk with the U.S slowdown in the list and you might expect and one of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and fifty people die from an opioid overdose the people come from all walks of

unless they have clear line of science into a launch vehicle base of electric vehicles who they know that kind of service and also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric vehicles

explained to just how important ... sap has become in Brazil\nWater is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer watts up for free without discounting the Internet data so it's\nIt's a cheap and readily available to an how easy being abused during the present in our actions\nSo we found out that there are campaigns that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook and then use these numbers to a target\nPains that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can just send the message is individually about a candidate or when they put people in lots of groups one markets here who I spoke to was\nTelling me he would put a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be to uh people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is\nJust a little fringe activity or is an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd it was up has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part\nUh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use lots up in Brazil\nAnd uh the far right candidate presidential candidate said for NATO\nOr whose campaign is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook said and Facebook told us it is investigating a the

special guest um it's it's two years ago that we began a space to worry about the impact of social media on elections with the U.S presidential elections um and it keeps on going on in its own was

Facebook's role in this because of course the world's up just keeps on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell some of us will be learning about these kinds of things are moving the is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I think it is and it was and to do the same problem which is how our politicians today going to get their messages across to people on campaign the way that we all socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media\n... the politicians are going to go there\nAnd then you get these questions of well why did they get the data Halladay targeting people the messages\nAre I think things have ... ... but he is having that conversations if you were a political candidate he would also trying to do that now in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nOr to put it kindly to the these are always the question if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and why am I being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nBut I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of highland messed it up paying but across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus\nOn we've seen more ovens this week that was not covering well for instance in fake news the news is sort of a political weapon in the United states more examples of during a whole saga about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's a kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole model is\nEverybody shares with everybody else we don't control the content and so if that sets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem is an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I don't know what the answer is\nWe're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on checked and then when we come right through thanks to my social gifts to measure how this affects my baby technology called ... very climate and you can read all of our stories or BBC adult comb fresh technologies over their losses stories plenty plenty of information\nAnd you can read older that story's a BBC adult comb flash technology video losses stories plenty plenty of information that I'd like to join us again in the tech tense\n[noise]\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
