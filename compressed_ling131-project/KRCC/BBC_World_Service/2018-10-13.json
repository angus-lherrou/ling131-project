slightly different things obviously so um if you go to the Southeast Asia Thailand of it and um you'll see a lot of people young young case traveling on their own because they know it's so easy\nTo meet people is that going they're going to stay in hostels like in the you know there'll be lots of people in the same position that you have a nice chat with them so you know jumping up and I'm Still I'm having a sociable signed\nAn ulcer food the other in the spectrum is people going on cruises are so many people do that on their own thoughts\nYou have a choice then you don't have to be on your rent because there'll be plenty of people in the same position and see he can have a chat with and I know a lot of people do that but this is the opportunity to socialize so that's the other side of

connection all this stuff you do too I think when you're on your own more\nJonah thing which you go at holiday on your head while I\nI was intrigued by by what Leslie said than that she did the west coast three times and\nThe last time with her husband and I think when you do go on a visit places on your own\nIt it's very often that you you want to share those moments when you go and see I don't know the pyramids of Egypt or whatever it might be that said that when you're on on your own it's not quite the same as sharing that experience with with other people having said that there's nothing like more than going out in the evening on my end with the book having a pizza or an an a beer\nBut then I find my own company ... very rewarding\nYou talk about sharing your experience does though

was a leading member of the after the on she know believes the party is a threat to Jim and democracy in must be ... she's written a book\nCalled inside AFDC about why she changed her mind about a former policy earlier this week she told me about what first attracted her to the AFC\nThat was quite a good feeling it was quite an interesting group of persons that was an open conversation so I had a ... a good feeling at the beginning\nThe party that will up in the ...
