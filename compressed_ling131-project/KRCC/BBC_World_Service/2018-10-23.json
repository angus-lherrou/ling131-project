I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that if I buy one ticket miles on winning up ...\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one in three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes\nBut win the jackpot ... gets large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves those billionaire\nSo even if my one in three hundred million show comes off that possibly others who will be sharing it with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nThat's correct I Believe the [noise] the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there's a pretty good chance that someone's going to win\nSo deals on me winning a pretty ... to us but the odds on someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the how the numbers law\nWould it technically be possible to buy some many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you couldn't buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible\nThere are three hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle [laughter] and then\nUh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of courses you're not guaranteed that you'll be the only winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winners\nAnd I spent on top of that to share logistics of buying that many tickets I'm going to be easy\nTo absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that\nTickets are going to be easy\n... absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that even if you have somebody going out of\nAll possible numbers in a certain range about one ticket every ten seconds you might be one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the lottery is drawn but you need to fill up three hundred million so you're going to need to hire a thirty thousand people\nAnd the tape that old gonna want to share with my ...

I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration okay\nKenny I'd like to me through now either from page to final productive what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I could listen to a song and immediately I seats matches of pictures in my head like I just see like steel frames and then I just have to reduce the gather and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to\nYou know please don't when I'm brushing my team I got a point when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nThe thing I'm trying to the way from is\nThinking about the idea is never watch for me\nI don't think about the idea initially ... come to me in ways and not when I'm sleeping and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down 'cause I Know I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred\nThe articles I Love that idea [laughter]\nA hundred percent I I don't know I didn't believe I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I was very choosy about it and you know and then of course I think\nI I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I Do have to say that that's what it is I shouldn't have been talking about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point the liberal chalk that has come in in in my career boots off presidents of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do that this is what we need to do I because I'm ... I'm a business parts in\nSecond to last stomach quintuplets in but we're not pitching arm cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach it I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look the dress you're going to win the props and usually the entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes\n[laughter] you know for me maybe I can get 'em\n... talks about repeat to listening all the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth and she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that decision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening crisis until you just can't you only is it ... you know you I mean it's like yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can probably sometimes you get a truck and I like can you give us a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little tricky because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging hang ours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a B and C and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and my cuts the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but not support a band director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say\nDear and my heart for the best you know I didn't quiet now at that time but not support a band director that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success for sure\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out bad because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIt's the biggest skeleton you if you're fishing for me on the energy of the project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I didn't have the opportunity of working of course with some amazing artists but then I think I'm looking by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond say\nYou're listening to the conversation ... to ... do we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you burn operating at a level where many of the office he worked with a huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think cadmium specific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to sing sing holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for somebody when something a little bit differently so just Indonesia yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way because I mean I have to put myself especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to medical male dominated field and then at the added cross all starting off\nOn television so I was a funny person that now want it to be a girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park\nThe first ever project that I did well official project and I did music video and was a music video for an award ceremony that I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm a director now and it's like yeah I mean that's what we want you to stab when you come out of the stage and things like that\nAnd I mean I'm not just one one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the on the show and he called me like I was like absolutely love this treatment and bite off you know that I call it that is one\nAnd I needed to make a decision about pointed out that you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me gave me\nThat's one and I needed to make it up on it and I said you know what how 'bout you do this how about you don't pay me\nGave me don't you what I Need to execute this project and you can get a better deal because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I thought that talking eventually\nTo position myself I wasn't heaven forbid that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten long boosted tuition but that is the only project on how to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to use a lot of people call me that we would want a girl so [laughter] because they just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter]\nI'm very expensive very kind of holding ... he didn't have to give me because I figured I'd give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging dollar um ... ...\nThey're probably like I'll give you their projects that I Do for nothing at all but that would lead me the money when they came to me my budget or with a little bit too much for them I really love the the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone\nI needed to work in this project alright strong somewhere\nIt's an effort is going to be given to me I think I can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased because they're the rule of thumb that older active get temp set of budget\nVision what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of the budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be Eva let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand\nAnd that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work ... you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter]\nBecause of the matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and actually just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nLee contested congressional race and the issue is leaving many voters on the fence and he just had\nA I don't know I'm a I'm a little bit on the\nI

n._r._a. for this ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who were drawn from that
