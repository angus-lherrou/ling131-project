I Would call them digital Brett comes but also some physical evidence that would then\nAh basically to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the ah these are ... in April and the only had about a a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of\nAh coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm\nJust on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives in the sense that we don't know if I say smoking or through the been infiltrated we'd seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what an certainly is a story of it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself if you know I mean\nIs there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't it\nIs there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and then and the way in a good place like you know that they manage to get back together all these governments and to have all these like press conferences across the globe I guess obviously like that does put them in a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are\nA you know get a call to you know I you know seven times a then it's kind of\nA you know like with what we saw yesterday was like you know how to them in a way I kind of like puts things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so eagerly to prove that they're so great at these kind of like starts and people's minds actually you're not that great\n... I mean you you use the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the ... and when you look for ... for example she doesn't look very embarrassed\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether whether you're behind\nThe scenes there may be people looking at ...\nI'm sure they didn't receive than use our happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you try to show off your uh your skills and then you get called in and it's a ... a temp that's not really a great day for you [noise]\nAh but that's also like you know like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever they're called I never there's an accusation it's oldest denial it's always like you know uh the mark or the or the investigations they always say there's no blues over your see although we did see you know the ... pictures and all of these things\nSo that's that's not really surprising what I'm saying\n... I'm not just as I said I Do find it um finish it said it it it is creeping into our everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to to push by not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives and a lot of pushback against the sense\nThink that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life as practice something we call digital and hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know a a changing your passwords often backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for of how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your a door open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like practice these minimum\nThe same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your door open and I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back this nice minimal things that would I\nMean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um adage that hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the ... crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir like the sophisticated enough enough investigation\nAn omelet geopolitical level do you see any sign of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level\nSo late to this this month Russia is planning on submitting to drop through the motions\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for house they should behave with a together you know each other into cyberspace also won a G adjusting and you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been a demented by the concept of Europe\nSo obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday\nAnd I think um so the Russian activity and like you know a they wanted to step in and see but also they want to come to the negotiating table from its position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information I mean that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals so you've got that on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against this ad is just so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you know that are not you know or Russia or China or like with what the states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided the kind of like you know to as their side so you could easily argue that\nPoint thank you very much for coming to us our way of trust them house you're listening to the b._b._c.

concluded that the death has been announced to the Spanish will pressing among throughout ... she was eighty five to ... that was long the mud as one of the finest Sopranos in the world\n[noise] now it's been a year since allegations of sexual abuse against many women over many years by the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein first hit the headlines the outrage these provoked inspired a huge wave of support for the me too movement across the world\nGoing to hear now about the impact in China are women speaking out against abuse an Harris meant\nIn twenty Fifteen a group of campaigners who became known as a feminist five were sent to jail for several weeks off to handing out feminist leaflets\nThe American journalist and writer later Hong Fincher has been following this story and the story of the other women in China who are fighting for quality her new book is called betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China and she's joining us you know do you do in Bristol in West in England at least welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me\n... described the feminist five fifth vote to lose a bit more about the\nWell and twenty fifth Cain there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China and wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment sticker is at subways and bus station but before they were even able to carry out\nAnti sexual harassment stickers\nAt subways and bus stations\nBut before they were even able to to carry out that activity the Chinese police carried out a really sweeping round of arrests in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually ... dead and enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... so the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as if we can preview unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nA much more broadly defined really are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described how much will do representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women and China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally the ... would do as well I'm Emma may be a question to\nPost high visit and I wanted to use it as green today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to kind of on the ground [noise] yeah\nWell I mean it's so interesting because originally made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there is very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedom so unlike in the u._s.\nIn China because there's so many obstacles there's very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse and China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles\nAnd and today you still see young women emerging up all across China um across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse for me to pose to being censored on well they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the meat to hashtags so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when me to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activist came up with the idea of using him oh jeez I'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie image eat meat\nTool I should get around and at at work for a while but then the then it'll get right Patricia I'm I just wondered\nWhether this movement has been given timidity by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this changed so much would this would have one child policy on that because there were probably fewer women but in more than ... than the than there might have been a generation of but whether this uh played into its it's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers why do you think\nMen and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers [noise]\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently so troubled by these semi when you look at communist ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what rate of women campaigning for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen prevent such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of ... now the domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd for several decades sit in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but\nBut there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grave and said these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home ... not just for me to say thank you very much to

Latino sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global Saudi and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning a well\nThe short answer is yes we did find learning us in every country and in every age group all over the world\nIn terms of age we can also say that the age trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steeper so there was a bigger reduction in in loneliness a cross the lifespan than in others but at the trend is always they\nAre but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of loneliness for almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to ultimate taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand as far as mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being highlighted statistics museum and talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loading us all the time most of the time and it was around ... percent and then you see ... population advice from New Zealand quality of life sit by\nAnd the computers to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six percent of people so it's interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again\nI'm why do you think that that might be slightly lower levels of loneliness and use it and because they don't say there isn't any it's just that the levels are but\nI have a few theories one might be around the composition of the coaches and New Zealand for about a food of people come from ... I'm coaches in particular Modi coaches that the indigenous population in New Zealand and I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the clicked was coasts\nParticular Marty coaches that the indigenous population and use the land and I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the click of his coach is on the majority New Zealand European coach I Am and teams of connection and the importance of of working together and supporting each other\nAnd other is is maybe around uh the proportion of one person households UCLA has a slightly lower right to that than the u._k. may be a tool so to be with activities that John groups such as sports participation which these you know what I'm doing well and then maybe it's the climate most of the population will be in the up and move on and which\nMeans that they aren't really hip extremes and temperatures so these are going to be warmer summers and mild winters and most people close to the coast so they could be some sort of relationship around\nUh being out in about an engaging with the beach and spending time outdoors which is more difficult in countries when they were going to be quite harsh winters\nOr way they are really hot summers animal periods where it's difficult to be outside because extremes in the ...\nOn the march explained the connections that people can create more easily\nCaught instinct did a study looking ...\nComparing the north and south Ogden museum because it costs ... oranges and lemon and and you know that the climate spokeswoman than it is in the south islands that'd be interesting to see if there was a difference when it came to letting us\nYeah yeah and also in terms of rural communities and but then I think the rule communities and in Britain and elsewhere in the ... will save the ... the grace of connections and closeness with night as\nIn the research firm wave looked at people living in\nGenerally independent couches wet people are more reliant on themselves and proud of being without until themselves compared with the interdependent cultures within a more collective is that people rely more on family and friends one of the things we found is that um people in the independent cultures value that\nRomantic relationship small they make more of a difference to whether they fail less ... than they do in ants dependent cultures where people may have family and why to families to rely on as well or not is just one person that we might too I was wondering what you would say in in New Zealand that what what would you how I say Maui ...\nMulti coaches collective is in terms of how it will be structured in terms of a we have which is in charge of the biggest social group right down to find out which is the extended family units and people will have the connections obviously with the what a family but also with the with the ...

with Mexico Mr Trump wasn't cool it messed up it's a new arrangements he says the U.S Mexico Canada agreement us MCA\nHaving campaigned in the twenty sixteen presidential election to end the bad trade deals President Trump said this was the most important one the United states has ever made so we hit that good and does it vindicate his aggressive approach to trade here's on economics correspondent Andrew woke up this certainly\nLooks like an important achievement in political terms before he took office President Trump was deeply critical of the original North American free trade agreement calling it the worst trade deal the U.S had ever had\nRenegotiating it or even withdrawing from it was high on his agenda when he moved into the White House and now he has something to show for the F ... just a few weeks ahead of the congressional mid term elections politically that can only be helpful for him and the Republican policy\nIt's also the case that the new agreement includes some specific provisions that Mr Trump really wanted the rules on cause what's needed for them to qualify for duty free treatment to the U.S border on an important example they will make it that way harder more expensive the comic is to include components materials from outside North America\nFought so stale from China obvious examples but no it's the only ones\nThe new rules that up to forty five

Canada has also improved access for American dairy producers to candidates highly regulated market\nBut there are doubts about just how impressive the games will be on dairy the improved access is small on cars even if some production does go back to the U.S some suggest it could be highly automated jobs for American robots\nBecause those are the likelihood that it will raise the price of college for the American motorists though it may not be obvious to prospective buyers and the show them that they are paying more or exactly why\nThere's a wide a question to underline President Trump's assertive approach to trade is a preoccupation with the deficit and us international trade the country ... from abroad than it sells to foreigners\nOn dairy the improved access is small on

approach to trade is a preoccupation with the deficit and us international trade the country by small from abroad than it sells to foreigners\nIt was a theme he returned to repeatedly when he sat out the new agreement with Canada and Mexico to the media the United states and its trade deals he said has lost on average almost eight hundred billion dollars a year\nThat's the death as he don't trading goods and he wants to get it down or preferably eliminated\nThe trouble is the most economists don't think that trade balances whether a country has set up as well deficit a determined by trade policy most will tell you it's about spending and saving a country which spends more than ... and we'll have a deficit\nThere is something else that President Trump is doing that he doesn't to pay to think age linked to trade policy tax cuts\nIn fact one way of country can spend more and save less government has a deficit in his own finances now the economic relationships are very complex but it's certainly possible that lower taxes and increased government borrowing could mean a bigger trade deficit\nIt would be very premature to come to any conclusions about whether Donald Trump has been good or bad for the U.S trade deficit and there is another debate to be had about whether the deficit mass is very much into what\nWe can say is it is bigger than when he took office that is what the data shows that could only aggravate his view of the U.S as a victim of bad trade deals in bad trading behavior so we can expect to see a lot more of this must get a approach to trade

people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you set up camp today's consent\nRight well there are a number of different solutions and and uh ideas kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently of the world bank event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at below chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions\nCentralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on but at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an odd how recently got ... uh again reactor number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all um\nSome ideas about using self overnight entities way you have your identity on your mobile phone only you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with the service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by you rather than being held in the central place that can be hacked\nBut at the moment there's a number of different solutions that are vying for the time um but to centralize ones which are the most common at the moment all the most vulnerable\nThat's Ken Banks now what have you done to minimize your carbon footprint and use less energy costs out ed travel perhaps so made your home more energy efficient but maybe you should also consider giving up Netflix Amazon Prime video and other on the mound

of Lancaster University has been researching the growing energy use self video streaming which now accounts for the majority of Internet traffic\nThe Internet the data centers the digital devices all account for about eight percent of global electricity demand and that's about three percent of carbon emissions which is roughly equivalent to the airline industry\nAnd because video streaming at such a large share more than fifty five percent of all Internet traffic um you could say that around three percent perhaps of global electricity demand goes towards video streaming and supporting that\nBut how does streaming video can pass energy use with good old fashioned broadcast TV [noise] Chris praised is professor of computing sustainability at Bristol University\nI think we can definitively say that broadcast TV is definitely more efficient than video on demand a but on the other hand video on demand is a more sophisticated service the Brokaw Stevie Brokaw Stevie effectively you're providing

particular code click clean it encourages them to use renewable power the campaign groups I T analyst Gary cook says consumers can make a difference\nWe've seen over and over that when consumers speak up until the companies that they want them to be going to be ... be remind really sensitive and for Internet companies be our energy they listen Facebook was the first company to make a commitment and two thousand eleven and they have consistently followed through\nApple also heard from their consumers and twenty twelve and serve customers speak up and say we want to do better or it is what are your competitors that carries a lot of power\nWe are to speak to buy as Netflix and the BBC's I play that team neither was available for an interview but each stressed that commitment to cook the environmental impact [noise]\nBut what about us should we stop streaming Mike has us from Lancaster University\nIf you're concerned about the environmental impacts of your your everyday life\nThan the main thing to think about with regards to streaming is whether that stream video is really being watched as a lotta times our research has found that video is used to provide a just background noise and and as it turns out\nA broadcast radio is an excellent way to provide that sort of that same sort of ambience and does not require at that extra energy that that streaming video does\nBut professor Chris priest in Bristol says we shouldn't be too hard on myself\nI Would say it's not our job to feel guilty if the job of those who provide the services to engineer the services in such a way as to be as energy efficient as possible\nAnd That's Chris priest of Bristol University a jarring Wakefield some extraordinary figures here uh about uh I mean which I'm gradually become aware of

when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get off that feels good to\nUh would look at the time frame ... could at least but says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will on it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a natural Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we were able to make shift without it I remember that is based if we're going to do a big\nBig job ... increase renewables about six thousand percent others huge huge drop ...\nOn on how are you just mentioned also\nStuff and we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to be reached the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is it'd be like to know soft and we'd be debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce states being built ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like\nIt'd be like to know where he smoked and we'd be debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built toughest new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil teams competition with the down as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough is anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince is kind\nOf we have to look on what are our options walked all the renewables for example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get the bio do so well uh you get that perhaps\nIf you're lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if you have to produce it by making some of our Lance part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineer stuck the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called a clean uno they changed their name it's part of that strategy because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or at the same time\nAnd who are going to develop that well it's the engineers stuck to now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called a clean uno they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more\nGreen gay or at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned sees like no the region's big ... on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're carry you wants to connect\nWith CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway where every political party actually agree on it and we'll let me just explain what we mean by that cash or sorry it's essentially\nThe idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know where she spent government suspend quiet all of a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think also an to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense I guess I don't think when you were saying that solution it's more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate change it's if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nFans think it's I don't think when you were saying that solution it's more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production\nIf you're export power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion about your work about where you live with what you're going to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seats in production and it's expected to increase for two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local uh energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the community and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for their energy I think actually we can make really good energy future it's here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should sign certain areas certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars is it is in ... in creating a market for any technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical thoughts and ships because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nBecause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nThat new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so there because of\nAn I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we talked about there's only two developments and then will reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in the interim ... I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come into falls no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the er and merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to the degree and shift to even do if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made out here I Know but it's it's it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do\nMan I'm a ... a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted that if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made out of here I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and it's happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of over ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well where the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that you knew about energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new region gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\n[laughter] does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city\nThere is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas and oil and gas\nOn board that terminal comes from the burn seat comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane and some people might not the reason to buying it but it will say that it means that the way the counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ... in the ...\n... on board ducked terminal comes from the burn seat comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy that\nShe can argue that new region energy as plain as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that the way the counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ...\nIn the air and sea have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily good that Norway goes to Brussels and ... for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe gas will exclude cold\nWe have to rely on what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices are starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out for a new\nCity still and to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to call them pricing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to your guests and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments that\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe pasta\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to your guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty states and Europe is committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way which treats citizens for the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of the stasis is no way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast to Europe or to visit only plays in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always as easy accessible proteins or so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food\nGoing on on thank God we didn't have an ability federal we we have a terrier since I've been\nLooking at a lot at the history and one important objective that sets and and I think some of the supposed to keep the moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit ... in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards we almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nWe we have a military and since I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective that sets in and I think senator it's supposed to keep them moderate pays for the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sets in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards we almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry and so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018",
