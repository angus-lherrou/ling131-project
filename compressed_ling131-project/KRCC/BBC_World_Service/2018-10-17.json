today all twenty eight ill leaders meet to discuss the issue at a summit in Brussels today it also meant to be a big moment when the deal was finally done\nThere is a big stumbling block though what to do with Britain's only land border with Europe that's between Northern Ireland which is part of Britain and the republic of Ireland Donald Tusk the president of the European Council says the goodwill as their butts he wants to British prime minister Theresa May to come up to the table when in fact\nA lot of senior people arriving at the summit amongst those speaking as they ended up as the French finance minister Bruno the ...\nUh he said we are not far from a deal so that's the top line coming from the news agencies but you can bet he means a deal that the EU wants a he's probably expecting you to fold a let's talk about the issue in white is such a big stumbling block captain bomb out is a senior research fellow\nOf the nonpartisan research group UK changing Europe she is professor of a new law so very well qualified at Cambridge University here's a guide to why the Irish border issue is such a sticking point\nThere is a binary choice and that is you have a hard border in Northern Ireland but that means that the u._k. is out to the customs union and can negotiate the free trade deals for all we have no room for it and it was announced that through the nose around in the south\nUm but that means we stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts but it's actually a shift in political position\nAnd that's the problem and the moment to reason they has she knew Rico room on any shift in position and that's a real problem they used to\nAnd if there is no deal done by the tend to not much we will leave with no deal which most come and take just believes will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me\nI mean it'd be champions the Golden State warriors happened pushed hard in the opening game of the new season\nThere how did the championship brings for last season before that one hundred nine to one hundred win over the Oklahoma City thunder of el ... and the the L Ross\nWith us now to the world of video games and you may have heard of one called Fortnite it's a big global hit with online gamers with tens of millions of players across the world for the initiated Fortnite is a collaborative shoot 'em ups survival game essentially\nIt's also a big money generator and now the creatures epic things are going one player Brandon Lucas who is posted videos on line on how to cheat while playing the game\nSo how big of a problem is it when the online video get within the online video game industry let speak to Ellie gets in video games journalist who joins us in the studio ... have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game went down again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to the people if you want you can buy a thing called a season politics about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in that sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season pilots and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted online there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon\nLucas so yes ... is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them and these are enable prior to cheat basically the he's made these include ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to wait a minute\nAnd outfits and that sort of thing and but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in that sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes it Brandon Lucas is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them and these are enable prior to cheat basically he's maybe ... ... does it it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been selling these modes to the game online and for upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yeah and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and\nThese other people cheating and of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's right that basically accusing these papers copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to all you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one though surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does this well this\nIs in fact new 'cause it's argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says ... of other people doing this you know why they picked on him um\nAnd you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fast food night raid ... yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think and I'm a ... this was a

and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidate to see what Canada is going to do because\nEric way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries that down as within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on full it will not be without bumps that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there is even enough marijuana that's one thing we've been married at the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the for who they\nAre right is it because it's such a stampede the basically the country's going to be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but the average people will have to take it and bring it home or ticket\nIn ... so good at private because it's

three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from ... in a fool's\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's go fix phases\nAnd we'll take more than ten years to complete complete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred ... megawatts of power\nNow that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR scene neater used that much power as\nWell as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for

battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an onboard generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely unreliable you right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large\nAnd for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a

batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the bus boating that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus in Europe you worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably in the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London

all of us in this industry are actually watching the ...

we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and ... by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi or

parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy city to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America who is going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jump over
