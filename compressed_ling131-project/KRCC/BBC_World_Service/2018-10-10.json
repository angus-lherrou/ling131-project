I think this is now ... with us today that period of just four years to walk through what has become sort of revolving door at the national treasure but at the end of the day I mean we've obviously congratulated due to the way through as I say she'd be kept out of political exile\nThe people as you say you can keep changing the problems continue to mount up and not be addressed what do you think needs to be the first thing on the to do list to the new man in office\nI mean despite all congratulating she turned away the on these points that we do have some reservations because if your trip is some of the postings on social media that he's posted all over the years ... frankly a little bit leading and often seem to be at odds with government policy\nSo for example earlier this year than humanistic posted that he thought that forty percent of the line should be owned by the state to South Africa so I think that the first order of business is for the minister to carry by his is on the call it\nDifficult decisions need to be invaded and wants to ministers terrified of your views on the economy he will have to make those difficult decisions add an ounce those difficult decisions in the medium term budget policies stay in two weeks targets politics and\nCentral to that will be a way the old school are how he a deal with\nThe fiscal consolidation in an environment where and all

created a new demilitarized a buffer zone but it's unclear today\nOr whether any of that has happened other jihadists than have about five days to leave the zone\nNow the uncertainty is pretty dreadful for the citizens who are ... there are many of them were evacuated from other rebel held areas in Syria you could describe them as ... because\nThe Turkish border to the north is closed that

three he'll watch in small video from across the last ... fell to think if you remember with showers war has seen happening since\nI went to rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developer so it's kind of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better start the if it makes sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is now it's just about making it better and I certainly will be a story that the ... yeah that's right so you ... are among\nThose sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figured out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce and ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people and it will qualities and some railway quilt again what happens tonight tonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that starts\nIn a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through season three and I'll be watching it with

an old tire evil tighten your belt and seeing how that is what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich state of being in a room sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nTo scientific discipline that he goes back to the results of your experiments that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer that question unless they get really stuck you know\nI don't want it in their fear because they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world W I came all bull to code is going on in the late to legacy patients of pandemic [noise]\nAre always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguages from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way\nLanguages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nFulltime languages from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all effect in some way I mean you'd like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nSo if not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on the cover you just won't do it in Germany so it it'd be a thing called trip to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo it's kind of postal German ... combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games friday it fit into\nWhat were called German games the nineties and then euro games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey added designed games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else instead you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I haven't taken anything from you I just prevented you from getting some things\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about four games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the post war aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred games develop their general cone selling gangs about everything you

is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many must send send the well so we we have a group of Muslims who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA values who are essential\nTo them at the same time so it's not

victory for freedom of expression\nFreedom of expression includes both the right to express and a point of view but also the right to not be forced to express or facilitated view with which you disagree\nSo the upshot of today's ruining his ashes cannot be legally forced to aid the promotion of same sex marriage but putting such a slogan on a cake\nBut it also means that gay bakers cannot be

in this case we've got this slightly odd situation in Britain when Northern Ireland does is the only parts of the United kingdom that doesn't allow gay marriage or you can send it could limit support
