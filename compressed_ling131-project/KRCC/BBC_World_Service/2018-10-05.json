green credentials carry it has with ... what I\nDo believe that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and shouldn't be taken into account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in Norway and\nWe have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Kent Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a major league towards a more green society\nEspecially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the field to credits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active\nPolicy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on how\nAnd ah it's actually part of making a Europe more green\nOkay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen batteries dinner region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe\nFrom ... it will be other countries who will take place in Europe I don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced\nHim carry this this is not the view that shed by much the Norwegian public that actually better that no way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it up clean the from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of us I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels than being dependent on importing ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy and seeing a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets mission can ...\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal in the works\nBut I don't know oh you know we're talking about oh yeah\nAre my point is that if you have replaced coal plants for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world to my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nFirst has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for ... in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with ... but we have to do it in a way that actually it's yeah doable\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense and ... see the kids actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long ... county and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue ... can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... and find out what's next incident and I'll ... back years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are ... much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nSaying that Norway it's the bad guy ... put it into words for the students and when I talk to them today and told him out what's going ... say well we are the richest country in the world why can't really afford to making a plan to get off that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame ... ... college but says well it could be doing until twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on ... hey it's natural Energy Agency does have that still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based ... to do a big\nBig job ... increasing renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge drop ... ... on on how are you just mentioned also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement that ... you know it's not ... and we've been debating ... those\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built how fast new investments are being made into renewable energy and\nIt's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil team competition with the down as a politician and in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself it's green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough to anybody else going to buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become easier but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options walked all the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you have to do so well uh you get to a perhaps\nIf you're lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called a clean uno they changed their name it's part of that strategy because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coast\nSo now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address DCSS view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... none of which have successfully been no ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burn sees like another new regions of the ... on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to can I can see the ads is definitely important and we are in that situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... just explain what we need cash or sorry and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology is it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to trying to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater Penn thing is I don't think when you were saying that solution if more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate change it's if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to let us know what you think the program or if you have any idea of the topics ... the real story at BBC don't Kendall UK and you can subscribe to the ... such the b._b._c. the real story ... stop [noise]\nOf the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio counted eight PM American public media with support from see three I O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial intelligence\nAnd we're working there with local or energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the community it's on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if you think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can\nMake really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is an example would be creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\n[noise] well I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen than it meant that the other industries for really growing so within\nStick to the oil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other in the streets were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway we have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it can come into falls\nNo no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degree and shift to even though we we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the amount of time sector or because they were on the picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell done you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made out of here I Know but it's the it's it sounds like it doesn't sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of over ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that you and your energy we indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum will that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't ...\nSporting petroleum well that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is generally grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulled away a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an older guys\nOn board that terminal comes from the bar and seek comes from her fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not three into buying it but it will say that it means that no way to count to eight to lead powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new route surrounding North Pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much to Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the air and sea and I don't think it's necessarily kit that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat ... that is according to the carbon browsing and if you see the current price hasn't been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe gas will exclude cold wave to correlate to what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push up renewables\nFail and would have to have to understand that the renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid he'll be able to carve uprising now but also the way the energy system works and seems to new energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing Alex\nThe way the energy system works and seen through new energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector after twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people are ... the the way which treats citizens of the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was off on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of it stays a new way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the ... the only places in Europe where it hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible ... so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on\nThank God we didn't have an ability we we have a military and since I've been\nLooking at a lot of history and one important object in the south and an incentive for keeping moderate pays for the construction and when they hit that limit that set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten year\nThat limit set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight but triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\nBut I guess I think what ... is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because insurers anyhow [laughter] I mean we have we have a well for a state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ...\nWhere

doing that is to intimidate countries on its borders\nTo show this kind of aggression therefore to weaken support for NATO and some of those countries I think what Russia would really like to do is when the war when the ideological ... without fighting but I don't think we can exclude the possibility that Sunday they will use weapons and the Russian Army famous for that it does what an exercise as\nBob Said he will not in that ideological contest that mocked the fifties sixties and seventies between the Soviet Union and the west what could be done what should the government's likely UK Government or the U.S to do in order to calm things down\nI think we're starting to close although this is Richard ... communism a sliver of society\nIt is a form of Russian nationalism or the great threat to mankind structured thirty is is how we in the west to fend for free societies from those very sophisticated all ... states\nTo developing means of state control which is not a conventional shoulder and people but also to aggressively absurd sauce with China for\nThat Russia or whether it's positive future who knows\nMaybe I was wrong maybe it is the idea of logical of those people who want to be presidents for life you know authoritarian regimes versus those who don't\nDepends what you mean by ideological but I mean I think certainly we are in a war of value their war is the wrong expression there is a struggle for values which values are going to dominate Europe over the next uh in the coming decades there are now parties who are part of the ruling coalition in Italy as there are for example in Austria\nWho also have very close links to Russia and who admire an advocate the Russian model of of politics corrupt crony capitalism authoritarian rule one man rule one party rule there is certainly a struggle of ideas\nAnd Bob CD can then the west can NATO can Britain a food this contest because it seems that robust armament might be the way to resist\nThem is one way I don't

power in this country that if you represent\nShould always ... or any authoritarian state you know you have to be up front bounce it so this line of sort of become more difficult [noise] we can give them a great power was fine\nTV stations it deliberately lie extra security ministry was but I Do think there's more that we should not be the most important thing to do that as we did in the end of the Cold War is a multi agency group for us to go to an expose explosion by the states that's\nObscene a member of the British Parliament and the conservatives the ruling party and an apple by the historian we can talk to ... in Moscow now I'll ask you about these allegations in reaction in a moment Sarah but since we're talking about the Cold War what does that phrase never end to the media in Russia\n[noise] it does yeah it's a sort of bonded around in the same way here as it is I guess in a in Western Europe and ... but I mean I guess I'd say that that's being twenty five years if I open society here and have my sometimes it seems that means getting back to the past let's say on a human level\nThings have changed so much hair that it's hard to think of as going backwards again I mean you know we took it off about the penetration of state media here and how that influences people's opinions and is that and he does but\nI look at what's happening recently with all the\nUh digging investigation that's being done by Jenn ... in Moscow, Russia gym it's primarily a digging up on the Internet information about people who was supposed to be secret agents you know things have changed people's minds that has changed\nTheir our attempts to invest the cloak and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different physical close to that back\nWhat then has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons agency the obesity W\nThe uh digging investigation that's being done by general let's say in Moscow Russian journalist primarily digging up on the Internet information about people who are supposed to be secret agents you know things have changed people's minds that has changed\nThere are tempted to reverse the the clocks and and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different difficult close to set back what\nThen has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons agents really OPEC W\nWell that is an old school reaction not ... dismissal and denial from Russia I mean the the uh the ... that's been coming from the west I think is slightly uh surprised most go up but it's replied in it and its usual way in a way that we've seen ever since\nI guess getting back to climate anticipation of climate and the ... and then I might Seventeen and they stay in school to know the rest of it is all about saying\nThat we didn't do its and accusing the west in this case the spy mania the foreign ministry put out a statement last night saying you know it looks like every Russian who has a mobile phone can now be accused of being a spy so they're not dissecting the evidence that staying there is no evidence but you know ... standing up our selves independently as many other people here are so\nIt's a slightly uncomfortable moments let's say for Moscow but at the moment is shocking to hold off as usual\nBut those investigative journalist so you mentioned and they've been very brave or do they have the opportunity to continue asking those questions about for example the colonel who they are doing to fight audio has been one of those who was in school for it\nBut we do and we're here and that's what we do so yes are there are opportunities and every time there's an opportunity to someone have to take it and it's Russian journalist and as the foreign press and I'm not so job I guess yeah so that people on line in particular this new generation of online investigate the investigative reporters who were going through databases who are finding information and then the people like us who head out to the\nNine time zones or whatever it was far east of Russia\nAnd trying to find people on the ground and when we do that we do find them we find the evidence say for example the allegation that or at least one of the men accused of the ... poisoning is a military intelligence agents while we took his photographs to villages\nAdvantage in the far east of Russia and we found people who knew him and I identified him as a military officer so uh it's impossible to hide it seems in a in the modern world enrolled in society and well stir journalists still allowed to work here then I guess it's a
