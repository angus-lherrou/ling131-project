instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer and possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork sign some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example\nQuibbling in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he signed some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous province you can use it essentially the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly\nWhat it looks like now that is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams there actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison\nNow of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health\nA society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there is a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women are concerned about the development of the fetus so again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush up on the possible boon to the economy that this development could have what are people thinking about that\nIn the months up to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an in twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spend rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they\nAbsolutely ... and across the world has just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drug on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries\nA lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states and we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking decriminalization so having this experiment in Quetta seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nThat was Jessica Buffy in Canada and that's it from the well this week from now

traveled to different parts of the world [noise] once you start realizing that once you take something from one place and put it in another place\nThat you're actually shifting materials you actually change in the constellation of that space so we can think of the Emirates we can think of to fire we can think of\nThe skyscrapers I mean can you imagine that a lot of Saddam has been taken out of the grounds\nTo be able to make ... we can then imagine how much time do we have used to be able to make that the relationship is not only about the west it's about different parts of the world and how we're working how we're shifting things from one place to another\nHow we're making wholes in other places and creating structures in other places and that also affects the erosion of that place it

Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I asked him what kind of people use it\nTheir primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet or on there for a massive information gap of finding a information knowledge and how to improve the farmer or ...\nConnection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or ... or even off line so using an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS does does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a mess is obviously a hundred and sixty character as it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get good content people in such a simple format\nAs so when the former asks us a question uh for example on on SMS we'd unease machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they or do they farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAnd getting up his content back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think he just signed up and then in the millions member ... what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\n[noise] yeah so it would pass a million which is as I was a great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think that the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with his for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context as is probably in your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know procession within a million questions and answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their business apes and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicated they would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information to help them save or their livelihoods and farms through reform\nWas an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example\nI gave is a there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm in in Kenya called ... Kassoff he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a disease was ... it has killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farm\nPaid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farm and go get information back a witch boxing for years I just thought the disease spreading a managed to save the rest of the chickens\nUm which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihood and that's that's the kind of vital\nYou know often seems to us really basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El sol from ... in ... a special gifts to\nA that was one of those red now public a positive stories about social media or five years or so ago and one of those social media was going to say the will of the positive uses we're all that changed totally\nYes uh to live in was the year we celebrate and social media we thought it's getting to the world ... ... people and other retiree genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt towards the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regime weren't involved in the spot for him it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that yeah they ... they exactly\nWill use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now we're talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but of course the propaganda gets the highlight of the time\nA commercially it's still very important um uh an eighties eighties connecting people in positive ways as well uh ... do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\n[noise] uh we're still getting good but we're getting bad now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have to be that we're getting all mean good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it ... and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief would use every climbing or used do positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nAll we got time for anything on the positive thanks to my special guest Mona El Salvador from New York for the Institute\nGates that comes out of it it's not I for one another\nThat's all we got time for anything on a positive note thanks to my special guest Mona El ... from the opposite ends of the Institute thanks very climbing read over the stories in mind that BBC do come flashed technology\nAnd they forget to join us again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

University of Kent\nNine or ... novelist and journalist yes among lecture on government at Harvard University in Cambridge being bother Gopal I lecture at an English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a a ... that has been given and is used to describe claims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given\nCitizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with him because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with identity of a sudden than with questions of justice we can talk about that is a little bit\nMore Adrian past what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized identity individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that saw rocky arguing for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than more communal collective response\nYes among you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems\nFrom mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your last ... outrageous\nOh is that rather an important point Adrian how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nOr the the problem is that you have on the widespread checking across it can lead spinning abstract things are done resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have most of my knowledge the whole mythology responses to dodge and I think\nAbstract things that didn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of it is very healthy it's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever that real victims days we'll oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... alliance that\nThat doesn't or to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you hit contained that you'll suffering your passion was an offense against humanity many people would just simply not recognized as a threat to exactly in fact what the tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize that what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reasons why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation\nBut the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify what looked like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American standup comedian who falls enough with a wide them how can go into sort of dramatic love story they have no spotless [noise]\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bad movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protect them as has to find a wide wife couldn't she has found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right thing\nWho cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic ... leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between culture rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation that I needed a picture in a movie of interracial relationship\nIs probably not very identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nAnd devoid cultural appropriation those on your picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't all it takes into account of button all Hollywood wrong call nine eleventh\nFor you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well I think\nThe I mean what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful illness on a on an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us shouldn't be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there's somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nMe might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\nIt's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we\nPeople socially fearful Adrian\nIt's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the chronology of course they're real differences out and that to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out Jesus I read we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring them into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and humanity of calls contested there's no sense of of a consensus in this shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think we're done sports has become\nSo do I ... I I really would like Exxon tell us I mean I I'm hearing all these kind of very generic handwringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that would get on with black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples of what I wanted to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement in Monmouth has actually contributed significantly to understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that where disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal [noise]\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true\nBut the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the vacation is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and visit it particularly deep injustice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two\nWhite people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough [noise] people have never lived in monoculture moderate religious monolingual states this is new to a new\nSituation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOf the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other groups in society simply no longer function political parties\nTo to ... and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some feet and along the function physical policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing up on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and institutions and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with this uncertainties it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWhen it started to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic mono culture self conception of themselves and find God we've started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that that is something has talked quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by age as minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and that means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver an Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think that the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't handle UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost app [noise]\nDistribution service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio countered PPO American public meetings with support from the financial services for him of Raymond dreams offering\nIf pressed their ... because they're working ... not because they're white there is no evidence to tell us that the white looking classes are doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working class which\nIs an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German state elections in Bavaria what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see a few which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes were still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller the apology than it had been hemorrhage by the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant asked the on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is the leftist sent about ... ...\nIt seems to lose his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant or you know I'm lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and his biggest base people pushing themselves into those\nWithout seeing now because the mainstream parties offering something that's intrusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree period of close to working ... simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working class have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who are we to tell them that somehow that I didn't see much less than half of all they've got us all the other thing I'm not saying you did what I'm saying the idea that somehow\nWe can just say we're able to be most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not otherwise approaches and build some rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institution knots and feelings do methane St or the longing and the and they were going to place to people to communities and countries might just be kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity\nOf politics I only got to the obvious question that followed from that has been loaning so who onto wet\nAnd these parts of the reasons for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that actually ... the identity that with that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nIn northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say ... voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it wins bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and where we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amounts\nIdentify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all politics\nHappens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad I don't take it out I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domesticated ... feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make that inclusive to say that either hire\nA collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at it states but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under that common identity but how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots I'm\n... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know doc\nA side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of the country or wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nAnd you can only go back to our own Hannah rounds of adult anxiety saying that you love about it how do you enjoy it isn't the arrogance of toy what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused other people of identity politics but I'm saying your national\nTo dream of your poster nationalism I imagine you are and you know your as your your national thing making my country but I Know my ex enough majority in some of the majority of\nThem so I look at nationalism that something that had served it up as a ...\nInteraction of majority in some of the majority of them so I look at nationalism that something that had served it up as the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response would be the ... end up for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians the respect of\nMoney that he is not true and it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress talk he didn't have an ... elements to it the one hand that we do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what\nAge it if if I can bring it back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets\nWell because I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan isn't that you also spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the PIN number isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively and peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with\nThe actual ... cents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly do and\nThe people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fired for the cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and I didn't and emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\n... against this group goes against the ideal of the whole a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent and let's demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nThat's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national at something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that his English nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "20"}
