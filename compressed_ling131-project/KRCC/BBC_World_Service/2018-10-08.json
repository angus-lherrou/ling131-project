are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\n[noise] one of them that we have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe hurricane Florence which route so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his motives were suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue and mia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that prediction was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall rabbit rage with scale for when some of the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change stigma and the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increase due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from Freddie also which is that\nTake some clinics but couldn't read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most precipitation overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nVery interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability ever currents right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you can pin down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis\nA large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius as well as changes that have had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that something in our analysis that we account for though we're not just doing a uniform a change in the ... we actually have a pattern change of the SST that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that it actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light but Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\n[noise] it's marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially

there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slam\nThought those people who read forensic novels are probably more forensic

if they're respecting their readers to saying this is reality I Know it's just made the salt this is actually how it would be I don't\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary stories and you described so many countless experiences you've had with death but what you do you do and I don't know whether you feel like doing it now is is a share your feelings about what happens after death\nIf if when you looked at all of these dead borders it makes you more or less convinced that there is nothing else or whether you believe having seen so much that there is an afterlife\nI have no idea but when I get there I suspect I won't come back to Talia\nAs as far as I'm aware and nobody has ever genuinely come back\nNow I Know that we have people who die in the operating theater and are brought by by by medical life but there comes a point beyond which you don't come back we don't have his own base I spent my entire life with a dead and I've never seen it goes in my life\nDeliberately been spruce living spoke to me the living\nPut them stay there\nGet help and shy on being so cold Lee rational about it I mean\nConversation just before we came in here with ... and

end of the day\nBut why should we weren't you\nKnow well let's go get into why should we worry about whether I just don't know whether it's possible for you to apply the same rationality and ... for example to your own loved ones because we've all in this room experience probably most of us if not all of his experience back within our own families\nAnd I just wonder whether you when you experienced a death in your own family and I know you've lost both your parents whether your feelings upon\n...\nHas been different from the feelings you took when you were to ... to ... to those major police investigations you what my mother\nBut whether I just don't know whether it's possible for you to apply the same brush ... for example to your own loved ones because we believe in this room experience probably most of us a little of his experience in fact within our own families\nAnd I just wonder whether you when you experience and based on your own family and I know you've lost both your parents whether your feelings upon viewing\nVetted boulders\nHas been different from the feelings you took ... to ... to ... to those major police investigations you're well\nMy mother died a healthy to death within six weeks and my father took a long time to die because of all climbers on what was hard once they're dying\nThe deaths Wilson's hard on them being that wasn't hard it was watching quote they went through in the dying process\nSo whether that was painful whether that's protracted whether it was there was somewhere that they'd they'd never wanted to be um but when that came for both of them it was an absolute an altered release for them and every body and being that\nThey were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very shrunken but they were going on there was something\nIt was a metaphorical thing as well ... I mean again it's digging deeper into sort of difficult things but\nWhen you saw your shrunken dead father did you feel that his soul\nThat my father owned by that point my father had been all leaving a soul that so I guess you know\nBecause if something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done from it at all and that it was a much privileged place that I could ever has been\nAnd it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he felt drinking he stopped eating he turned to face to the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last breath and and the rifle that you hear when they talk about the death rental it's pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out with a last breath\nThan I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last brass\nSomething changed but my father a cease to be on the body that was left was not my father it was just a vessel that he occupied for his entire life my father had gone he had died is there something beyond I don't know\nAnd when he took that that last brass and and the rifle that you hear when they talk about the death rental it's pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out was the last breath\nThen I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's faulty but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last brass\nSomething changed but my father cease to be on the body that was left was not my father it was just a vessel that he'll ... for his entire life my father had gone he had died is there something beyond I don't know until they get\nTheir butts juicy chain fear your own to know if that's all I think it is the last great adventure you're going to do it once in a lifetime\nIf you're going in a long journey you'll always prepare for that journey why why do we know prepare for telling and I think I Want to experience every single moment to offer I Want to know\nWhat's it like to like if I can remember being born so I'd really like to know in those last stage of this is what it feels like this was for the signs like this is what it tastes like\nAnd then presumably I'll Remember none of it because all the time\nAnd what do you do ... to ... ...\n... I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't so um I I have an organ donor cards that they can use my organs to keep other people alive for as long as they they're used to anybody I suspect by the time I'm sixty five or so far down that nobody's gonna want them anyway\nSo I still in my ... farm to minor me department and I will hands my body to them when I die so that students can effect\nAnd then I I Want them to be able to gather together my bones you have to boil them time to get rid of all the fires and all the bits of muscle attached to it and then I Want them to re string me into an articulate the scallops and so that I can carry on living and teaching for the rest of my death\nOr go to a lot of engineers like holding them all firearm wherever they're going to just say sue block it's been an enormous pleasure to have you on hold to thank you very much\nMy perception that you thought he probably is going to\nGo last a hung jury on line with your line is basically the tax cuts necessary to

nice coffee inflation or other kinds of for Easter that of course our presence\nBut the not the risk of that the answer should stay out of the market\nThat I Know they said you said that most have actually problems would be sold if actually had its own currency but the fact remains it doesn't it just passed the euro being passed the euro involves various pledges and promises when it comes to spending when it comes to debt and that the European Central bank has said it will actually\nThe backstop they ... said he will do whatever it takes to save the euro but there is this concern that its ally if everyone's into problems would be just too big to safe does that not worrying\nAbout whether we have to understand a lot of the show because a\n... as you probably know we are unethical to sort of the European Union so basically we are paying the European Union if he doesn't receive a single penny by European Union about the cost of these we have to understand what is good for the kind of an economy and the at the moment the February ... the last thing line of the growing economy\nIn Europe but I Would say in the ... the ... came to I don't think that the thirty is lost the salsa but they showed up and down software industry play though or something I'd these okay but if you put it stop us so basically\nWe export much more much more be knows more than what we both\nHave a primary budget stop blessed so basically we collected dachshunds much more than what we spend and these numbers and not perception or something at the end of course we have a wonderful county so it's a it but he has got a lot of potential but to do stand with the policies that we put in place in the past the show\nI don't think that the thirty is lost the infamous off a but they show and they don't solve the industry play or something that these okay I have a positive but it's so basically\nWe export that much more much more ... more than what we both\nHave a primary budget stop blessed so basically we collected dachshunds much more of that what we spend and these numbers and not perception or something at the end of course we had a wonderful county so it's a a buddy has got a lot of

not to be a big prize in economy to understand that that we need to counter secret code policies [noise]\nSo uh that's that's the only way it used to have or the European Union is that new seats that we should do policies that they should the damage our girls but rather that that we are\nPaying the ... and ... allows us to do something that it's obvious that these\nContrary to what any kind of sensible policy themself knock it off should do well ... we should discuss it will be more and I think that we are going to do these after the election of may well all these a five year old a suitable

result of the confrontation with the European Union\nWould you expect the European Central bank to step in and help somehow what what what what is it what you expect what what is it what you want to see from the European Union\nThey they should do because ah it's a it's probably impossible to think that the if ever they allow such a stupid thing that a company like he thought he goes a out of the market the themselves everything he's that the end of that on no consequences were stuck on through like you've done it well [noise]\nI I think\nIt's a threat isn't it that you're putting down to the

may well be over the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that Italy's government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending

year\nMr Mr solving you dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels or we saw for example when that bridge collapsed in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed your for that year was fated to invest in Italian infrastructure\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who've come to the the the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seem to take on Europe\nAnd that means a major bust up with this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing hair that in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know who could they really take this to the brain can and were correct a real down to where it really affects the markets that really affects ... debt all over the years than\nWhat I think I think the the the best case the optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will disappear into the government can

regime\nAnd handed them over to more Franco friendly households today and the first ruining if it's kind a coat in Madrid found an eighty five year old going to college is called Eduardo ... guilty of his part and the practice\nAnd Nineteen sixty nine he had taken a baby from her biological mother had given her to a woman who was falsely registered as the birth mother\nThe baby now a woman in her

do with journalists I have never been reported to the police I have never been to prison I Am totally afraid of his very soon\nWe shouldn't feel the same thing up to ... play had enough of my questions and headed for the door\nAnd that was the BBC's gotcha I bless speaking to Dr Edward ... back in twenty eleven well Lucy Williamson has been covering the trial for us in Madrid and joins us live now from there tell us more about the costs decision that Lucy\nWas it was a strange kind of addicted a um at one is that it was found to have taken in as much as they got from her mother straight off to have a Nineteen sixty nine he was found to have foolish cuts us a ticket and was found to have given her to another couple or the gift\nBut the court also decided that too much time had pasta actually convicting the statute of limitations in this case only extend it to ten years after the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now it's up to that or walked free\nWe spoke to in is off to the day she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the trees had been officially established\nHim I think they'll be in the ... when the one that I feel good because the Spanish\nThe court also decided that too much time had pause to actually convict him to the statute of limitations in this case only extended to ten years off to the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now so to that or walked free\nWe spoke to in his off to the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the truth had been officially established\nSame I think there'll be a and seemed to be able to get when the one that I feel good because the Spanish ... yes maybe have been stone in Spain and also that mother wasn't lying she always told the truth\nI don't mind that he's not going to jail it's not the most important thing but did he can't leave the house people will recognize him and everyone knows who he\nSaid he condemned anyway now the second phase stopped getting to the Supreme Court and let's see what they decide on the statute of limitations\nReaction there in his mouth or go Lucy one woman one snatched baby them one doctor in this case but this has always thought too much much wider war is a reaction bringing women around the country or have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one doctor and one woman who he helps\nDeliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting innocence history this is about opening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's paused at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps\nTens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years like in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on ... to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years was because they were on marriage or simply judge to pool\nThey throw it in the Nineteen seventies and eighties complain and say since he became a master of trafficking the children for money\nBut this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside court today waiting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that don't develop had walked free free without any punishment one described as a slap in the face\nBut there were others that were happy the state headed knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as\nOr seen the judge to pool later on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties complain and say it seems they became a master of trafficking the children for money\nBut this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside cool today waiting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that do it because I had walked free free without any punishment one described as a slap in the face\nBut there were others that were happy the state headed knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as whose baby was taken away by a nun in Nineteen Seventy four before pilot could even gave her first child and name she told me or even learned its gender\nImmediately off the bus she said she was injected with a drug that left to unconscious the following day ... the baby had died\nWhen pound demanded to know what happened the doctor said it was an act of gold when she also the the puppy she was told it had already been beret forty four years later talking to us she still cries episodes of the child she never got a chance to hold\nThe line you know but when I got it down if you're going to get thrown around\nAnd tell us on the day if you will have to say I write tend not to say you and nine months and my ... on the left changed the five minutes to get into them by there have you ever seen which the child and the other one is such an intimate tendons heal humankind\nLots Paulos story or Lucy or just one story one case will it be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what Spain Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials abroad in the future that have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case I mean it up to a veteran himself is believed to has destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried on\nAnd of course many of those involved now very elderly um innocence adopted mother in fact confessed to the situation to her before she died\nBut because because she was handed and it says a baby a mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was don't develop is the man who can tell how but despite this landmark trial\nIn is it still closer to finding out who the mother is or even if she said alone\nSo that case I mean it up to the vet himself it's believed to has destroyed evidence relating to the case he was tried and of course many of those involved and now very elderly and innocent adults in not in fact confessed to the situation to her\nBefore she died but because she was handed and it's it's a pain the mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\nUp to that is the man he can tell how but despite this landmark trial in is it still places to finding out who had the mother is or even if she said alive\nLucy thanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams and that in Madrid and if you go to the BBC website BBC don't come forward slash news\nAnd you look on the the stolen babies story you can see the video of a\nCatch the object confronting Dr Eduardo valid that from her assignment program from a few years ago they stay with us here on the program we'll be looking at the new climate change report in the second half and but also be hearing a conversation that the are missing Saudi\nSo we'll aside PCC report have any impact in the United States I've been speaking to Gina McCarthy for administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency who was the lead on President Obama's climate change policies\nIn the United states at least people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public understands that\nThe real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as far away problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines are maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California and the west\nBut frankly you know climate change changes everything it really is the biggest threat that we have to public health today to our safety you know to uh wellbeing to our economy's to jobs this is about national security as well and people need to understand it and personalize it\nAnd if you look at American it's not monolithic picture is that as you say the the White House the current administration suddenly takes a different views the administration usa but if you look in the Twenty one states say they still signed up to the Paris or agreements many cities many local ministry rations\nBought without central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they are trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send you know this isn't a short term problem this is this is a\nOut central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send you know this isn't a short term problem this is a this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today which\nIs why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector but it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about his marriage jobs and it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs or on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely had you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster\nThan we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line but this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult to get America change their habits\nHad to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued them we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumers money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save\nReasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued them we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pump\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for\nAll of us we took her outside of the large look at some of the the extreme weather America seems to be having to to do with more and more I mean is that having an impact do things on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter\nAnd instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities\nLet's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we've never had them before or the drought we're facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift every buddy up\nAnd moved to a future that's better for everyone I feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running\nTowards and this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states even going to just be seen as another more of the same that washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid am I\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nI was Gina McCarthy former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency\nSay that I just now in the disappearance of the prominent Saudi journalist ... ... the U.S based dissident who writes for the Washington Post hasn't been too\nA conversation that that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid am I to what the opportunities of
