that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issues that it to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nI think it's interesting 'cause there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished I think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for\nThe note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much of the agenda I'm really solidly behind\nThere's very few Republicans who are just interesting themselves who are facing election right now or reelection\nFrom Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in lied to his administration\nAnd his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if from one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effectively leading\nThe party and leading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I also can add something about ... we've had shootings in the United states\nWe had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nThere's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in ... surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before the election it sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncover your what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says a bug women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican pie\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion and what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to it\nIs that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged and be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of that critical group of voters\nAnd the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that leaves these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in to living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the the group of voters that does zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I it's really losing the influence how do you see badly\nI you know [laughter]\nI think there were a couple of primaries that sort of ... some headlines I'm not sure that we have anything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of globalization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats have necessarily pick sides that are so which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're a unified opposition to president jumped at this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that made proved valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short on top of each of you or how much can use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate Lee [noise]\nWell I think you do that and I suspect cats will agree with it I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I ... how is likely to go democratic and and the centers like this stay Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clear\nIt's like to go democratic in the sand is like is the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be criminally insane river Democrat but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in front it just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats for on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse doesn't hold its just all these Democrats or the Trump carried\nLabor and golf director of the Marist College poll and cafe Frank of it and then and then holding an election consultant you'll have your own views you might
