this\nI'm curious to know if you can tell us a bit more about um how the migration debate has a really you know colored the discussion around these political parties in their um lack of support or or um more support sort of garnered as a result\nOf the migration debate is absolutely essential to this and take out an Fifteen that you know I'm going to knock her a lot of the last ... ed refugees into the country\nI Want to know people were delighted I remember being at the at the train station when they were coming in and people were applauding them as it came off the trains but a lot of people really weren't very happy about it\nAnd so at it because of the politics at of the the main parties people have been moving over to seek other alternatives and you have people who are very unhappy about the immigration is she going to the far right parties ... very eye on the immigration and on on the market one medical I'd\nAnd and [noise] and you are the there's the other alternatives in Bavaria there's also another a spender party from the sea SUV that's higher than that\nThey're not quite as as as radical honesty and our state and a lot of people are going there but you also have people who in the middle who feel disenfranchised by the ... so they are also a they're going further left they've gone and massively to the greens and the greens actually signed in this election to be the big winners\nAnd there are currently to Nineteen Nineteen Ninety two percent and oppose and they could be the second strongest party in Bavaria for the first time\nRunner I can really you want to jump ship I was just that I'm speaking to the very front in Germany a couple of days ago and she was looking at about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green both of you know you're just there sure the old foreign minister from ten years ago the rub the sort of ... this is the role of the most radical fundamentalists started the green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually off a little bit different they the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know there are anti racist I mean at and are part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday too\nBoth of you know you're ... you're the old foreign minister from ten years ago the rubber sill to ... this is the role of the most radical fundamentalists started the green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often it's a bit differently the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know\nThere are anti racist I mean at and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance snakes like forty thousand people turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nSo they're they're pro tolerance there pro environment you know ... you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people that are more interested in that kind of the main politics I've also heard people say you know I didn't mean that they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they are they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be in those parties\nIt's interesting you isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\n[noise] and well it's because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided the the ah the country\nIt's divided the way people think they're a lot of people who don't want people coming in to people who are doing very well particularly pensioners is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and and and taking their money so to speak [noise] they're also worried about a loss of\nAnd their their sense of ... see no their culture and they're afraid at part of the thing that the ... say they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries on to this is a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor and that caller on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope show\nJust looking back to a report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with the topic of immigration but the last speaker and that was George on June of founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she will speak on that I did I thought it was\nThis is a thing with a lot of people who are worried about the uh the flavor and the car and a sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows to sticking with this topic of immigration but the last speaker and that was George entered a founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant what's your take on that I did I thought it was\nParticularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative and um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more clan to sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nSo your sense of what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in ... Stein forms of migration I'm an income\nUm and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to to to be at more danger\nUm so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't I don't know why this happened\nBecause you're you're right I've heard this perspective before why would someone with you to ... an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to the kind of I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the offenses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who look like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic flights\nThe cross the ... have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective though migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the offenses you know there's a finite resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who look like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way of the world\nAround them is it your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue is immigration and China will\nThe really big issue there is no immigration in the sense of people from outside China coming in but internal migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build buildings Welk on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor ... China but those people are often not properly documented they can't claim for welfare pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problems facing chimes today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the b._b._c.

China and Rob ... daily Liberia and also um academic and rush or a book about corruption\nPanama there's a lot of money but it flushing around out there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about really big sums of money and really big organizations\nYou know that um I Know well I'm a writer Arthur in ...\nYou're talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale this isn't just bribing elected official you're talking about really big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah that um I Know well I'm a father in law under him talk about the local level which is extremely important\nAt the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure that uh banks for or a lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts of money billions of dollars that go into\nDetails you know laundering or into a contract so one of the biggest of their schemes was in Latin America where billions of dollars were spent ... Brooks audio you wanted\nTo come in here yeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples out because I mean although Transparency International has that corruption perception index with look which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nUm the United nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at it listed financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've gotten billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the continent through\nYou know invading taxes through transfer pricing I'm mostly from polar foreign multinationals then you have you know they'll do with the leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence based more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tens fancy international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption Rona\nYou mentioned corruption in Africa or the other the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that that was eating China that rocking story I did meet John it you know I\nThink one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of a series of high profile arrest this time ... who was the head of into pole may seem to being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAnd in a sense what China's been doing particularly the last year oh say with the setting up with something called the national see position condition is what you might call empty transparency there's this huge crackdown it's very much to put a little ...\nThey want to be in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that that was what you mean China that sorry I didn't mean China you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of a series of high profile arrest this time ... who was the head of into pole may seem to be picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAnd innocence what China's been doing particularly the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national see position commission is what you might call empty transparency there's this huge crackdown but it's very much the product\nOf a north or carrying state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and just basically putting the frightened as a large numbers of wealth people not just officials but movies cells even the famous Chinese movie star who was\nAnd hidden away for three months until she came out in the ... tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author Terry in kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey will from I ... I I think in part atmosphere [noise] Casey visit earned about ... can you hear me just try again you can\nBuy our embassy international called ... or ... the national supervision commission the systematic threat to human rights in China which we agree with that\nAnd people without trial without access to a lawyer for six months for having an organization that you can appeal to the Supreme Court is probably not the way to go from ... I'm\nSorry I think the light of little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I was a question or a few um and in fact Rob do\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world do the work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there is a small cabal of very small\nGroup of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less a financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout um but I think there is a way to fight uh\nSome of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less a financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parent beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long run up\nAnd I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in the Sandy corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront for countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways for cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with ... and a half to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International there are sort of a a newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption on a major scale by a movie star in China just tell me about\nThat ... it's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie star will celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and she disappeared in July reappeared on E. three months later and very mysterious circumstances with the tax bill\nFor a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost as high as the b._b._c. present the salary I Believe yeah but I Do [laughter] well of course but it's basically a sign that China is willing in this case to basically make examples of incredibly famous incredibly well and then people\nTo give the idea that new but he remains on touch of course many of these people one suspects of people who have fallen foul or the Chinese leadership so it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment the state of ... wealth showing off your wealth is no longer perhaps in fashion then that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nWrote to last on this point if you have to sum up in ... seconds we do have a lot of young listeners on the BBC\nIt's basically a sign that China is willing in this case to basically make examples of incredibly famous incredibly well and then people to give the idea\nThat new but he remains untouched of course many of these people one suspects that people who have fallen foul of the Chinese leadership so it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment the state of contagious wealth\nShowing off your wealth is no longer perhaps in fashion and that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nRupture lost on this point if you have to sum up inside the seconds we do have a lot of low young listeners on the b._b._c.

interesting about this case it really is it comes out of this outgrowth of a de colonization pan African his movement across the continent where people are looking at colonial structures\nBe they buildings or names of streets I'm fly the line just recently changes need to fly teeny to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the Rosenthal movement at the University of Cape Town with black

say there's two reasons why respectfully\nMoving at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it pits that make violence um whereas you know racist policies across the university

the city of blind time change 'cause I think that's an alternate ditched his name but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said that Gandhi has nothing to do with Africa in fact ... for having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress across very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan citizen existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of mess\nNon violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course ... we had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved completely ... says when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how ... developed means that they're not saints that human beings who deserve respect and gun has as much to say to Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\nIs interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across ... how we are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yeah you're you're absolutely right that that's the power perspective isn't it\nRonald ten seconds from you

this may be a positive thing for you anyway I mean he might performed better on the football field or your example the interview you feel like is something that brings you could lock it just a

relationship to the living breathing pass\nTo one question I think where it's yeah it's really stumped me I mean I ... I came into thinking you know I'm a rational amount of science degree I Know that there are these ... this is the real bearing on the real physical world but I actually find it hard to bring myself to do that either I learned\nYou know we don't need to send me ... says yesterday did yeah so I think like me and the princes a couple of them out\nIt actually doesn't that any real relationship to the living breathing pass\nMission to one question I think when it's yeah it's really stumps me I mean I ... I came in thinking you know I'm a rational enough science degree I Know that there are these ... this is how the other real bearing on the real physical well but I actually find it hard to bring myself to either I learned\nTo semi suffice has yesterday did yeah\nSo I think like me and I printed a couple of them out of\nYour mom and your brother is\n\nYou have to just to see [noise]\nWith you on Iona succumb to it I think it's similar wishing it'll somebody you're not going to be able to actually change that live bring up something about thinking about that but\nWould you want to it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to to not\nDo that you have to think about it is very common thing Rachel mentioned several emotional\nThing today and when you do and to not check 'em you any psychologically changing something in your south to the ocean and during it\nThanks to Sophie page and no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the mail for that to mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though a new Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nEnter Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking my way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs\nAre really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or a tribute to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process\nThe ... Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking my way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work\nAnd so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or choose to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example who are always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit in the museum about two and um but producing a very cruel he brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was off before I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it oh just so chasing it with the outcome of anything but up next to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew us\nThink of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit of amusing about voodoo and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off default words like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with the bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources or sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air and what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the error recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes for you\nTimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I\nWant you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what do you go for\nYou should go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a okay this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade there on ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile thought they could really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice that between the intuition and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and an sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid does not do it\nIgnoring your intuition so much ... than the idea\nOf the costs I explain my experience with the food too so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition I said this is going to be really bad if I ... through a picture of a loved one that's a big cost so I'd rather avoid done not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you are having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying at\nPlease email it to crowd science or BBC does seal the u._k. thanks for listening to die and good luck

you know ...\n... are also some develop\nA upper level\nAnd so if we ever get into a stalemate in terms of inter Korean and us North Korea dialogue in the future so yeah so then I Believe European

European coal and steel community and culminated in the form of the European Union or\nCould have lost in the film like why so I Believe in order to establish a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula will eventually need to establish a north East Asia and multilateral\nPeace and security architecture so regarding the efforts and history of integration in Europe I'm really looking forward

any ... about the sexual stay thin saying you're saying that comes on and says it sold any fish and give us as to whether or not maybe\nOh you've done Trump all that from first of all it is well known that President Trump as busy campaigning for the midterm election shows up and get them where\nHe's already gone on record saying that he thinks the second us North Korea summit will be held after the midterm elections are you ... I Believe that currently working level negotiations are ongoing as to determine the time and a venue for the upcoming us North Korea summit\nI'm gonna tell you that I wouldn't have much at all I was in the\nCable look forward to hearing more about\nAnd when it comes out in your previous on that theme holding condoning how you're a farmer human rights lawyer does it know sadly ... to hold\nOff the leader of the country with one of the ... lights that cuts and wild\nOh ... I Do believe that the human rights of the people in North Korea is a very important issue and I believe that North Korea and needs to work towards the path of universal human rights\nUdall for ...\nCould have however I Do believe that promotion of human rights through international pressure\nIs not very effective and in order to achieve substantive improvements in the human race left a North Korean people we need to engage in inter Korean cooperation as less cooperation between ... and the international society\nCan you go to a ball or\nIt's a very important issue and I believe that

pressure\nIs not very effective and in order to achieve substantive improvements in the human rights of the north Korean people we need to engage in inter Korean cooperation as less cooperation

allow so it gives him some\nThrough these measures I Believe will be able to see much further improvements in the human rights of the north Korean people\nI guess I'm not on she doesn't mean the word I Will send a hundred dollars a year\nAnd it's ... the United nations secretary general also came out saying that he looks forward to seeing the inter Korean dialogue having a positive effect on the improvements of the human rights of the people in North Korea and I'm of the same opinion\nOf ...\nAnd one final question if that pet care at how thing after I think\nYou can leave the European Union ... willing to take down a turn on or\nYou will I Hope that even after Brexit will be able to retain to free trade agreement relationships with the United kingdom you know 'cause they were all just\nFigure and I do hope that the negotiations between the United kingdom and the European Union and the well so that we'll be able to maintain these relationships\nWoman I get here just is going to get on with them even if these negotiations do not go well I Believe that we will be able to engage in consultation with the United kingdom side regarding the issue of maintaining the free trade agreement\nWill things have moved on since I use the metal ... hanging as my collar area if you're here's a guy\nBecause now we're talking about ... minutes or you can spray or even paint them on the

up with an ... like the one on your ... is it really that simple\nWell if it for that same poll I Would not take us through years then right\nOr to develop exam but as soon as they know how to get flakes or is that right size with ... ... ... how to me in ... contact each has a veil and conduct electricity as that continues field\nHas been on how to make the films so seeing that becomes translucent or even transparent instill conducts any piece that you now have to have you on food it really becomes seem\nSo it does mean that you show them that you can get mental that can be painted

on the\n... ... almost any measure this snakes harm the Daniel Kohn bite my since may soon as they have the ... and common interim ant once it's so simple\nSimple but so it does mean that you showed

in those surfaces such a symbol stick even does that mean for example the trees and buy plasma before\nBut so you end up with films that are safe than that practically transparent what kinds of uses might this kind of Maxine antenna have\nWell as you can see in our modern world gets more and more connected [noise] for example uh we are a token now are using Skype one of my computer\nI have my cell phone that should two different cell phones late next to me and our car but communicates is our ... our communicate to\nUm was a lot of difference in ... also communicating to chosen for example at our fate did tax which keep ... items safe in department stores\nOr advance the credit card or ... or ... your hotel rooms where instead of my ... and there is a ... attack which allows\nLong

world we need to have an Dennis ... communications for too much placed everywhere and ...\nAnd sometimes even transparency miserable and of course it should be easy to put them on the surface\nAnd we believe this is exactly we are this type for for a brief double or spray ... antennas may appear to be useful also in many cases or we need our newspapers or close this to bend so we want to have an

particularly useful\nThat eureka go see a in buildings and giving a sense of some of the use as many uses the intimate things you have these very flexible spray on an centers of magazines\nAnd

France has made it clear that that will be absolutely whatever is delivered by the u._k. will be delivered by frogs is all shrimp freezer say well we like how you should lose shift so much that we will give them exactly the same rights as they have now regardless of what the UK decides about eve citizens in the United kingdom\nQuite honestly at the at present the twenty seven are United in that position with regard to the negotiations with the United kingdom and the efforts clearly focused on citizens both will be citizens in the u._k. and the same way as British citizens um in in the twenty seventh [noise]\nUm ... what do you think should will happen\nWhen actually I Hope that we will find a solution [noise] actually I person and hope that there would be a second referendum ... [laughter] you're not\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] because\nIt's not on democratic to say that now that we know what is at stake and now what is that what what lives they were told about that and we have a second referendum but um I Would say would be very clever to to say that you will keep the same rights of course because I mean ostrich should be interested to keep people have you here and also I Would say but\nIt's the government's turn ever been in the same rights\nThe potential [laughter] you're not getting\n[noise] because\nIt's not on democratic to say that now that we know what is at stake and now what is that what what lives they were told about that we have a second referendum but I Would say would be very clever to to say that you will keep the same rights of course because I mean ostrich should be interested to keep\nPeople have you here and also I Would say but it's the government's turn ever been in the\nSame rights because otherwise the whole systems of her education\nResearch a unit was it is that's really the main problem because uh the whole exchange or in the hospitals Bruce programs\nThat ... would be ... free uh one is willing to work it will be really for the whole system of higher education science research universities in\nAll ... will be catastrophic if you send the whole euro hole yeah and the whole yourself do you believe the ultra\nCould under those circumstances given the impact on Austria could say regardless of what the other twenty six EU member states do we will grants to UK citizens here exactly the same terms as they have at the moment\nWhich is implicit in our questioner\nI we discussed is if you go and I said uh the European Union children don't make this for people from uh the United kingdom but for all people from the commonwealth\nOkay I'm I'm ... plus riding\nOn this issue we like people to is being said but as I understand them the mesh middle states doesn't pissed renewed freedom that we are in the union and both the union besides we have to do for low no of course\nYou have to ... you can you're allowed to have your own a circle\nAnd legal and we we we can give them citizenship according\nTo all alone what your phone but one ... one important question you could say well we're as Austrians or us as the republic of us are you going to have\nTo attract maybe citizens from the u._k. afterwards even if there is no agreement so we do is I don't I look for it and they rely on hold for like three minutes but of course he would have somebody to\nAbout ... ... is the beginning that but we ... we can use our into a new legal system of giving citizenship that we'll we'll\n... yes but one one important question you could say well we're as Australians or us as the republic of us are you going to have to attract maybe citizens from the u._k.\nAfterwards even if there is no agreement so I don't I look for it like right now I Know for us but of course we have somebody to\nA to B c's union law in the beginning that but we are not words we use our into a legal system with giving citizenship that we'll\nWe'll go we'll go to our next question which comes from ...

I I agree with the portion but an adult not agree with that tilt totally free contraception that mean for some young people yes but you know everything for free I I think it's problematic X Y y\nY know frequent tests you managed to shouldn't get things for nothing to\nWell I think I'm a weather for ... for ... young women it is good to have free contraception but I I think is not necessary to have it for long women but I\nForgot to very clear cut position for a politician of your ... your when you think it's good here for ... for younger ... for women\nTo call it a point is is it affordable you have to have the situation where it's not affordable you have to do you want as a politician he wants I totally understand that they want to um stop the problems in those cases where people cannot afford it\nI'm going to go to our audience on this issue ends up the words that people have one comment on this petition and its validity its value\nAny women in the audience who would like to have a word about this yes it's run by that and to see a hand up on the left hand side by\nThree rose from the back\nNation on the referendum in a country where the gender pay gap is over twenty percent and we are at the\nEnd of the scale in Europe and it's shameful for any woman not to sign this referendum and for any man\nNot to sign this referendum the thirty hours a week for me is just a detail because coming into a new world of new work and digital ... and it's very likely working hours are going to fall anyway so not very visionary I'm afraid with all due respect any any women here who who I had and they were here [noise]\nAny any women here\nIs another woman over that who have will have not signed the petition or why\nHigh um\nTo sign this referendum the thirty hours a week for me is just a detail because coming into a new world of new work and digital ... and it's very likely working hours are going to fall anyway so not very visionary I'm afraid with all due respect any any women here who who I have [noise]\nAny any women here\nIs another woman over that who have have not signed the petition or why\nHigh um I\nFind very interesting that you never touched a to point of abortion you're talking about contraception but abortion is not to even mentions retiring and there's lots of talking about that ... is a great point you have not touched in mind that you shouldn't", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "14"}
