that is how we were able to create chai labels free communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities when no children look what she means is that the work that doing no longer into the school\n\nLike type ... and she says somewhat can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform it's all about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come onto the document

continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give the child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases our responsibility when they're working with children died at least you don't let them take that one decision and then\nForget them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life [noise]\nThan our human children's council throughout

extensively about the revolution that he believes has already gone\nWhen you think about why the smartphone both iPhone and Android happened two thousand and seven the reason is that there was a technology convergence all the technologies that made a six hundred dollars smartphone possible\nHappened two thousand and seven similarly uh by two thousand Twenty one or so\nWhen the convergence of autonomous\nElectric and on demand\nSo imagine an over without a driver and electric that virgins we'll essentially means that costs of transportation per kilometer will be tens\nOf the cost of owning your Petra car electric vehicles have twenty moving parts versus about two thousand moving parts for the patrol car\nWhich means they're ten times cheaper to maintain it costs of charging an electric vehicle is also\nTen times cheaper than the cost of living a better car on a per mile bases and the last five hundred thousand miles as opposed to just a hundred and forty thousand miles for the federal ... when you're over and you drive a car a hundred thousand miles per year\nOver five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half for three patrol car\nAnd then you take a driver out of the equation then the cost goes down further three or four times\nSo you combine that on demand\nAutonomous and electric and you get paid ten times decrease in the cost\nAnd these satellite powerful arguments you'll say this is starting in twenty twenty on you know you say two three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't William we don't ready just on the revolution that you describe happening\nWe do and if you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S west a hundred thousand

you describe happening\nWe do and if you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla model free for fifty thousand dollars so it's come down by half\nEssentially they're going to be cheaper than buying petrol car by about twenty twenty for half the market and essentially by all of that market by about twenty twenty five\nNow car companies aren't getting it after denial for the last few years they're all announcing that they're investing tens of millions of dollars\nInto an

correspondent Jonathan markets there Jonathan a lot of finger pointing at Russia coming from many different directions what are we expecting to come out of this meeting\nI think this could be something of a turning point in time I think the willingness of a number of countries now\nIs the point the finger directly at the Russian state or to provide a more and more evidence of a whole range of cyber attacks against organizations in multiple countries\nThat does seem to be something relatively new uh it has been going on for very long time but as I say that willingness to name and shame if you like that is new\nTo the question of course is what practical results that will be\nI think we're going to see a lot of talk here and they talk about who laying a cyber defense ... about trying to spread a defensive cyber capabilities are around the alliance and beyond to countries who are very much the focus of Russian attacks\nOr the real big question I suppose which people do want to talk

Russians\nBut we've seen or the alleged intrusions into the U.S election campaign or virtually no election takes place now or in a western democratic country without concerns about this kind of a a cyber or electronic intrusion\nThere are more water campaigns overtime to influence a public opinion\nTo denigrate twisted institutions to raise questions in people's minds about\nTheir own politicians that policy is now up to a point you know that goes on in society anyway as part of a normal free flow of political debates but when it says to the extent being orchestrated from outside with the order of the resources employed\nOn the Internet the Twittersphere and so on it does become something that is inherently destabilizing\nJonathan Marcus in Brussels now what does Russia make
