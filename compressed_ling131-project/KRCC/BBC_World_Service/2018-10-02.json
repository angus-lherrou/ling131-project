businesses who say you're taking a long have you been away from us\nSo in this ... you have potential to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking their business over the\nCourse here my points you had what we find is obviously\nPoliticians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nI'm what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair up and get to assess tend to be told to calm the retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take care of some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in the ... cafe down have those skills\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get prepared back in to our daily lives is that the professional repair should become cheaper\nNow for many people repair professional repair it's too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and ... so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that\nA professional repair to become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different labor costs in different pulses of welfare so\nYou're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet [noise]\nAfter listening for\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work in terms of course we're allowing

enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd of\nCourse there will be different labor costs in different policies of welfare so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAbsolutely I mean\nOne thing I Want to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work and just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that I was only found out when I paid a visit to a landfill saw the other day I have a listen to this why\nWon't become to protest today and I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThis is the gold and children's brigade yet he found that tax break at the yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair all well I don't know if he's a so frightened ... holes in the ... and he's not what I mean I Wonder when someone could replace a mental pause\nIt might be able to taste and buy from even though there are just I just think it's just easier to get rid of it they might they might have been able to take the time as well during the time yeah fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just started writing sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it that was\nTo loosen camera stuff you know\nWhen you put on a lens and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um Georgia a point where they can't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so ... to the bottom could you repair them or is\nThat you can try but not really much point that it wasn't anything to take it to patients cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the ultimate equipment it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that vast with in working order about twenty quit in ... or somewhere like that and to repair it was a little hemorrhage ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour lenses here and we're going to put them in the world this was this little applause has been no I've already been up here and how to look in this regard\nWe should really be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is does only says secrecy did\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if the new equipment is going to be generally cheap and and now with a quick money doesn't buy the joke\nAnd when you buy or somewhere like that to repair it was a real hair it been ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and say we're going to put them in the world is is this a little bit you know I've already been up here not looking here we go\nWe should really be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is designing says secrecy date\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if the new companies could be generally cheaper than able to put money doesn't buy the joke [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder you know ...\nPeople have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy but just starting to have the time\nYeah obviously of people are pretty busy day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around or whoever he conscious about their environment that saying that we get in some parts we get ... dress phones because\nPeople want to do the bench in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing the lord of the food so that things don't go to lunch in\nMost you know I Wonder if you could kind of a ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because you know they're already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people how do you correct\nMe other people who as we heard from people like at the tip who are quite happy just to throw support\nWell that's a challenge of course\nBut we hope to get them into the ... cafe when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that when it's a precious broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you type and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWe're running short time now for ... cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing the machine that pulled apart as a chapter with a large Sean again into the workings of the device some final thoughts on from every once in a way to solve it going to be ten Fifteen Years time\nI think that will be more repack I faced because they'll they'll\nIt really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWe're running short time now ... cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a machine that pulled it Paul there's a chapter with a light shining and into the workings of the device some final thoughts and from every ... months in a way to solve it can be in ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be Morrie cafes because they'll they'll\nBut we also hope that the manufacturers realize that that should be re bearable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you could principles bad policy\nTo fix the things that you don't have the whole stretch away that movie challenging but maybe in the future you love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean I think the future prepackaged face is much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe yeah it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships hunting slow people down for a little while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken items with Paris hits it hits connecting people with each other [noise]\n\nMy thanks to everyone to Tina I'm Petra here and put them to Chris in London and Chevy ... in Bangalore\nThank you for this thing too

this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor got away suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than splashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we wanted to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. have also taken to activism have personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take too much in the founder and chairman of the British pub chain whether spoons as a long time you were a skeptic he came out ahead of the British referendum on EU membership in twenty sixteen as\nAn ... even stuck that message on these pub PMS how does that affect the best sales I wanted well\nWe'd been fairly apolitical it with a spoon for the first twenty or so years of our existence and the first thing that cool ma I was the debate over the euro and that is what started the bull rolling so campaign successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given a choice like everyone else had to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for our company and decided to campaign just snowball\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another just to get on your band mats and to decorate your various problems with that message\nWell that's right of course there were a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the foot sea hundred companies signed a lesser saying we'll definitely be better off if we stay in the EU\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean is one thing to go on the media and an express your personal opinion it's another given that you

about it I'd already done ... during the ... the euro era and the euro debate\nAnd the way that I think people except to do is unlike side of the Financial Times or the times of the guardian in a magazine which is where I wrote a lot of my articles\nWe had articles arguing the opposite of what I was saying so I think it helped us so that we can say we are and organized ... which here's my view but we will print an equal number of articles with the opposite view\nRight but the man that's a pretty one sided these days on me\nYeah the beer match you're right the ... are more one sided that they made the case for leave and I think people believe debates is required if you're going to make a good decision\nAnd the debates is part of a democracy not everyone agrees with me over his late

basically we're in a situation where the petitions are looking at the ramifications of last night's two things went on\nYesterday we had seen the huge protests through the streets hundred and eighty thousand people largely peaceful\nAnd then separately you've got a grassroots organization of independence activists some say a more extreme and the CD all the committee for the defense of the

o'clock last night\nAnd the group protests just go to the doors of parliament they look to be storming parliament's at one point and riot police came in\nUm ... we used to be using some projectiles that brief clashes push them back\nAnd I think what's happening now of ramifications looking at the slightest a fault line now in the independence movement which is is you have the president came to

us from Barcelona when groups of whales are found floundering on beaches usually that means they got lost and confused and sometimes they can be guided back out to sea bought the discovery of sixty eight trivia whales dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem with uh put it into context two years to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to Andrew Brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... usual mortality events because I'm the carcasses that are coming in I shall incredibly decomposed so [noise]\nUm we we are she had an investigating this last month pathology point of view and moved from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed off and then they die that dead when they reach the surface\n[noise] yes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales are such a [noise]\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold mass running events why are we to end up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the last uh some of them on the beach some of them alive some of them that [noise]\nUm and we investigate to try and work out why they're strong thing happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidence of\nI'm a very unusual species that's being washing up a light from the sort of the the go away by an island\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turn up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the water some of them on the beach some of them alive some of them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out why they're struggling happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of\nI'm a very unusual species that's being washing up a light from the sort of the the go away by an island all the rights of the top of Scotland um so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea\nUm but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows how\nMany in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year [noise]\nSo in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a key as ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by ... by these these class substitutions\nUm and this year so far um we've had sixty eight to these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland and forty five alone in ... which\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the water don't they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible to speculate might be happening [noise] well\nThis is what makes us quite tricky because they um they as you say that there are species that live well off the shelf hedge so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they being ... to just a under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down the\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nI'm now there's the problem is is that when these animals wash his show is very limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because of in such a expensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise I'm human\nBecause that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these the square to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for this species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash his show is very limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because it in such a expensive states the decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species\nIs particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... noise in an in specifically effect to mid range segment on that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf hedge\nI'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bought them\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time but something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed it does I mean we we've we've made the oceans vi noisy place in a not so the sense of a general problem in this specific case\nFrom them we have is is that they ... out of the people that off the lights the made right inside an all off in the military\nAnd loving information from than can be quite challenging um the reason that the military ... a an a sudden this frequencies is that is used for um communication on the association for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive it a national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be not pricing can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not this\nA noise is a plausible reason that these animals ... so we want to rule out all the other things that could potentially have caused them to strengthen such as toxins infectious disease I'm I'm trying to establish what what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\nSo many questions Andrew Brown the director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme on those sixty eight\nA trivia whales that big and they should be swimming about two kilometers

what's the risk is our democracy the milk our values and principles ... we'll see some follow what he's\nEver I'll do an unjust oh from the ... in Brazil ending that report from Tim Frank's in the northeast of that country well I've been speaking to professor Anthony Panetta he's director of the Brazil Institute at King's College in London what Brazilians voting for this time around\nThey go to a very complex ballot to deal with for the first round there Thirteen candidates for president um they've got a book for state deputies federal\nDeputies senators I think when it comes to the presidential election it's shaping up into two horse race between Fernando ... ... ... and those are that's a difficult choice for many Brazilian voters because of the nature of both the candidates and the parties that they come from\nHow much do Brazilians want to vote for this pack of politicians bearing in mind that Lula who you know once upon a time had the reputation of a U.S ally saint and is now in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes are excited or Brazilians about voting for any politician\nNot sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidate that they can find ... was that was sort of on auto pilot from the period Nineteen Ninety four to two thousand and ten you had a series of elections where\nWhen there was a second round of the presidential election it was a choice between a center right candidate innocent\nAnd is now in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the federal company and the buying of votes are excited Brazilians about voting for any politician\nI'm not sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidate that they can find Brazil was sort of on auto pilot from the period Nineteen Ninety four to two thousand ten you had a series of elections where\nWhen there was a second round in the presidential election it was a choice between a center right candidate an essential left candidate\nAnd they agreed on a lot of major policy issues and now you've got quite a hard right candidate enjoyable some out of\nSomeone who's economic advisor Paolo get isn't saying you know privatize every state owned enterprises that you can have a flat tax let's end affirmative action in universities lets the ideal or jazz or\nSchools teaching and so on and then you got for not to a dying Jean from the workers' party which rules from two thousand three to two thousand and sixteen and many people don't want to see back so you've got a hard core that would be very disappointed at either a dodgy horrible scenario presidency\nSo does that mean the ... who has a reputation for\nBeing very outspoken and very unpleasant ways talking about we had five children unfortunately one of them was go a kind of thing because at least he something different and the corruption tightened so many who are on the progressive side is he likely to win I think if you look at the polling\nWho was a new poll today that had the second round scenario had\nBoth ... and ... and a dodging a technical tied forty two percent each so he definitely has a chance to win the election we also said about the dictatorship of sixty four to eighty five the mistake of the dictatorship was to torture and not to kill\nIts opponents so he's got a very hard line stance on that and his vice presidential candidate General Motors now has talked about well maybe if there's too much disorder the military is going to have to close down Congress I Would say yes he has a chance to win\nIt may
