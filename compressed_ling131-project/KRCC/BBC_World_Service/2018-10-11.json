been trending earlier this year but why does she think that the phone will not exist\nOr I think it's because if each of them and around the world starts dictating to these big platforms ... isn't hate speech and that's going to be different in every single country\nSuddenly you aren't going to have a single global platform where all the same rules apply to everyone but you'll have national

percent of the couples divorce\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter

about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have a larger age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationship\nAre there very long these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually try not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people don't really in the corner of the the wedding hole instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have a larger age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationships\nBut this is not actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationships so\nThe big age difference could have been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for making comparing women and men in same sex

argue that one of the reasons given often was\nEven behind the scenes at discussions with political leaders especially from the so called developed countries was that you know we can deal with this

bigger and there's all kinds of scenarios that are getting closer to us that will wipe out the access to space capability because things have been raised on a warrior\nIt turns out that the major problem with space debris is that everything put up in space is legally owned by somebody\nAnd therefore every screw up there is owned by somebody that you have to get her legal release from 'em before you touching so that has to be worked for\nMy assume it will be okay that there is what what do you do that and I call it costs like beach called me\nAnd so what what you do is you go up there

collection there is another area that's become a hot topic in space comb us that mining Chris Louis is the founder and CEO of the U.S space thumb Planetree result is one of the world's first and leading prospective space mine that's\nThe last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general\nWe now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons and other solar systems we've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money being invested in space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved the way as it as it almost always does\nAnd with those points of inside the exploration\nBack from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society to to new places\nWhat are you going to mine from a space mining standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things and transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things\nOr you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge to a who's who may one right war to win or ice in the form of with what you find on

shipping very expensive heavy things\nOr you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge to a who's who may one right water or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids for target he's going to be about yeah water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I the water can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel\nIt's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit and top it off\nAnd take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like\nQuantities and we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the idea here 'cause there'll be a potential set at a station in space for a gas station in space for these bussing spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term ... because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from us fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a an ... SpaceX rocket kind of shooting them spaces\nIs actually a only a tiny fraction of the cost of the overall mission so he's he's a few really good deliverable that everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in Italy permanently and space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you don't feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that shuttle gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids and you're going to need a ...\nColony first I mean or at least an an active and sort of industry on a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nThis is what is the challenge in the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that sustainable to get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it it so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of it\nTwo GS synchronous orbiter farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need to call in the first I mean or at least ... and actually from sort of industry on a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken in the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects or their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computer so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that quick\nQuestion if you you go you've got your asteroid and your sites and you go up and you land on at the prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do and the luge besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several decades\nOr that is one of the challenges of working with afterwards as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it were easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution\nFor how soon will this happen it's happening now so you know you're going to have a pro bono starting to prospect on a particular restaurant\nThe first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nAbout five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and do you think the finances to yes absolutely a hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but uh five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale mind\nChristmas ... here on business daily from the BBC\nThese types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale money\n... here on business daily from the BBC\nLate and we discuss space
