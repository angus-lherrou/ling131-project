there is a important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nSo cold hard to it by sectors

development going on\nAnd as I was crossing our fingers innocent ...\nNo no the people working on this all across the world a new development going on there's a report you out of the end of November by the energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development of battery technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect of short flights being possible using ... technology at some point same with law a long distance trucking June\nTeasing out slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is coming you know those it's going to have to be allocated think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nYou know everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it\nThat they're actually putting things into you know

there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American my nationality right now hurricane

outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights with other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio Lewis\nIs just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes at the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what do we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think of the distribution of impacts of different policies that will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefits\nBe put in place to compensate for these short term law office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also now that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a harder time however we the appropriate policies of training we've are emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short term\n... cases if I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the transition was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five powers target for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that were previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to work to do that when I came to question who's going to appear to for\nThis one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable broke and we're not asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for the ones who can predict the one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay for ... for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing\nDifficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who's going to pay to for\nThis one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to pay for it for just one station today one should also balanced with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recon observing today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd recruit degree are forming due to smoke in the far future does this um one point five at the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed showed up they she the poor of the impacts of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to come back\nAnd yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or just made a lot has been done we have a Nineteen nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the ... and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly so these is making it easier\nThere isn't a global carbon price for instance it's agreed no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is\nThat it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize and there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had\nIs domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's this investment changing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it is not enough\nAh as they say the reports is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point that he's made also in the report about making\nMistake level policies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's nice invest managing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough\nAs they say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable are not hard it's not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there are three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current\nGrowth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive for\nWe designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRole of of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought so I Want to wrap up this how fast for now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ...

action all these factors and also a different way of uh of going about not pushing for but\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that it's a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for arguing or at four different policies\nMostly I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of you feel well you'll viewed as nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make a ... show when the twin daughters mega what's known as he compared to\nThe point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible damage deficient and cheapest way to do that through a new those\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nLet's hear from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make Mondays I PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints wanted them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this last\nWe'll have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level\nBut I I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck it with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is affected leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president\nI'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and it uses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that efficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide to date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states city some companies All Facts were still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states\nDesegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which he's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because it's the level rise and there's a good chance the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has been gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending you know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies ah\nWhere Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some program stripe to zero at the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that is growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a loss in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficient see on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas\nIn the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection and I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough and\nWhat I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help and so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel\nDoesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of all do that a country that's growing is simply not polices it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate\nIt's not going fast enough and\nWhat I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health and so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with\nYou and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments ... that

... public uh and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money\nWe'll still able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month to come to the store you know you long investigation on his name is really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was founded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier it was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often then managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according\nTo their statements that police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten\nWhen the ... began on than girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts and talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh wants one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care\nFor so when the ... came to light the organization essentially said\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mine and organization who died an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered to an end centrally said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures in a challenging context may have contributed\nTo his ability to access and abused young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but that trial ended in how would you do and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so what we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten\nVictims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nWhat's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate do you know if there'll be any changes of told me\nBut the girls would be ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so what we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we

for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place that's certainly true that the organization\nSought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls were for the first time according to their statements that the\nPolice so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the blow break hit Liberia at that time subsequently Katie mile or who's the head of the organization was named attain person with a year\nWithin six months that these rapes in her organization coming to like\n[noise] and that was journalist I'm\nEugene Fidell young speaking to me um\nThe school foundation of gold molded me has made the statement you looked into fourteen timbre of girls named John some of the abuse of both of

has the only state funded inpatient each soldier unit in South Africa\nShe told me that well the fast cases of eating disorders amongst black South African women with documented in the Nineteen nineties that hasn't seen enough for such since then ... seconds on the scale of the problem will die\nThat are definitely a sense um that it it is increasing the exposure to western culture is something that seems to influence the likelihood of one developing an eating disorder\nWe seeing especially in the younger population who live in the ... it's an area is going to make schools that are linked to associated eating disorders thinking so a lot of concern around race in shape losing weight\nA visiting the pro anorexic or believe me quit sides so that within the culture influence is

disorders [noise]\nFull and LA westernized nation is a major factor in the rise of eating disorders amongst the population [noise] but some doctors are wary of putting too much emphasis on infants

B. S. addressed all of this and he said the Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing\nOn with continuous progress in all elements and he actually said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay\nIn that area it's better than ... paying a very big bent to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been\nIn the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen seventies so the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly\nAnd rights if there was a small price to pay in that area it's better than ... paying a very big debt to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been\nIn the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen seventies so the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but\nIsrael now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had and so you've seen the substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steven I think that there is growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be\nAn entirely reckless inhumane\nBeef steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that\nWith the the problem with the Saudis have cause any ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen with American weapons I think in the United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nI at the Saudis can't develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr could show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some a teen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and vote for any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... walls and sixty percent of Saudi arms import that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia\nIs really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should\n... and sixty percent of Saudi arms import that relationship is so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether you believe that the Congress for example is now going to ask them really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia\nIs really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment ever on but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia about his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening\nA Saturday influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed by the use of American weapons\nBy the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis\nAnd I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula ...\nIrish sheet we have talked to some length about the number of prisoners that MBBS his looks out for this and I think you figure in the thousands\nIncluded in that number at least for a while with some very senior members of the family and close associates of the family some of whom were famously looked up in the Ritz Carlton and including all will lead been to allow one\nOf Saudi Arabia's biggest businessman Nicholas Burns Oscar interesting question about just how secure NBS his grip on power is what do you think\nWell secure at crown prince who had already be guaranteed that he's got to be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the lame hammock this man had behaved especially act towards his phone cousins\nIn addition to that ... there was an important facts and I've been I've done the whole end of the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base and security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household\nHis grip on power is what do you think\nWell secure a crown prince who had already guaranteed that he's got to be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way my husband said man had behaved especially towards his own cousins\nIn addition to what it looked a lot there was unimportant ... I've been up the ... the head of the national guard and Saudi Arabia he had a military base\nOn security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the art installations\nBut if some time I'd been sentiment is secure in his position he wouldn't really result to these kinds of erratic acts\nThe war in Yemen it's been going on for almost like four years\nAnd we have seen no end to the bombing using west and a ministry equipment\nAnd also expertise let's not forget that are people from the United states and from the ministry in Britain from the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have heard that without us and you can support that this war in Yemen would not continue for more\nThan ... the Saudi Government continues to frame by war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between\nSaudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians are framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported the groups in Lebanon and Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it at a press a regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest forced him to resign to this that bin Laden yet another country in the middle east\nAnd for it to protect probably another immigration and added a few crisis\nTo go that far without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting a certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support is unbelievable\nHave to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young ... let's call them the ruler of a ...\nTo resign to defend that either yet another country and then it it is and I think that's probably another integration and ... and after the crisis\nTo go that far without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy put things at certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support it's unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country NBS there's just thirty three years old he controls\nPretty much all the leaves of power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains ... Lee wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other to the the strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt\nInstability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia state I think we're looking at\nAlmost a Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform or by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side\nYou see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other Saturdays and and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turn\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world would have close relations with the kingdom\nYou've been hoping for some sort of change in Saudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed moment\nNot under the leadership of ... I've lost hope that that is called for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we had the story of free form for several decades and that the more ... more stays the same and in fact we are seeing what scenarios\nRight there simply because we have heard the story of reform for several decades and that the more reforms in the morning stays the same and in fact we are seeing worst scenarios\nBut at the New York times you quote you decide that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to New York times that that sort of default response to be well they hate the president that they will run this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be\n... and say that it's not political because we're we're writing into a political world but it's just not what we do Washington is going to say what

absence of a political fall out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to finance media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as senior editor at the financial news says Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about financing markets for the Financial Times newspaper he\nWrote a swan song article for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media the immediate response to the New York times story he argues is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the major in the most important institutions that got the color you've seen trust collapse [noise]\nThere are various reasons for that plane leave the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved\nWas unfair many people left behind those responsible was punished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody is behaving well anyway [noise]\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has\nThere is a loss of trust in ... and ... on preparedness to believe actual empirical fact lots of that possibly does come from the rise of social media but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe\nThe established means you're over ... stood in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that\nSpecifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an on preparedness to believe actual empirical

almost paternalistic to think that\nSomebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed essentially that with a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the AT T\nIs a this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was very very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in my city bank account because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible protected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people in\nSmart suits trying to a shovel their money around to protect it\nNow that looked like a bank credit technically wasn't they weren't actually taking their money out at the right but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we hits tried publicizing this it would've been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this than we are going to get in trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's going to look for say with infighting panic\nBanker on basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there is also confidence and you've got to be really really short of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nThat just because you didn't report it at the time\nDid not reports that the climate didn't particularly series tickets meets do say and ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about this\nSo where in fighting panic\n... basically inside thing about ...\nYes exactly which

ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about an ... by the sheer level of invective and the anger vis arose opinion against me was you know at least\nFor one five to one against a very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nPeople saw it as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media sources like the F T where I was at the time of the New York times acting as a responsible Phil set of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is as if they ... points I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking a furniture and it would have been out there on social media and that she's ... now regarded as ... as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nSince

Washington An incredibly still waiting to hear how that develops you're listening to well to update from London [noise]\n\nThis is Dan Damon with wild updates there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and the use of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them in from the University of cancer brand new Zealand after most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of that is that as you say we expect herbicides ... plan and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of the different kinds of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this\nThe weeds and antibiotic resistance\nLeaf surprise and all of that is is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the kind of bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are for toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapted bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is underway and the most harmless of sounding places anyway told the Bronx loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where they're stroked that puts herbal side and application levels on their hands and they may touched their mouth\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done and professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of anyone\nThe latest study we found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together the development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done and professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria and these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that ask these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us and to\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemical\n[noise] can you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak kind them in more than a million people were killed during eight years
