market\nRight so the Irish border is really big impasse over these negotiations and I'm just wondering with the with the headline today\nSo now with the White House getting rid of this visit level the playing field for you\nThis is a major step to level the playing field\nThat's in large part because the agreement itself as a one country one vote system in which China is considered still basically a developing country that becomes a very difficult problem to solve it uh one country one vote system because China can simply vote against your proposal to move them into a developed nation status\nThat's Patrick Patrick ... of the national association of manufacturers in the United states not many thanks [noise]\n\nMineral is being discovered inside a ... in Western Australia\n[noise]\nI mean we're in mineral is being discovered inside a ... in Western Australia the ... only being detected before when China America Germany and Canada to discover including a lot of excitement in the science world because it might just hold some of the secrets of planet or as we know it including how the dinosaurs became extinct\nNow live from puff Australia to do to Iran ... who heads a team of researchers like cutting university and it made the discovery thanks for talking to us on a news day um first of all just kind of a little bit more ...\n[noise] uh it's my pleasure thanks a ... a microscopic mineral the forums when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact it's very rare\nAnd we'll put a source of impacts are we talking about here\nWell read I can form out a couple of different sizes impacts but the site we founded in Western Australia near shark bay along\nThe coast or is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class\nAnd part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides are discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class event that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to us and that is what you have a a peanut butter sandwich\nYeah the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamp\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried ... and when we want to study it today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes uh to uh\nAbove all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes uh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called Woodley we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter\nSo it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice the size it's a big event society soft aren't mostly thank you very much in deep which will continue to\n[noise] now in about Ninety minutes time world updates going to be live here on the world service standing is here to tell us what's coming up\nIs ...

heard of ... tell us about her story and why it was so remarkable\nWell thanks for having me I knew or as a ... to me because like I put into you know Indian impacts on the origin I'm an immigrant I came here the u._k. when I was five and growing up I I heard about this story and it just became more residents to me\nAnd it struck me that very few people knew about whether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning and white British\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born in India and father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer in power\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born to an Indian father an American mother\nAnd she was actually a children's

essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah I don't know when the nine ...\nAnd one of the leading ones because what happened was the stock goes doctor to round up um their spy

know about it and and and with regards to your program you know there is a wider debate society right now but you know what's taught in our curriculum\nYou know why don't you know knowing more

army so this is about why to professional representation there's never been in the minority ethnic\n... there is so much I mean there's so much going for that campaign and there is there's been a lot

school of economics that actually did that was how to handle the crisis was old fashioned getting in economics\nAnd to a number of people made that point people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession they weren't\nUsing frumpy or economics or the guy that gets stolen graduate schools\nThey are using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the surgeries did rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis I like to the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close ... there were seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on we're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christian is with a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them\nBrought home to many out of touch the professional had become Wendy colon is the most of widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books must not subjects that we huge Lee important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published\nTime writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way that correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think that was true or not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics class rooms\nRemember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend\nIf they give bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these windy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cool who to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier to comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what\nPeople want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by bank because that can threaten them financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end\nIgnoring the biggest elephant in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment sets\nIn tire early unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this is changed following the crisis\nYou hear is more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up\nYou know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible like this before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my bass can prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives that miss\nUsed his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work in the seventies and eighties [noise] advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone ... sells things in the self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and\nThe banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior\nSomebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students\nThe markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs ... only works if you mentioned all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to be calling me can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith spinner argue for traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity to be self centered so unlike

decision making he's this sort of rational big calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of a set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a

altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant they said not anything that we need to studying economics days like ... the same things that we have

with that\nI think that's true I think you know as I said we access what stuff I\nHad when we come and help us I was equally we were looking at well soften Instagram it was say in our minds that distinction becomes blood and we probably don't switch off with us we would have done in the old days where\nWe left for work and there was no puts ability to connect with the office except for the phone call what happened then is already that people's right to privacy in the home\nFrom work has already being some diminished I think it's very difficult question because that means the rights of
