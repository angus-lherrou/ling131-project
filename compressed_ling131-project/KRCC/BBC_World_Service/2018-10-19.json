S. midterms approach looking to look at the identity politics have left and right and their impact on democracy\nOn a panel this week in the studio with me here Adrian ... professor of politics the University of Kent\nNine or ... novelist and journalist\nYes among lecture on government at Harvard University and in Cambridge being Bob ... a lecturer in English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nPolitics is I think a ... that has been given and is\nMean by it Priya identity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe claims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with identity of a sudden then with questions of justice we can talk about that a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized so I didn't see individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that saw rocky arguing for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a coma novelty that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities and in countries so there's a problem I think it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than more communal collective response\nYes among you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so no one had what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your loss of privilege as outrageous\nSo is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number\nFeeling that your last ... outrageous though is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing in the abstract things that didn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims Israel oppression exploitation\nBy the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always a painting to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... alliance that\nThat doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering you'll repression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply don't recognize the vets exactly in fact what the tea movement did they said look\nBusiness love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what had sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a wide them how can go and sort of dramatic life story they have no spotless\nUm [laughter] I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of a different race we should celebrate that and it was part of a left but talking about food that was probably ... ... is the crux of a disagreement about what decided we want ... I went to society whether it's more interracial\nBut some afford pickles problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures Robin where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation though I knew the picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably ... I didn't see politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression\nAnd structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't all it takes into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleven for you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an orderly social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us shouldn't be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity\nAnd ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there\nYou're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Adrian\nIt's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all parts and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together somehow to differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out and that should be celebrated\nBut also the commonalities that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think ... then she watches has become\nSo the ... I I really would like example it's I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic a hand wringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get unless black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples of what I Want to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways as an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal not when you look at the numbers are those are true\nThe majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the vacations if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and visits particularly deepen justice but you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually ...\nWhite people got shot by the police as well one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough [noise] people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it\nReligious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society and the and the longer function physical policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing up on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions banking situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center than Tuesday's fight efficient exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWhen it started to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic mono culture self conception of themselves and thank God we've started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that\nThat is something you talked to quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that are addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by age as minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and that means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledge to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver an Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't handle UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost app\n[noise]\nOf the b._b._c.

I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem\nBut I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam\nIs just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's a good politics happens because those tribes are bad but other tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't take it out I think the question is\nThat I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious and ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retain an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domesticated hop wild feast of national innocent to try and claim it forward sales to make it inclusive to say that either hire a collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of level of United States but obviously we fight\nFor inclusion of all the different groups under that common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cause in public and a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nI'm ... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nThe other hand around so badly anxiety saying that you I Love it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to talk what's wrong and loving your country and its people at the end zone accuse people of identity politics but I'm saying your national\nZuma view opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you do your as your your\nOther people of identity politics but I'm saying your national presumably you're opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and your your your um your your national thing making my country but the majority of of Hindu\nMajority of them so I look at nationalism and that's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be the ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respective a nominee\nThat is not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of national lives in the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one hand\nI Would do out of areas of angry as well as the agent if if I can bring you back then in a sense there there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets\nWell because I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan national spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that if everybody identifies primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively and peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course and that you think should between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly\nDo and the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fired for the cause of people who share my identity\nTies that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fired for the cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nThat's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down\nThe Trump Administration is going after employers who hire undocumented workers\nThis country will not survive if we don't ...\nThe way they can come over here and we're\nThe immigrant labor on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News this morning starting at five AM on Ninety One point five\n... your cc local news on Ninety One point five ... or so you see the numbers from twenty six team showed the sector surpass the entire US Economy in the survey is part of a large undertaking by the city forestry department southern Colorado's NPR station this is southern Colorado's\nNPR station K.
