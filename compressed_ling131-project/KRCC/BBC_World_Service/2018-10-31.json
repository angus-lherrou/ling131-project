S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is the panelists immigrant who arrives to seek a new life and through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say and this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created and this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely British allies the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's extreme that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened\nPeople of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the myth of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen from the early twentieth century of large European integration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states has a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who were coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are feeling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there is not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean at theories in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African\nOr a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there haven't even more recent

University in Wales\nWhat we were trying to do is try to take a a really comprehensive look both overtime at across different countries in terms of how does leader and social media impact upon puppet reactions terror events and the reason for doing that really is to try to put out some similarities and differences because there there was some times [noise]\nA slight tendency to just say this is a is a new problem but what we want to do with say actually some evidence of of this problem has deep roots and then there are some things that have been changed by the presence of social media and the ways in which the media environment has changed the last few years\nAs I've been in the case of the Bataclan ... ... people in the venue that night who are sending out at social media posts things people in the area ... what does that say ... what what did you learn from looking at that kind of studying\nOne of the really interesting things about the ... case study but we've seen similar patterns and others as well as you do have\nIndividuals in the same ... to their followers that they are in that and there's all sorts of horrific things Gail that's quite important because\nFrom from a ... point of view what the police it never quite sure of is is this a genuine message or is this someone what are the terrorists inside the venue who has a hold of\nYou will the police it never quite sure of is is this a genuine message or is this someone one of the terrorists inside the venue who has a hold of someone sudden someone's to work out at is deliberately trying to do them for confrontation so you've got to get these very\nVery dynamic situations that increase the pressure of place decision by cars so they could have to decide what are they going to do with all of this was intimation that is coming out in in these kinds of scenes and the Bataclan a case was a particular job with that\nAnd in other cases we see\nExamples of where people are really you're earning for real time information if people buy in the community and the emergency responders for instance the Boston Marathon in ... and that's an interesting case of a mess that we're being protected by the terrorists but also by going through recalls happen the terrorist attack and so\nWhat you see is you see all these different act is kind of coming in to play now and there's a lot of public can political interests of the current time around misinformation disinformation\nAmong other things we would try to do is try and say well actually in in the minutes of terror attack and in the ... and sometimes that days\nIt's really hard to know precisely what is guy because yes you do have genuine contributes to social media who tried to promote public understanding of what happened but you said the people who have tried to agitate the situation trying to mislead and deceitful\nSay what are you having ... you know France responded emergency services and in the media organizations\nWhile I think one of the things that strikes me about having looked across a large number of terror events is\nThere is enormous pressure these situations to get information out there to kind of be the person to break the story to kind of get that kind of skill\nBut actually it's similar when people get it wrong and this does happen quite regularly that people get it wrote that has quite a long term detrimental effects in terms of trusted institutions and trust in in democracy and those kinds of things on these things can be exploited\nSo what kind of saying there are risks to go out to early and there are things that you can do to try and manage those risks so for example rather than just reacting to an event have applied have it ... who are you guys told to who's getting his told things when can you say things\nThat might make tons of it is just trying to avoid the information vacuum\nIt was ... who are you guys told to who's got his told things when can you say things\nAnd that's why it's ... it's just trying to avoid the information vacuum that so often is just filled by ... to ... maybe some harmful malicious messages as well designed to cause disruption\nThat I think one of the key findings rallies by by looking back over an extended period of time we're able to to track how place in governmental responses have changed at all to adapt to to to the new information of our but I Am one of the things that's quite clear is\nIf they say nothing if they do leave that vacuum that other people will come in to make mischief so it's really important\nFor all the place of the government and politicians to be able unclear to say in these kind of moments of emergency crisis what people are very unpredictable you know this is what we can tell you so that you do leave a cat so others can come into the field of misinformation disinformation\nPacked mountain in ... and ... and you read that report what did you make of it\nI think it's really important especially because it it well researched and ... and it is you know it's one of the things this is just sensible\nHere it is clear that this will help because what it does is allows organizations that are responsible in some way for the information flow around these terrible events\nTo sink in advance about how they might respond to have a strategy in place which we can then follow that makes it much less likely that they will just do something automatically or make a mistake because you've formal likely to get your role if you go on your instincts at the time like this\nAnd I think it offers also advice for all of us we don't receive outside of journalists who are taking misinformation that coming out but also anyone who's what access to Facebook Twitter or any other social media which is think carefully about the messages that Europe could find as well you know they're just automatically retreat somebody ... sounds like\nYour friends who wants to know unless you consider yourself be very careful we actually all have a responsibility\nTo take care with information environment around that some\nOf the report does it just gives a really good framework for that\nType ... thank you very much mail he is built
