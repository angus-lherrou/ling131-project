celebrity typical title anymore it seems like a professor remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real truth or those that can be invented\nAnd controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes to mind\nAnd one can only imagine what he thought through social media and the Internet today but crosswords very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare gr attuned Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um the image is as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm and its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think are writing properly and cross mind can be many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to an editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of\nThen it's just pure swell and I think that um the image is as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think are writing ... crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely\nOr one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries manned by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floored pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in the heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and he's a school's off for the illusions two classic works of Jim and the ... and Shakespeare as he said and he was a continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short ... feet often surprising and funny expressions of the truth or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book form several times\nBut he himself was aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism nether coincides with the true it is either a half truth old woman to half truths\nFor their religions to classic works of German detergent and Shakespeare as you said and he also continued the brilliant tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich they should be short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book for several times\nBut he himself was aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism never coincides with the trick it is either a ... year old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one month shows tell me Katrina why was that it's so important to him\nWhen I think I had a really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm\nThe director max Reinhardt who very famous that cross this time or in Germany especially um he developed a day on a mental showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cross he kind of embrace that yeah trick to blend or\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... justice stage for this book and good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crafts than is before the war is someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fell off his\nFriends and so on but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably the other choice some punt the out of circumstance and this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in completely or you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's simply because crosses born into a small bohemian town or\nCan they can simply fool and and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in completely or you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's simply because Kraus was born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in some sense of never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong and I think this is one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements crashed was going to a private money and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that his great love was through the ... not hung up about ... unpaid turn of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south of crossers birthplace in what is now the Czech Republic\nAnd the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nOne first and foremost it had to be secretly relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and a seat in the unit Daniel CD as he called her she inspired cross to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over a thousand letters to hurt you and the court system relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crust he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the nine hundred and twenty two issues of the fact that he didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day and I mean not that a\nHer lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut we know from his letters that he shows have very different kind of personality and in them he's really in love you I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to maybe properly another aristocrat but she's still kept having a relationship with crowds continued to ...\nAfter mentioned to a nine hundred and twenty two issues of ... but didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case I he really sat down and wrote like every other day and I mean not that I heard lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut we know from his letter that he shows have very different kind of personality and in them he's really love the I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to marry properly another aristocrat\nBut she's still kept having a relationship with crowds continued to meet him to travel together and you can really call her one of the most important um women ...\nQuite a few so that he had this low the image isn't true yet actually quite a full of life I think\nAnd incidentally has oh she provided a quiet place to rest and worked for him and she may have inspired some of the grounds his best a lyric perjury here is the end of a poem cooled to wrinkle in you\nTend to well remembered line praying a suit to rest my fault so that this final trace of godly grace may remain mine [noise]\nAnd even the crowd was usually suspicious of new technology an interesting factors that he did by a calm fairly early on in Nineteen fourteen and she was so taken by the pleasures of Dr ... she became one of the first female holders\nOf a driving license in Austria Hungary but the carefree days of muttering across Europe was soon ... by the outbreak for the first World War and how crowds reacting to the war is the subject for the second part of this for him from the BBC will say this will be back in a couple of them [noise]\nHave made it actually possible to become a spectator to one's own self destruction and cross actually write something of this sort in the sort of the forward I actually even prior to the place prologue cross I Would say prefer to be a

clean he just bad of the war and the ... of humanity that exposed as he observes the devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people mean\nOff the horror and probably ... of the war came the dissolution of the Austria Hungarian and planned this happen a hundred years ago in October ... an event of Nineteen Eighteen tell me what was crowned says reaction I mean after all his native country what his great love seed money still resigned it\nIt became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to something Katrina's had early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than\nProbably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy had actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that Kraus as the war was dragging on especially to not only really anticipate the outcome of it was but that eventually he really desire to it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what he saw as wholly immoral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually was the war on subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called the quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually ...\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various\nInstitution that

actually in the stall jak\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so Kraus as sort of again you know in his kind of enlightenment\nUm attack trying to connect the dots are better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess the type of thing they cross embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more tenuous as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye a very keen eye on the reactionary elements of society as they were developing even from early in the Nineteen twenties so specifically the clerical side of Austria\nBut also so called fringe parties on the right for example even the one that Hitler represented and actually it's very interesting that I Believe as early as Nineteen\nTwenty three if not earlier cross was already paying attention to the swastika and already knew who Hitler was and so that's I mean as far as foresight goes are very few who had their finger on the pulse as it were\nAnd we will turn to his view on Hitler in a moment but in the new ... Austria that resulted from the ... during the European ... after the war\nCrimes continue to expose what he saw as greed ... and and the stupidity of his fellow citizens but he did keep an eye on the developments elsewhere to end in Nineteen Twenty one\nHe published what was to become one of his most celebrated articles promotional trips to hell now this was prompted by an advantage in a Swiss newspaper the trips to the battlefields of friends and companies I mean why did he write about this\nThis ... promoted motivating to us as you said that um as one F battlefields pie extending off that meant comes to build riots accompanied by coffee cake to places millions died\nThis kind of battlefield two reasons are as you could call it kind of meat packing all ... of it\nTo hell no this was prompted by an ad version is with newspaper for trips to the battlefields of from a company to tell me why did he ...\nWell is written if men from the ... promoted motoring tools as you said ... as one of the battlefields part X and all that meant comes to build riots accompanied by coffee cake to places where millions died\nThis kind of battlefield tourism or as you could call it kind of meat packing all the cliches of the press that already supported the ball and also conveniently forgetting all kinds of mystifying all the horror and atrocities the suffering that happened in that place\nAnd all that I'm kind of as a tourist package for money [noise] costs already dislike tourism in itself but in this context it was especially horrifying for him in his text and by the way he mostly just sites the ads and uh it was also at text you'd like to read a lot\nWell let's hear crowds himself reading from his own school about trips to hell and you don't need to speak German to hear the barely suppressed rage in his voice cedar\nFair for me for the\nThe you\nKnow when Hitler became chancellor of Germany in early Nineteen thirty three cramps seemed for once lost for words literally in the whole year there was only one very slim edition of ... too but we'll just four pages\nIt contained across his funeral or ration for his friend the architect\nIdols loss and a short poem\nBoats in July Nineteen thirty four cross did publish a three hundred page explanation of why he feels on and\nSo she won't tell me what did he say\nAnswer this question we have to go back to Ninety thirty three years that\nHitler was named German Chancellor in late January Ninety thirty three and drive off the birds in February Ninety thirty three a co started to read it and research and I see a text about the contemporary for him contemporary nuts\nAnd a short time and not in July Nineteen Seventy four crafts did publish a three hundred page explanation of why he felt on and so she don't tell me what did he say\nTo answer this question we have to go back to Ninety thirty three years that\nHitler was named German Chancellor in late January Ninety thirty three and drive off diverts in February Ninety thirty three\nA cow started to ride and research an essay a text about the contemporary for him contemporary Nazi seizure of power in Germany you wrote this takes from Vienna\nAnd he wrote this ah three hundred page essay until a late September Ninety thirty three and to prove they're already dead a printing proves and he even wrote in handwriting corrections on the proof but then I decided against publication and\nWe can't think of free reasons why he did not publish this text that he called the victim of my book is knocked the vote ... not so one reason is that he didn't want to harm the people that he mentioned a in this essay and of course uh\nUh he did not want to get himself into danger because at that time it could have been really dangerous for him to publish it takes like that\nFor example lowered streak a famous philosopher and member of the Vienna Circle at that time both killed at the stairs of the Vienna University by a crazy young Nazi\nAnd ... a more over he thought that his mode of thinking and riding so the answer is mode of thinking and writing was just not appropriate to capture\nThe violence or the unbelievable violence that both going on in Germany in Ninety Seventy three and on the arts\nSo what he did in this issue of the ... in some an ID thirty for that you mentioned\nA bit of both caused about ... a shy and so why did

broadly about sexual violence in Japan and in Georgia how big stigma is it to be a victim of sexual violence in Japan jewelry\nThere is very strong stigma against rape victim here in Japan and even talking about sex it's quite to boo but the thing is if you go out to sit in Tokyo and\nIf you go to convenience store let's say you see these magazines was woman and bikini or naked women and I feel like there are many symbols and pictures and\nWhat you will see a woman being sexually objected but yet talking about sex isn't very open and hearing Japan and in a traditional media like newspaper as

covered was different wars and it's just really hard to know what is actually going on\nTo to enjoy what you what is the situation there when it comes to sexual violence and the stigma around it\nYeah also in Georgia we have a huge stigma about where a parent sexual violence\nBunch sturgeon government to snow during ... something because we have very high statistics of family side in Georgia we have very ... it's kind of very macho culture here I\nMean we cannot these cars openly sexual the rights of women here in Georgia stigma is who was a stigmatized as a very loud D woman which is not

snow storm descends on Omaha as I get to meet the city's full moon democratic man my bully he doesn't agree the current Eastman will lose traditional democratic votes is arguing that has sent these policies no longer on the fringe\nShe's not to the left she's really speaking out to what needs to happen it's it's the logical changed that needs to come from progressive systems of government so\nYou're saying the center of gravity of the Democratic party\nWhy take the center of gravity for the whole country has changed because\nThere are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical or the history of our Democratic Party has been progressive always has I mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid\nThis is just the next logical step I think it's progress on your support on the number ...\n... and you must buy you a couple more questions\nGravity for the whole country has changed because\nThere are people now who have no medical care where that one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through health care\nSo this is nothing radical uh the history of our Democratic Party has been progress and always has I mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid\nThis is just the next logical step I think it's progress for a number ...\n... and you might if I asked you a couple more questions\nAre awry as young they can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old man of the Republican Party how do the full term congressman and to to the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house seats here as a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting over the next two years\nSeems to me that if done making the Republican nominee wins here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female rural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately to the right to\nDo with race at all as I Am at this point in time or\nOn the doorstep congressman seems to be winning hearts minds ... votes but would it be enough for victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fan to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to net Dona ...\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement\nBased on current political standings and maybe I should say I hope for is is I Believe [noise]\nHope rather than belief that the Democratic votes when I spoke to ... morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Harold she told me that this race is shaping up to be the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen at the moment she said the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nRaise one point two five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had the four and she got a lot of money from you\nPolitical standings and maybe I should say I hope for is I Believe\n... rather than belief and with the Democratic votes alone you know I spoke to Rosen morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Herald she told me that this race is shaping up to be the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen or the mom and she said the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEven raise one point two five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had before um she got a lot of money from\nIndividuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever um and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head and progressive movement\nAnd does that mean but this race and this one district does as we heard there from the former mayor become this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYet so the um progressive groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones of this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs it something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top and the Democratic party or is it simply a a national picture\nSo the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more up opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get huge turnout so I'm not going to be key to this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but will not necessarily translate into votes\nSo that's a good question so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and the hurt and she didn't want to\nAnd so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get huge turnout and that's going to be key to this so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily translate into votes\nSo that's a good question so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give\nVoter that Democrats in Nebraska should get voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown and previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking the hurt and she's been a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the vote\nAnd you don't see many I've had a dumb bacon there with his sizzling bacon I have a very ... you say it on the TV every coughing up but you don't see her\nShe she does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might see more ads from her because she got that one point five million on but she also has spent a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path they take\nTime what about the Trump five to how does how does he play into this race and the state so\nTrump um came here and spoke and they can smoke on stage with him on right now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republican mad about how Democrats handled it and\nOne thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican winning is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the these other women say that we are [noise]\nThat was Roseanne morning or from the ... will Herald Jamie you clearly dumb the defining piece on midterms out of a mountain
