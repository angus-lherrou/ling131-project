that is a part of the current tradition a of of of of western liberalism\nThat's not really the issue that we're facing now have or it's a matter of whether the values that we profess actually have any reflection in what's happening in the United states one of the things that was so disturbing\nAbout the cabin I hearing is just watching um the institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with\nPot politics with an empire shell impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge\nSo those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society are willing to strike at this point over the direction that the country is going and\nRight and it's interesting to

today\nAnd I get the same so but you know just from this conversation from your writing student you are angry euro angry about the way America works and and your view of of water use a patriarchal society because the ... groups including women and minorities is something that makes you angry but to change it you have\nTo you have to reach out beyond your own groups whether it be women or whether it be African Americans you know to build a winning coalition\nYou're going to go national and you've got to originally you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities so how do you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nWell so I guess to roll back for a moment and just in just that you know as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection allergy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are\nA stated values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill\nLed to the elevation of Clarence Thomas ah over in as against the uh claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminism sound and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment and very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely step forward by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism and feminine\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looked as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black ... I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says\nI find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist rude it's time to hold back into survival mode\nDue to the dumpster fire on live by a boring feminist agenda\nAnd\nI mean I was laying people who actually\nUh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nIs exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr blazing Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same\nTime I don't mind described as a problem I get I get the industry\nYou know the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common called him I can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm I'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach\nCan make a very big difference I get that I guess what I'm\nI'm moving toward is asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be more than a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we call them groups or\nMany of us are I I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that\nThe civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so am I challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that women things ingest that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nMay be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president they how do you feel about Morocco Bible because he's with the midterms coming up as we get into the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and algae beat the Americans that as well known since I said I go\nVotes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to listen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather killing off he he didn't do enough to act\nIn retrospect Brock Obama actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on a on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nI had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but then excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of difference um within a broader reality\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American\nPolitics and just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season with the Democrats are trying to create a

bad is it really on these concerns I have a data just an occupational hazard of life on line or something to eat but\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat is very small founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications and information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the ... says to the molten Web created back in the seventies he believes the more than the Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nCreated back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure that grows ... is a regional design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data and in particular data about you\nI mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth and the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily\nPanic about assault someone else's harvesting that data particularly of getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nThey may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone so what\nIs the ... it was this architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period you haven't got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants that our government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Tim burners Lee has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have is\nThe most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of ... being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property in negotiations all the time but I\nWe don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further

information warfare fake news ... Anderson is the founder of scout hey oh it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the boats on them and ... the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by bought\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally the\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that those kind of could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people for it\nTend to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook of these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show\nIs told in the living dead might be another movie but I I just [noise] people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator out there having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably cause us to talking to each other or at least they sing them\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be\nAnd the retreat them they'll use their messaging to promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right to that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media because you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it hasn't yet not yet Barry Bonds and who suggests the variety of own says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nOne of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity um with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is ...\nCreates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those no they're connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized attack has no children and I do see\nCentralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different note and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social kind of social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic so this is going to be that we have a way through because ultimately we've all got to live with the Internet is not going to go away on invented can me\nI'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we'd outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I Am absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic beret and dissident who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly it's not\nJust technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation and legal changes it's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's going to take\nMole\nYou
