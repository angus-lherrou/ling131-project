even argue that it's impossible to define\nThough I suspect that my three guests today we'll try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joe ... a cultural historian a chilling

cool and her two thousand and sixteen book the birth of cool style narratives of the African diaspora\nWelcome to all three of you and just start with I Want to ask each of you in time if you could just pick one example of who award it's a perfect example of cool for you personally and why Joe\nI don't like to choose an epitome of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Muhammad Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them do some name and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that call had to change into something more confrontational\nAnd Ali although universally admired now I'm most white Americans hated Ali when he took them do some name and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change into something more confrontational\nIs in the [noise] most [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSocks off in us Lester Young speaking not long before he died on a recording that features and the forthcoming film president of beauty direction by Henry fettuccine so we've lost a young embrace cool\nInfluence other jobs musicians including the next generation people like the trumpeter Miles Davis he's music ... at the beginning of the program Carol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\nWell Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how he changed jazz music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home to sit with much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd his men um jacket and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy clothes from shops\nOn university campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise]\nSo it's very unusual he was Nineteen fifty five\nEasy nine I'm Serious look a jacket beautiful pastel colored quite close to cap a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling he's talking directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black therefore I Am deal with it he's\nPlaying with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style or young white men are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like\nWhy wasn't this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what what\nUh no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling he's talking directly into the camera offend me he's saying I'm black that far I Am deal with it\nHe's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style or young white men are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself ex athletes not just for one group can be for me I'm like why was\nThat his emphasis on style on the one that's looking good visual pose what we're talking about public tickets hat but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family or how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties they will still British colonial subjects posed was important to them [noise]\nTo stress this idea of visibility a sense of pride\nMaking a life to themselves and Britain despite all in spite of the racism to pull up our system that was rising and Britain the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties so there was this\nContinuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nUp to this point we defined coolest largely an African American concept something that was developed by jazz musicians as a result of being on the outside not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of coup was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one ... one time on\nHauling Jimmy Johnson all accounts and all of them were\nShe walks in a mine\nHumphrey bake 'em as Rick plane and duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael conscious and clearly this was a new type of crude which ... to ... to the Hollywood movie audience but then you ... what was known as film wrong how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell filmed while protecting a star disillusioned I'm cynical\nAll in June and joined us and all the towns and all the world who\nWalks in a mine\nHumphrey by as Rick Blaine unduly will send us some in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael coaches including this was a new type of crew which ... the concept the Hollywood movie audience with the new ... what was known as filmed well how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical loners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow when water world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why don't you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is so resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface uh America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a ... way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film and the war was not this was a genre that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nI'm Joel you said that the cool appeal that this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front of ... century explosives as like al ... and ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence a Albert camera writes a book called the rebel a study of mad and revolt in Nineteen fifty one and it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nTo some and disillusionment and Joe you said that the cool appeal let's assume law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh but ... ... ... can you briefly explain why in a way\nThat is a wonderful historical concurrence\nOr Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of mad and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool is he says that I rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model\nFor fighting society fighting a more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about jobs have been talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society and different countries [noise]\nThe thing that strikes me is that all these icons of coup seem to be men where the women can women be cool to Carol\nYes they can I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in aspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of my identity and that means for them\nOkay set us or a female coup like Conan giants crew there what about in film to ah [noise] I don't know why are women were often cooler than men\nTo me as cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in all aspects of their lives and uses clues and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of my identity and and what that means for them\nOkay set us or a female could I come in jazz today what about in film to ah\n[noise] ah in film you know why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film noir Tom fatalities depicted as dangerous evil ... seemed mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the weather that the icons of cool seem to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians or film or actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThat tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to his cool in a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban sonic youth from the eighties or nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associate with them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nNewest rebel persona I specially and music for example are all women and so to some extent effect concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell I guess whatever we nothing because no one male as I say it did help cement the idea of the rebel as cool agree with you this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen listen to it I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who quite different from the Nineteen forties film law here is of Humphrey Bogart and Robert ...\n[noise] yes in movies\nWell I guess whatever we often 'cause no one may lives I say it did help cement the idea of the rebel as who agree with you this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen wasn't it I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who quite different from the Nineteen forties filmed while heroes of Humphrey Bogart and robot ...\n[noise] yes in movies Marlon Brando James Dean and also Montgomery cleft made rebellion attractive their style is disaffected a sensitive vulnerable and even plagued with self styled\nJames Dean was easy for why teenagers to identify with he became a superstar a legendary I kind of cool when he died in a car crash at age twenty four after having made just three films only one of which had been released east to beat and\nThe other two are rebel without a cause and giant were released after his death\nHis disaffected attitudes struck a chord with young people worldwide\nWho saw on him their own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded adults\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous as soon as the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings in the Senate people were persecuted for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any were at extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified wholeheartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\nLet's hear from the Nineteen fifty five film rebel without a cause with James Dean as the archetype of teenagers struggling with his parents\nWe give you love and affection don't really old and one is it was it because we wanted to that party\nYou know what kind of drunken brawl kind of artist turn into starting place for kids\nTo go you say you didn't care if they drink\nSaid mental [noise]\n\nYou know you'll say why do they have\nTo have you know he takes us\nDr cools with James Dean as the archetype teenager struggling with his parents\nWeekend they love and affection don't we pulled in what is it was it because we wanted to that body\nWell you know what kind of drunken brawl those kind of are these turn into starting place for\nKids to go you say you didn't care if they drink\nSaid mental [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you know you'll say why do they have to\nWait a minute hey you know he takes after\nJames Dean Jim Baucus I'm doren I'm Virginia Bruce sock in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas Ray of code and this was a film that speak for an entire generation of young Americans as he said but it's also point had these with the new teenagers very much opposed fulfillment on\nYes in fact we're teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\n... that these films the fashion came to be seen as crucial to didn't as well as the actors\nOf color yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the teacher to white T shirt nice everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of a a naval uniform and around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean in rebel without a cause this\nGleaming white ... red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nSo the classic of course his ... his everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of the nasal unit farming around nineteenth teen but seeing on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire then ... by James Dean\nAnd rebel without a cause this dreaming like ... red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with the a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nOne of the other major she gets from his parents we mustn't forget about it that the rebels spirit was a singer Elvis Presley\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nJoe so what did Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool well Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worshipped Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away\nAnd when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando it's kind of a shock looking back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is there is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on the African tradition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage\nAnd he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do with the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean into Elvis Presley\nYou could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American beers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on the Afghan or contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impacts of people like James Dean into Elvis Presley on popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted to such an idea of crude across the landscape but I Wonder what you will think Kobe really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe\nNo it's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named were I kinds we actually considered cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed to capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nCould you once you if you will the American concept is cool inspired young people around the world this isn't punch because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nThat cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescents internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes and for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty\nFilms permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebel style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere is I found that the ... post colonial rebels um the French films lot hand from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much here costs of it's in which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out\nHow to respond to police violence who bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and vans is Jewish one of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of cruise cultural imperialism [noise]\nFor me not just about the kind of a topping down if you live but it was that what Claudia angel Libyan saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in a particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground the way one side of the coolest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing coup hasn't remains static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that crew which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream of conformity that we've been talking about so it was cool today there's conformity\nSir I'm

Marcus Garvey about two missile Mandela Rosa Parks and they became my mentor that I never meant to talk to him oh the ...\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf go and they started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was a clinic that inspired that focus on what to\nWe used to tell people we went up on these things in our clinic\nTo people get caught up some people get paid for it to protect civilian guys what do we do\nSomeone at the committee had a suggestion but I'd be a kid like you know what\nOf the ridge and fight on the guy on\n[laughter] ... [laughter]\nI don't know\nWhere the topic will be clean no see which\nWhen it's dropping you see that one is ...\nAnd I'm like wow\nThis is a good idea to do we just don't believe in somebody to commuted we just sat there and they were like wow I never let me think about it but let's get the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way and that's where Kenny experience in states us in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people that's why we have I think you do to them because we now have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes at first it started cutting you'll pipes yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will really be or not to be a wife or their children\nTo be the ones that they want to you know a kiosk so I'll give them income that's why we're able to survive\nThan they are really out so well by that is that some times that they can\nKibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you were ever to people who need it to survive in them recording surviving now have you had any interaction with them yes admitting that they started cutting the pipes at Fox they started cutting you'll pipes yes\nSo that was really terrible so what I did for several of them would really be Oh nice\nTo be a wife or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was in combat with somebody then there's a daily out so well by that is that some times that they found their water we don't stand mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that that they have the water there this is\nKenny old over he hasn't run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWe set for two shootings and they said for ten\nSo you will to clean my audience clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about ... cents yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to walk with them for the week without too you know within the system [noise] so that's your what's your ...\n[noise]\n\n\nJust listening to Kenny how his life story the some makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nSolution here and we say are always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he's street smart he's slums more if you like he knows how to operate the\nI don't want to paint shelf go as a one man band you know Kenny just off on his own doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for all that was because they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit less stores a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that ...\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations of a similar size or everything's being signed off by the board so preparing for that you know quite\nThat does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for all that was that they do that very well rewarded\nHe makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think he's now a bit less still is a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that to shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with over ... of a similar size or everything's being signed off by the board so okay in for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment well they bring in a lot of money shelf co just wanted to million dollar prize\nFrom the Hilton foundation the hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the work that shelf go does not just the water but there are other projects to buy the only ones who are trying to solve this problem shelf that not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people I Know when I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a will to into slums and\nJust in Kibera I you know the ... ... email said and I'm thinking one woman she's in one of the woman was ... she was saying gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping water out right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on cops so they just ... up and passing it out so they get the water the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut as several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes maybe the will to will be held legally during the day time but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... different players involved as you said it's how does shelf co fits into the\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that they both whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was was with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in the slum itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet of foot because you know fast doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by keep errands for Barron's\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem\nUltimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in Islam itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to circle you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by ...\nThey didn't wanna hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible mentors\nMandela mountain that I ... I'll be Rosa Parks basis how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nMen and women who don't just\nSit down and watch when Prince William what's happening\nAnd what they did they organized people to transform their own life they didn't sit down and which plants and now that's a puzzle begins before that\n\n[noise]\nThank you censor that recording and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can cheat in again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from another part of the planet [noise]\nAnd if you suddenly

we've not go to a stage yet where we can change that\nSo I think that this bizarre power relationship with an academic science\nSuch and he makes these kind of beliefs and ideologies a bit stronger than in other professions don't suggest\nWaded imperial college here in London where women are pushing back Keli Ramirez is this soil microbial ecologists and cofounder of five hundred women

have signed up to Ames, Iowa ... what a group objectives originally political\nIt's not political it is about creating equity in the sciences it's about all of the collective inequities that women face and that can be from having someone tell you you're a girl so you're not any good at math or are you sure you should be in this class are smart enough to be here\nAnd that comes pretty early on through high school and maybe in your early college years once you get into grad school not only are people questioning whether or not you should be there and your intelligence at if your degree has been good enough\nBut then they start to question your leadership skills and whether you can be in charge of students or projects as you move farther into your career there\nPaid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting to support front and signatures as a ... we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges\nIt is an open letter that we wrote as the women in science asking scientists women and supportive of women scientists to stand together and change the face of science as it is today\nWe have signatures on the pledge from over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed our pledge\nAnd what do you hope to take this we have\nTo be a fully funded sustainable organization that continue to push\nTo make science open and quizzes and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do if five hundred women scientists within America are succeeding than we want to make a five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline that are profiting from this the right we can keep moving up and up\nKelly Ramirez or what\nFrom over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed a pledge\nAnd what do you hope to take this we have\nTo be fully funded sustainable organization that continued to push\nTo make science open and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do at five hundred women scientists within America are succeeding that we want to make five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline that are pressing for Mr Right we can keep moving up and up\nKelly Ramirez than what Kelly and don't you just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia\nBut women those are just not as visible last week professor donor strict and became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics a day later another one front says on old won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd despite professor strict in historic achievement her biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on\nRebecca hey get is a ... in history of science at the University of Kent she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nAbout how science developed and how it to find a space within the culture and within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy it was it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of all ... wasn't necessarily particularly well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to me it's all to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own oath or say\nI'm One of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or a less intelligent because of the way that gender roles\nHave being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded where they may once the hatch\nAnd don't pay anything because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the lens more authority absolutely and particularly when she got to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public face so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a masculine kind of around ... it's going on and on owning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments and we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um\nBeing excluded why they may wants to ...\nI don't think it's because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the ... more authority lately and particularly once you get to science being seeing it's something that's relevant in the public face so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a mass scale and kind of ... ... it's going out and earning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments and we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a uh Korea policy can fall I say a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish in\nAnd a roots by what she can expect to end and the thing so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite late tone\nAnd by that point ... women are very much being excluded from those of cheating and historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places that that happens so the role of searching granted she's one of those places where you might living by doing scientific walk\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you know finding people doing scientific research within you invest states for example so yeah it's really only make sure on that you get\nThe kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that if someone that she paid to do ... particular problem it's just pretty much across the\nWill to the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe I'm ... I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America although interestingly there are more opportunities for women in what is a very new in the ... system in\nSay the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach a strong to be in the women's college so what was that in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings all women I mean partly open it sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places to see the thing is\nPull Murray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach astronomy in women's college so I was in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings a women I mean partly often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there in a way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to opt for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places\nSeem to think he said that when a field is new and it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I could make it interesting that in when you look at the desk of figures\nOn women in science for example there's some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose kind of at your worst of the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love to know more by the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing research or are we talking about invested systems\nWith what is the kind of funding that goes into research within universities and the different countries so in some cases\nI suspect that may be longer if I could sum of women being in higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded\nAnd way there are places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find\nWomen finding an opportunity because men are not taking the option to get there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so a new kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own\nFollowing the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of established individuals usually male who publishing in those areas and some interesting they we sometimes find that that gets women an opportunity until then off and just start pay that then pushed out so far a\nTypical an iconic example of basses computer programming which early on was very much seen as a female role we sort of associated with lots of ... old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In a very

any human being what is happening to the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking under extremely dangerous conditions because budgets\nIn the studio a WWF for his saying who's been a leading this research welcome to the program tell us a bit more about those conditions I mean they're pretty boy for we're talking sometimes range is not even having ... boots\nRight imagine if you are living in a very remote location away from your family's you don't have access to clean drinking water you don't have access to clean toilets which are the basic needs of any human being what is happening the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking under extremely dangerous conditions because porches on on protests are stealing these animals from the forest and also they are going to the\nMental stress ranges have to stay away from their families and we have done a study on their mental stress and it's it's it's very shocking said what what what's the situation is that ranges of walking under extremely difficult dangerous conditions Wade noted combination\nIsn't it the case that you know by not having the equipment they need and as you say suffering high rates of illness because of wherever working I mean that's ... ... but it's going to make anybody not want to go the extra Marlin doing their job particularly if a job as a dangerous one\nSeriously and the ... but it was quite surprising when we did the subway saw several years the largest ever study done on ranges and we've looked like surprised when the rangers said they really want they're they're really proud of their walk they love what they'd be but at the same time we have to make sure\nThat if you really want them to continue doing this work then we have to support them be have to give them equipment for example the basic boots\nHalf of them don't even have boots and they end up spending their own money for buying boots and uniform when every drained your salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in in a McDonald's\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the rangers or is being all knocks it is but where's it going on ...\nSo we have to look at three\nThree levels of solution number one is the rangers or the government employees to see maybe we need to look into the policies that are beside the recruitment of ranges training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those that are formed sneak to come to the challenge we had\nBut I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the ranges a it is being on drugs but where's it going I think\n... so we have to look at three\nThree levels of solution number one is the rangers or the government employees so that you may be neat to look into the policies that are beside the recruitment of ranges training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those reforms needs to come to the challenge we had it all yeah we didn't have the quantifiable data that we can speak to the politicians ... and really bad shape change your policies now we have that information so that has to be done all kinds of Asian groups and\nI'm interested people need to come together to address the policy and number two is all the conviction group also need to invest more resources and the basic needs for example a piece of study clearly shows\nThat are the sites where it and use a supporting contribution groups supporting rangers rangers have better access to clean drinking water so maybe we need to\nInvest more into the basic needs of ranges and number three which is equally important is to create away in this above range is how do we make anybody in Asia and Africa do you have the feeling young young generation the school to be an end to it is the coolest job\nJust one very very quick point there I mean how confident are you about is going to happen I mean one of the stuffing statistics is that sixty percent of those you serve age would worry about the safety if they reported corruption that's pretty troubling as an Eighteen it is and and that's why we have to uh walk\nWith the national governments and to add to address these issues I think corruption is definitely one of the issue that has been raised by ranges but data bigger issues which needs to be addressed like a health and safety\nAnd the training and they ... I'm I'm pretty positive because the first time we have a quantifiable information we can go in law me the government had this information\nFrom many thanks for coming in ...

I was just I I'm Sorry I shouldn't\nI shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are the examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to um talk about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that philosophy\nA it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities young\nPeople that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is that's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it\nWhat if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back that's the name of the game isn't it\nIt's a short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me ...\nRepublicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four was only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant\nIn this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people and that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that version of themselves\nBeginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nYou know remember I had all sorts of coffee out there that I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he if it's if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThen all bets are off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if the country stays on the track that it's on right now the economy running flat out the accelerator\nDown unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I\nDon't know who can I remember the um period of the Nineteen nineties when we had the sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIn the process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter what the other side does and that\nThe American ...
