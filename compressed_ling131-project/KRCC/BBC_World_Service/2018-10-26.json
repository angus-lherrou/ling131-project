of progress on the road to stability\nBut the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operate with impunity in waves of territory the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guest is president ... recently appointed national security advisor having to do a lot more he formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat\nWith little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country well I'm dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to talk ... good to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections work cloud with so many Afghans are facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and lack of government control of key parts of your territory\nLike Bruce Lee ... everything that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that in came out to vote I think that speaks for itself\nOn what the African people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end is F a I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't\nHere let's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but he is the reality of your own electoral commission\nSaid that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar\nOne of the policeman who survived afterwards said look we fight for our country but we do not get the benefits and respect that I gave them even to Afghan soldiers we suffered so many casualties so many policemen were killed\nBut the government paid no attention to us he said we haven't even been paid yet what does that say about your own government\nAs a national security adviser that is exactly what is on Monday to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges\nBecause I knew was one of the reasons I accepted and took this job it hurt me personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint\nAnd I'm dedicated me and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nBy a issued a statement to our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of service that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful law mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people are in the way in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the need to exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan\nHave been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life and know gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing\nOf course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nice enforces off from your own Afghan forces unfold watch\nBecause this is you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you an annual viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see through TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially\nI'm a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste your way out our war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a ... it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping in equipping training our security right is\nTo provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to ... you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states\n... a pivot thing to ... you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece about action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military a privatized contract to enforce\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nEnvoys ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where well\nI'm going to tell you in your car here because we have on you or I don't think it'll take me straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote fills that\nI had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... ...\nThese are meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one consideration for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report that just because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador\nYou didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip you didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it\nJust strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the

serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of

needs to be felt that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of best a fairly clear on because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it

the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about a thing that Mrs you none of the things that we didn't like and he was saying was she gotta be kidding\nSo what we're in the middle of a negotiation how much they says brinkmanship how much that is both sides kind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions of the two policies\nI think some of it as brinkmanship I didn't think that he feels like compromising very much cause that things will hang on a minute you know the people who votes to leave it you'll mess\nYou clear it up and clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions an apology so I guess what's going to happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've

I Believe it's pronounced\nSo this is a kind of tweak on an existing antibiotics so it takes an existing plow fence politics and it puts on an additional components which ... which bacteria will tighten cite them\nSo it's been described as a Trojan Horse which is\nA bit simple but it's probably quite helpful bacteria have a wolf which protects them but it's not just to start it will take things in and out and bacteria very good at figuring things out over the wall if they don't like it including antibiotics but when a factor in people and does it mean response trying to get rid of that\nIt takes things in and out and bacteria very good at figuring things out over the wall if they didn't like it including antibiotics but when a bacteria in people and there's an immune response trying to get rid of that infection there's a tussle for on to the body tries to keep on bacteria one time\nAnd they have special molecules to bring on it and say well this antibiotic has done is to\nOne of these molecules so the bacteria take the answer politicking at times of stress and get it inside the bacteria and so\nIn doing that it becomes a lot of the natural resistance that bacteria have to some other into politics and that being human trials some yeah so that so that they took away a saint published today we heard about a few months ago but it's encouraging phase two dates and we have these antibiotics that go through three phases before their proof and so this is the end of the second phase of development\nAnd this was a trial in adults with urine infection complicated ear infections that people getting admitted to hospital with kidney infection a bladder infection needing intravenous antibiotics and they were given either their sense of Baltic or a most standard antibiotic and um\nThey did at least is what if not better with this new and it's possible she's very encouraging but it's not we still need more data is just one type of infection\nSaid antibiotic itself could be a more effective but what about that problem than identified the use and misuse of antibiotics I'm making resistance develops become\nSo there I mean it's a very complicated issue and there are lots of different types of different things that needs to be done\nBut to get three examples than one way of reducing the amount of activists who uses by preventing infection with vaccinations if you get your flu vaccine this winter your chances of getting a foreign infection go down but then on top of that if you put a bacterial infection you antibiotics so vaccination can help us in that way\nAnd and it is also helpful to get rid of the expectation for people that they should have on the perfect so when you go to a doctor feeding 'em well having an expectation of antibiotics leads to increased prescribing\nAnd then I thought he was a whole ...
