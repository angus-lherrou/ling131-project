correspondent courage for about ...\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out one of which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat are the search and rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they've found\nDebris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they've also sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well it's kind\nOf what they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meat is into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that heath analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I have to add but what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed with the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for

this hour of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepping bought it the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the L.

Q. community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidents\nRation for the dictatorship his comments against the ... community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were polling remarks\nProbably from an

like this are transformed into public policy and I will do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really wanted better economy from Brazil and

globally assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years that's plastic the huge one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine beauty the tourist dollars\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic someplace at home much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I spoke to him in some ... vice president of the Seychelles we'd have the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we have an ... two thousand tons of waste and exciting and do this is plastic waste so you appreciate the manager of the problem\nWe consume plastic but we did not produce any and yet we have such a large amount of glassy we also received a large amount of ethics as marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that either fixing a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they own a coat refund race is unacceptable for the health and the Cleveland ... reefs and beaches in line with us to stick it image\nOr looking at one recent report from the ... news agency saying that a vote on ... picked up one point two tons of debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island um is this the sort of thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on for their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing towards women they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and you as a mirror of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S are very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect to\nA beach or all sees our water from the ethics so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nTo support or the government is doing to read a country of the things that we ... ourselves for just about that all end up on our beaches\nSo

swimming Ellen MacArthur and thanks for being with us on well long days\nYou know the oceans very well it plastic has become an issue only really in the recent you were you aware of this

world what you have on the bodies all you have you have really finite resources and I very quickly trying to translate that to a global economy when I finished my second round the world and realize that in effect was no different and\nMy interest in plastics come from my interest in how the economy functions how we use materials within our economy and cut the packaging is incredibly high volume thirty like value at the material and a huge amount of it leaks out in the ocean so it was a very different route\nThen Israel foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce up\nWith a goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a secular economy which is an economic model which difference to my current current is very lenient tighten might disposed we take them into the ground who make something out of it and then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example\nWithin a secular economy you turn a straight line and you turn it into a circle so you design the economy so that waste is effectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generating natural systems that what we're doing around plastic packaging\nMembers those three areas it's about being regenerative restore to if it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it by innovating around the packaging that we do so that it's one hundred percent recyclable combustible or a usable\nAnd then the third area is to circulate that material once it's been designed to fit within the system and we have over two hundred and fifty signatures that we've collected for global commitment which we don't here today\nIn Bali around shifting towards that model by twenty twenty five\n[noise] intentions are great it's the enforcement that's going to be pursuing isn't it that's not going to be using\nI intentions all great but I think intentions are important in the right direction and I think one thing that's been missing from the sector is everybody innovation ing innovating sorry and the right direction what we've done is we've we've put together a specific\nSet of targets together with the organizations the government the city's the regions and also some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPlastic packaging world by
