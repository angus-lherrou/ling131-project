World Service in the United states has made possible\nBy American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio content a pie and American public media with support\nLet's think airplanes because a lot of plastic inside the cabins airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind also and takes resources to make that metal just like a dust plastic and takes energy\nAnd it's heavier says the consequences that may cause the airplane thing get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around the metal knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one they're doing the wrong thing or they\nAll I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right\nThe board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhile it's not out tried it it it's just in the European Union in Chile that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throwing it in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that there was single use plastics and a glass bottle you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as the one to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many a return of a bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years well there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not that single use plastics should be used\nIt's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nJust curious as to what the alternative to sweeping is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastic\nSweeping I'm just curious as to what the alternative to sweeping is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban the single use plastic seats in August ... doesn't does it a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures be expanded so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well as\nIn the European Union they're certainly not good for the world\nI Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right and what's really life in your plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature however one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative\nThat's the problem right then you decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why ... ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man they added ... ... people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic I missed the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk my 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single used plastics probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] pizza mogul Ritchie who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that ...\n[laughter] I understand what he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternative but I Do think that environmental degradation on climate change that we see in the world today is such\nA pressing issue and we need sweeping 'em urging action scale on this and of course looking at stake is not new\nAnd we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda can yeah\nAnd of course looking at plastic is not new and we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco\nAnd of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags and I think it's a very welcome development my slights um reservation is around the bottom plastic strollers in particular\nAnd I've been reading the concerns from the splits he writes ... campaign has about this and who talk about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws\nUm in order to be able to drink liquids and use metal ones or pay well I well actually other materials that just paper on mental a glass of silicon don't necessarily what so many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury\nAnd that can be choking hazards metal for example is not safe for hot liquids\nAnd paper said dissolves with repeat to use\n'em so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development\nAnd I'd also like to look not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic and in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of them are on the beaches from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew oh this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is won't stop boils down to the Peter Morici interview that people should be free to pollute the environment if they want [noise]\n... well ... and I guess every time we come from the supermarket Laden with a huge part of plastic packaging we're making our contribution to that so I think for those of us who are extremely concerned about these huge she very refreshing to hear\nA political liberal politicians an on any political views in Europe taking strong action on this um but that seems sort of a groundbreaking ... will cry yeah it is it's it's a directive at this age is ... ... lure of course but hopefully it will lead to legislation which will force\nIndustry to change on but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across each her bricks\nUsing incredible innovation that's being used plastic both yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of south\nIf you've come across ... brakes these incredible innovation that's being used plastic both ... yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia or essentially you take a plastic ball for all of them for being in a way you fill it up\nVery you you you you pack it very densely with all the pieces of plastic a waste that you would normally have just shots in the band and gradually you get a very solid\nPiece of building material it if you can get it to the right place can be used to create a structure that's going to stand there for a thousand years so that's like saying we need to do a feature on [laughter]\nYeah that's an idea that's a that's an idea but but yeah I mean it's a way to sequester the plastic take it out of the environment without even having to recycle it\nYou're listening to the weekend from the BBC will services Scott coming

I. average don't shy away you know I've I've noted my by my has raised sitting it became one can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to address that question [laughter] I thought it was to route\n[laughter] well I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came up by reading from a sitting up in a pub after a conference will come to the system was talking with a group of colleagues say what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why why repeal this effort into creating\nA ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ...\nIt was kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly already by one in ... I Want to explore more are we not worried about one six robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that that as we mentioned already designed by men Forman says Gen did straight man what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around\nAs we mentioned already designed by men Forman says Gen did straight men what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around agency consent and rights\nAnd and also a link to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography that particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put forward and pornography as well\nAnd I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept Gail ideas ...\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight wow male ... sat top or any\nOf my last word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured in this case and it's it's a mine and a woman and it's it's um sex novels me to sort of China [noise]\nUm I think that that's not his problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and they all tend to be white as well um where they aren't where there there are it's all the different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is probably my take on and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things\nJust to check out our we act the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate opposed ... not ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots word so the problem is how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's quite a big ... and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nBut we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly that also official intelligence as hyper realistic ... I mean\nThe ... released a robot can talk to you convincing absolutely so they these are they're not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] and then throw\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can carry around ... app on your phone or tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend in your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic convincing human than any rowboat what's\nBeing reception for your book case so sorry to interrupt quick point I was going to\nSay just hearing you came makes me wonder why people need but she'll go friends and whether it is is this does it say something about your boyfriends and girlfriends don't let me let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a girlfriend\nThe weather is is this does it say something about what we call they got boyfriends and girlfriends ... ... I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a girlfriend is that we're talking about and does it say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and toll free\nNumber ... yeah I think that's there's probably about it and I think it does ... sort of the talks looking at the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we're able to go out there and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems without trade\nGerman author of ... many times for coming on the program big thanks to August ...

I had this pot\nAppears to me that the devices all know the devices seized and from that translate it into something meaningful\nSo it's a bit like CSI where you have the washing machine you take it back to you alive you're wearing a white covered everything of course it's completely ... everyone is incredibly attractive him up and then you've got like a computer that some of the list of ... and then somebody presses a button on a big green light flashes saying is that if you served it must be definitely like that\nA sad thing that I Know what ... some fortune at age just delayed of computer geeks and ... that we ... that are trying the washing machine again and again with different cycles and try and get with the fire and\nTry and the fighting connects to the like why that the washing machine was on trying to find a wife from that device you know and why\nAnd each time just looking at a day that was still hold\nThe data itself comes out in binary format and from there it's just a manual case of going three and physically ... patents what\nWas the outcome of this investigation around the washing machine\nSay we're able to say that the fighting was east and I was on site and that helped to show you that the suspect was indeed involved in the instant\nSo the suicide of this is the ... investigative confuses on this is forensics in our children and what do I guess be quite typical of the many investigations in what you're going to vote\nYes a lot of the investigations are they called in awe department as well as the more they spike devices say something unusual all I really tricky binary for ... they haven't seen before and they're looking for that ... such the guy who's three and try and translates into something that can ease\nBinary for ... they haven't seen before and they're looking for that ... such a three and try and translate that into something they can ease\nGiven the so much crime and you know digital crime scams especially a global in the future what role can you as digital forensics experts play and hoping to get some ... some of these scams for instance\nThat can be really varied depending on the nature of the devices involved but usually if we've got a device say the victims device you can find quite a lot of information about the day so that was received\nFor example when people are on Facebook you can see a lot about the people have message she have a what they said\nIt might not be able to get it all back you can get a really good indication of what happened and it's about making people aware that even if you haven't got the device was sent from just a little you can get from the other device\nSo be warned about Sarah Morris so going to want to do a lot of all was telling me especially the gigs and for these things that reminds me of because of ... how\nHot is it a while if this is a form of attacking in this case hacking forgets to attract criminals and so on who are always really struck a ... in many ways about these digital trials that ... leave and we use washing machine now are you ...\nIt is is it traces of our lives that left everywhere and on the Internet to things things that anymore which is where this small washing machine go this suspect but also even about science GPS tracking when we use our credit cards you know\nAnd what we're talking really about is actually happening nation\nWhich she can cost out of the anyone's life and see what they've been doing ... and also who they may have to match where they ... they were doing with a bean who they were with a slightly ... but I think you know I think I actually I think not to recognition was one of his novels in two thousand and three for ...\nBut it's all coming true in a sense yeah that that ... to spreading the nets out to be able to see you have a way you met says a wedding which obviously in this case is brilliant because it's catching criminals\nBut of course we know this could be equally used I'm against any of us or are in the wrong way and the wrong people can get caught up in ...\nWell yeah that's not yeah flip side is ...

Christine the God explained to me under her watch the funders initiated working nontraditional areas such as inequality agenda and climate change\nMixed and what's the driving force behind the stern report on climate change he explains why climate change is not bankers business\nThe central bankers and many of the north and but many of them and some of those in leading countries have recognized that climate change is a major potential ... whole economic and financial instability Ifill battered by storms and hurricanes that the economic instead of the major scale\nAnd we have seen these very dramatic effects of storms and hurricanes causing major economic damage in different parts of the world\nAnd what we've actually seen so far is small very small relative to what we risk\nFor example a bigger I recommend Sunday but almost wrecked New York in two thousand twelve cannot be ruled out\nWith most financial centers near coasts expected ocean rising rates of storms will be severely destabilizing climate change\nShould be a global priority for many reasons box in the short term in my view a pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis I mean one that will willfully ill prepared for\nPete appeal to the direct to the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nEndemic could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent speed through early on in these days we know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of so\nThe by about five percent three trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of sauce really hit the GDP by about closest three percent but it was also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risk premium so that's another problem so according to the size of the epidemic\nWe're talking about the damage in terms of trillions note in billions\n[noise]\nThe failure to be on finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. before separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers a colleague at Oxford University shed independent commission on banking set up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on and on all those friends\nThen the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cold ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe only high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped let's call things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity that those activities in major banks\nShould be in a a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some Japanese or that it puts you in a much better position to deal with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become ...\nBut a position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentration in fewer homes in the u._k. as in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bailout failing banks and to sweets in terms of a merger with bigger banks\nThe result was surviving banks go even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail I mean if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system\nList implies that governments which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's another moxie ... of the bankers' new clothes\nThe size of the largest banks certainly group\nThat will tell you that they did the favor of swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural or nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in market they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they have a privileged existence what they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privileges of too many subsidies that's coming down with the status\nOf being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your lungs\nAre you off to where the measures to prevent the next financial crisis and improve matches who made them worse\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quickest solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nFor growing complexity into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power\nWhich allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products which the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFar from reducing and offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovation that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am and lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide the risks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not\nIt's really a lot of financial innovation is really about clever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily as for for society so yeah it sounded like really you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy it was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void eating discussion of all day\nSaturday away some times in which the public was deceived um miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\nAs the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasingly\nKnown financial institutions such as ... companies mobile phone operators and others issue in credits with very little regulation oversight [noise]\nNew cyber currencies such as bitcoin which are typically avoid the regulate tree radio [noise]\nAs a meeting of new technology innovators of it so God of electric capital which trades digital currencies he told me that it's no accident that corner rose immediately after the\nFinancial crisis as it's aimed to build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by the discredited government authorities\nBecause it was launched into as an aid and it was very much catalyzed by the failure of the financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms that you see recurring and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand age is we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries\nAnd one of the intermediaries fail the entire system fails with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself\nHad some critical design flaws that got I think the ball going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they did not have those fairly\nRecent years have shown that bitcoin and other digital currencies but was not issued by central banks suffer from many of the same failings as other currencies in fact they've been subject to even more volatility and fraud\nBitcoin advocates and other new technology firms typically like to convince us that the new technologies or force for good\nBut the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend for technological change\nFor good but the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend and the ...\nTechnological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk\nThe same technologies which allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminate through social media could be used
