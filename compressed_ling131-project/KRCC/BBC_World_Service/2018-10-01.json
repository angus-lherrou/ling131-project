that actually posed by his own Congress and the U.S business I'm so his threat was that it kind of you know it's kind of it wasn't going to papal he would go ahead with a bilateral agreement with just the United states and Mexico\nBut the reality was he would have struggled to get through that through the U.S Congress and they would've been a huge amount of pressure on him against such a bilateral deal that left kind of outcome from his own business people that was sort of not really a pretty credible threat and the Canadians understood that\nCanada though has had to allow us farmers more access to a dairy market and this was a big sticking point ... wouldn't do this Tuesday's potential dried out of them into this deal for Canada\nSo it's very early hours we're really in the very we haven't seen the details of the tax but my understanding is that what they what the Canadians have agreed it's only a tiny bit more than they already agreed back in the days of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement\nI'm so back then they promised um the members of the TPP which included the United states of course access to that very markets by opening up a little bit over three percent of the dairy market\nAnd my understanding is I haven't seen the tax yet but my understanding is that they've been a tiny bit more than that but this isn't it's nowhere near the radical overhaul and opening up of the Canadian dairy sect that the u._s. was was aiming for it to stop the talks\nComfortable in the neighborhoods necessarily that they they wasn't somebody they could um you know bar a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nThe point is that either because older people are more resilient to worries about learning it\nI think that's a really good point I think one of the things is that we know that when you're very young it is a time when people feel emotions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness\nAnd older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that and we also people who are older to look back and we offer them when they with ammonia civil they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think you know something about ... life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never measured before\nTime when people feel ... very intensely and also this may be the

and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that\nWhen we asked people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the earliest of all they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it was something about more life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never measured before it may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's interesting we're just\nGoing to ask about social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what would it locks in ... in London and the surrounding areas and it'll be

where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other so being independent\nDoes not necessarily a good thing now

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be calmer\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nImpression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change in how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gr off putting global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight five up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual averages ... degree behind twenty sixteen but Michael Mann admits that\nAspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gr off putting global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story ... ... the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public and to policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines\nThat is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nAll right let me think what Iran is not necessarily a harbinger of what we can say anything why do you think of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that can be quite rare and is now ready to call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to be\nWeather of some kind of group does happen every year\nOf course you know All right let me think what is not necessarily are what ... what can I say the reason why we do ... any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that that needs to be\nQuite rare and it's now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here it's of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer and warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season the California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfires\nIn part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts uh so you know you've got a drying

season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire in northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us from our historic emergency the largest fire California about the size of a fabulous\nPiece of\nConditions lived inexperienced fine then yeah queen Davidson a fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term Trump was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of gras Scruggs to add an abundance of drawing on the growth which fueled far storms\nAnd some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking you know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem\nAnd so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but pretty immediately that fire was raising Harris and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and\nUm I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to

affecting a major residential turned walls in itself trying to find but the big one was the fine in Mendocino hills actually a pair of five stars\nImmediately that fire was raising hairs and my

one was the far in Mendocino hills actually a pair of funds started on July the twenty seventh and ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California it was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing to those areas is\nJust all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or were more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next big us was last year in Southern California two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large

win for the U.S and it is but I think in the long term it will be a win for Canadians as well\nOr on that coming soon and the headlines now the Indonesian authorities are scrambling to get more aid and rescue equipment into the into the way say following the devastating earthquake and tsunami many bridges and roads a tile and making it harder to reach the affected areas\nIran says it's fine ballistic missiles into eastern Syria will have more on that and just a moment and so so soldiers from North and South Korea have been gotten clearing land mines on the heavily fortified border\nThose

source\nMorning the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched about six I'm short range ballistic missiles into Syria they claim that this is in retaliation\nLike Bush or your middle to you know it was good in Iran I've been speaking of all these other issues among residents with the Americans being lumped ... or this is Floyd pulled Iran short\nThis morning the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched about six\nI'm short range ballistic missiles into Syria they claim that this is in retaliation of laws terrorist attack that killed about twenty five people and I'm I'm a province of ...\nAnd typically are the laws parade was actually part of a bigger paraded throughout the country that mark the anniversary of the Iran Iraq War so Iranian\nIranian celebrated as a Memorial Day essentially so the attack was I'm a big deal in Iran it was a second terrorist attack Iran had seen in the past two years\nSo it was interesting was seeing that they were actually launching missiles and retaliation now what's worth mentioning is that last year when there was terror attacks and tear on twin terror attacks a week later the IRGC also launch missiles into Syria\nAnd that also happened a week after so this is actually the second time we've seen Iran launch missiles in retaliation for terror attacks\nAnd who is the target to do they think they are targeting in response from a ... [noise]\nUm I think it's also worth mentioning is that initially the blame was put on ... separatist groups\nAnd one group did specifically come out and say that they were responsible for it not done themselves who are based in Denmark but their group inside um Iran and Iraq was responsible and that they had not given the okay\nSo that's very interesting to know but at the same time the Iranian government has been putting the blame on the U.S Saudi Arabia Israel and the United Arab Emirates and they've been saying that they've been back in the separatist groups\nAnd that they've been backing ISIS is so what this attack supposedly according to what we've been reading on state media is that they were attacking text fury terrorists which is essentially another word for ISIS\nAnd it seems that these were I'm focusing on ISIS strongholds in Syria and this is exactly what happened in June two thousand and Seventeen when they did a similar launch in Syria\nThe government has been putting the blame on the U.S Saudi Arabia Israel and the United Arab Emirates and they've been saying that they've been backing the separatists groups\nAnd that they've been backing ISIS so what this attack supposedly according to what we've been reading on state media is that they were attacking techs theory terrorists which is essentially\nAnother word for ISIS and it seems that these were I'm focusing on ISIS strongholds in Syria and this is exactly what happened in June two thousand and Seventeen when they did a similar launch in Syria\n[noise] totally stupid about the ... national resistance this movement the once as you say to split Iran all the ... I think for most people this will be a new name\nIt's a new name for a lot of us as well focusing on Iran or a lot of these separatist groups don't do not have much back backing from the Iranian people and there are at least half a dozen of them that exists now a there was even as it is an initial conclusion about which I thought the group it was\nAnd so um I think that by throwing their accusations that way and also finding that one group had said that they're responsible the Iranian government is able to actually [noise] crackdown on more of the activists inside of Iran the act Arab activists I'm\nThe send the activists in Iran and I think it's another thing that's worth mentioning is when you think of a lot of people tend to think that it's a Sunni majority promise when it's not there actually Shia so for them to the Iranian government to come out and say that these are you a factor Saudi backed separatists groups if not exactly accurate\nIt would mean that there are backing these shapes um groups within Iran which would be very interesting angle to take on although historically they have had some instances like in Yemen during the Nineteen seventies when they hoot these are backed by Saudi Arabia so it wouldn't exactly be unprecedented\nAnd that's the way things look to hold it ... from the Atlantic council you're listening to world updates from the BBC\nThe first

incoming one is happy about it as each other\nWell Mr Lopez Obrador himself hasn't spoken but to his negotiate to have to see how they has who said we celebrate the laugh or agreements on to loaning the fact that his trial after all he said it closes the door to trade fragmentation of the region\nNAFTA to as he could it which I thought it was quite interesting we'll give stability or uncertainties and mixed has come with its North American partners and outgoing president and ... and you had to\nHave said he'd spoken to both prime minister Trudeau and President Trump this morning and cool the agreement a win win win so you know at this stage both found that both sides but at least sounding pleased with the result\nThanks very much well let's turn to the Canadian side of things that this is what President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to explored American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few\nI Want to be very specific\nI Want to be very\nI think Trump likes to scoops of ice cream we understand but will the Canadians like this parts of the deal Jessica [noise]\nWell look this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team not including increasing the slice of dairy market available to us\nButter Jews yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to reverse because she had\nI Want to reverse [noise]\nPresident Trump likes to scoops of ice cream we understand but to will become agents like this possible deal Jessica\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less so for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team that's including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all happy about it they're saying that really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk especially since Canada this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to its dairy market as part of a trade deal notably\nAh with the recent seated deal with the European Union\nNow this could spell trouble for Trudeau in uh the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec were there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what Trudeau is saying today is look at first off the U.S was really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also a promising a full compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some of the sting out of this confession\nAnd what about the personal relationship as being some a pretty ... times between the leaders of kind of the United states in recent months but they're also founding courtroom today what what's your assessment\nCassie I think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump or used to today

back where troops came out saying that Canada would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade\nA Trump came out calling him Meek mild week I and and that really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came to trade\nNow at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like a bit of a ... but\nThe candidate in us relationship has weathered a lot of storms I'm between its leaders leaders have not always gotten along and I think that\nI think it was the most heated around you and around the G ... meeting and get back where true came out saying that candidate would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade I Trump came out calling him Mika milder week I and and not really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when

leaders have not always gotten a lot and I think that that ties you go deeper than that sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica ... thanks very much Gary down here in Washington is a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes as in the post industrial Midwestern states which will be so important to President Trump and his\nPresidential victory do you think this will have an impact on the midterm elections that are coming up\nI think it's possible and I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base of\nThe voted for him to come out and say thank you are in some sense all their votes has never really thank you for things you've done or new for things you promising to do\nAn ... may may do the same but so the president has not to sacrifice something he's given up for example he's insistence on on scrap and who the ... the Nineteen policy of NAFTA which is the arbitration mechanism Canadians of\nOf their own why on that and of course the other big thing that's still in place is the steel and aluminum tariffs twenty five and ten percent both from\nCanada and Mexico those are still in place\nAnd the president saying then to be negotiated as part of his ... says\nGary thanks very much Gary down here in Washington and also I think you to Jessica ... in
