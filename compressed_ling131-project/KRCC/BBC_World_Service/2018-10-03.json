other cases as the corruption investigations have shown over the past few years it come from outright graft\nIt seems almost impossible to anyone and to keep yourself playing\nSome of the politicians

retirement age for men to sixty five\nLife expectancy the average is sixty six well no the house or the parliament is voting on those new measures Moscow correspondent ever rains food joined us have they voted\nI think the discussion is underway at the moment so the Viking should be happening happening fairly soon but do you know we're not expecting any surprises they federation council is not a whole lot of dissent says it's a it's a place which pretty much stumps everything that comes it's way way expecting this to go through that went through the house of parliament and then president pitch in\nTo some potential and in fact I asked his spokesman er just a short while ago when we can expect that and he said that Mr Putin will not be pushing this off\nAnd the reason for doing this because we remember those protests are lots of very fearful of wives of men who had passed away is saying that all men don't live long enough to get the benefit of the pension\nWell that's right I mean specifically the problem is about Russia and men are rushing women life expectancy is relatively high but for men as you mentioned it around about sixty seven\nNationwide as an average that raising the pension age to sixty five is that pretty significant leap a given that the life expectancy it's it's a low still I'm particularly given that many regions of Russia especially in the east it's not too far below sixty five so\nSo many people this is really a problematic law and that's why there's been touched on this mission the communists have come out and fairly large numbers across the country that describing it as a kind of ballistic build up the word that they using and many others are pointing to that you know the big problem\nBut you know President Putin came out on national

come out and fairly large numbers across the country that describing it as a kind of ballistic build up the word that they using and many others are pointing to that you know the big problem\nBut you know President Putin came out on national TV he made an address it with some twenty minutes long\nOr to the nation he obviously has has identified this as a as I think that it's in in the ... in the

significantly for him and so I asked about jihad spokesman today you know does it kind of regret that is how worried all day about the political consequences\nOn Mr ... spokesman said we you know we keep an eye on the right things but right things are not well Dr President Putin that was never an obstacle as he put that to working for the good of the people\nAnd how President Putin described that is that basically fewer pensions pensions means higher pensions and he's saying that the current system is not sustainable but the system will eventually be back to\nAnd she's still pretty popular convert to many of Egypt around the world isn't the\nWhen he is but you know it's interesting just to watch his writings because if you look back to twenty fourteen when Russia annexed Crimea that was a very popular move here on President Putin's writing shop committee Ninety percent of a sea maintaining that was going to be\nA non impossible but it it it has for the next round about sixty seven I think at the moment\nAnd on his back below those twenty fourteen levels so he he's not made of tests alone you know things do stick and it's not just the right thing what's been interesting in recent weeks as what's been happening in the regions of Russia where President Putin's candidate for governor in several regions has been roundly defeated in the elections and what people are saying is that\nHow people are analyzing that is that people have been voting for anyone butts President Putin's candidate and that is interesting\nAnd I think that we'll worry the crime and whatever the spokesman is saying Sarah thank you sir arrange for reporting from Moscow you're listening to well don't face from la [noise]\nDefeated in the elections and what people are saying is that how people

Sarah remind us why these proposals have been so controversial\nWell because of the life expectancy here in Russia are essential a this is a move that President Putin says as a matter of national security says that the pension system is not sustainable as it stands that people are retiring to LA it's costing too much\nBut the problem is that ... the proposal specifically for men to raise the retirement age to sixty five\nNow that's in a country where the average life expectancy is still any sixty seven and I've just done a quick Tulsa of of the regional\nVariations on that showed me that

I was that it was so awkward\nBits and pieces fell off the set this was entirely different she gave I guess what I Would only be described as an remarkably confidence and study defense of capitalism ... conservatism as she called her and most particularly of calls\nHer approach to ... she was basically saying to the sort of gather activists look you may not like my dad was sort of free trade area to deal with the European Union but think about all the alternatives to kale so no jail over chaos of domestic domestic political too\nFree trade area deal with the European Union but think about all the old Senate serves the chaos of no jail over chaos of domestic domestic political turmoil and as you just sort of suggesting that possibly know ... sort of civil\nBut as we all know she was speaking to a very divided audience were the signs of healing between the two sides here's\nWhat I'd say about that she was left still standing despite gazing attacks by pro but particularly anti Europeans she ... a much relatively unscathed but look she has no chance of the woods [noise]\nIt really is important to remember these divisions over Europe have not gone out of way and one speech of course doesn't change the view of many are in her policy about her weaknesses as a leader but here's the thing poll you could say that time a lot of people are thinking well maybe she's not perfect but time is running out of place or after all\nBritain is supposed to be leaving the EU next march\nShe seems to have survived the competence then but I become friends even but the really hard task fuzzy and lie ahead\nDying I Would say so I mean she survived this but looking ahead she has just a matter of weeks now to try and get a deal with the European Union but she has\nSo little room to maneuver and I don't think the u._s. gonna make many concessions because they see a divided weak governments in the u._k. a divided country why should they make concessions but she has little room to maneuver around me she was to give too much away\nThe ... and the policy wouldn't like it if she went for no deal the pro Europeans and businesses what's I Walk on a ... are you doing\nSo it's going to be immensely difficult to get that deal and then have to come back and sell it to a divided policy and I certainly don't want other focus come up from these conferences you know a lot of diplomats

latest from the Tory policy conference this is news now\n[noise]\nNow astronomers believe they found the first some evidence of the existence of an excellent movie not to the moon that old but it's a planet outside our own solar system the team from ...\nTo some evidence of the existence of an XO movie night to the moon that old bits of planets outside our own solar system\nThe team from Columbia University in the U.S had already use NASA's Kepler space telescope to study the premises of nearly three hundred planets the professor David keeping told me that use of the more advanced Hubble Telescope had been the game changer\nWe always thought they were very likely to exist because so many like ... solar system we see so many of them so I think the real question was not so much whether they exist at all but one of the properties how big do they get\nWhy is it important to establish this\nWe are interested in ... for a few reasons one of them is that these moons could be habitable worlds in Iran right obviously that's something that science fiction has a lot of fun with that idea things like\nA ... for example in Star Wars or need the idea is that maybe moons my affects the habits of the of the planet that they ... we think the moon does influence the U.S how to the scene in fact by stabilizing the liquidity of the for example\nAnd finally we want to understand how moons phone we only really have a few example was a ... system the moon appears like a maybe a one off event but is it maybe it's inevitable outcome a planet formation by looking at the Nunes outside of our solar system we have to add to build a deep understanding of how these things are built in the first place\nSo just typically is there an assumption that if a planet has a moon going round it's at least one there is more chance to do that that might be life on the plan is\nNot necessarily but I think if we find another twin for example one of the questions you might ask if you're interested it's habitable is whether it has a moon twin as well for example what heights we know the ocean tides on the U.S are driven by the presence of the main\nAnd those early tides especially when the name was much closer to us early in our history and they even ... played a role in kick starting life on a planet\nWhere is this possible first discovered XO moon\nIt's a long way away eight thousand light is say we wouldn't be traveling that anytime soon missed one is that for the most distant stars that kept to look at 'em and that's why it was challenging for us to pull off this detection and why we needed additional ... get time to do it\nRight the Hubble Space telescope enabled days did it\nLast rights that we saw a hint of their signature with a capital a date that we had three eclipse is of the planet in front of the stock three transits of the pie in front of the stuff from that as we thought we saw a window that could be a moment but we didn't have a conclusive evidence to that point and so we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is ...\nFrom that as we thought we saw a widow that could be a moon but we didn't have a conclusive evidence that points that we asked but time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope and we're able to get a much more convincing sticking out of that\nYou must be looking for the tiniest ... said some way so distant\nThat's why these tiny signatures in ... we really see two signatures which give away the moon we can tell the planet comes into its eclipse GT about an hour to LA that tells us something is pulling on the planet gravitationally and we think that some in\nAnd the second signal that we see is a ... in the brightness of the style which has caused by the moon passing and wanted to stop the shadow of the moon if you like\nIn front of the south so these are tiny signatures but we think we have strong evidence for them\nIt's a thrilling possibility of extraterrestrial life that that most people have felt at some stage and then life something that actually drives the scientific Korea\nTo me it's always been the logical and point of this and that when we're looking for planets lacking some means I think a fundamental question of fundamental driving force behind why we do this has to understand a uniqueness in the universe how unique because the U.S\nThe solar system and indeed ourselves um said to me looking for life on these worlds one day is the final part of that question\n[noise] professor David keeping from Columbia University telling us about the best evidence
