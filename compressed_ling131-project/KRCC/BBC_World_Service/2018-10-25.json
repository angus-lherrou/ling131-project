turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're\nGoing to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nRight let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic human genes et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nHow come I itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged for the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's dumped molten bay she's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you seat never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and this and got some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them executed behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThat were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been sorted themselves and American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that\nI Would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic\nThat's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet sticking it to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society tick the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costing choices than would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives thought infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism then what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority\nView that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of\nFrom the station is about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvied you gets picked up by media around the world and uh because of the ways so provocative\nIt's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points or you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive\nDo you want us points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist biased then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nGo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that enters video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against this information suggesting if you're looking\nFor a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole weapons out certainly fits into a broader pattern\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's ...\nCampaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an act of propaganda well\nI'm going to let John Walsh the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be on verified information or this\nViral retreating is very by real tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo

watch the funders initiated working nontraditional areas such as inequality agenda and climate change mixed on what is the driving force behind us to report on climate change he explains why climate change is now bankers business\nThe central bank as many of the north and but many of them and some of those in leading countries have recognized that climate change is a major potential source of economic and financial instability he feel battered by storms and hurricanes that economic instead of the major scale\nAnd we have seen these very dramatic effects of storms and hurricanes causing major economic damage in different parts of the will\nAnd will have actually seen so far a small very small relative to what we risk\nFor example the bigger I recommend Sunday that almost direct New York in two thousand twelve kind of be ruled out\nWith most financial centers near coasts expected ocean rising rates of storms will be severely destabilizing climate change\nShould be a global priority for many reasons box in the short term in my view a pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis and one that will woefully ill prepared for\nPeter ... the director the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nEndemic could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's real hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago um reduce global GDP by about five percent speed trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of SARS really hit the GDP by about closest three percent but it was also an increase by to hundreds based point in the country risk premium so that's another problem so according\nTo the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions\n\nOf trillions note in billions\n[noise]\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. before separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers a colleague Iraq's with university shed independent commission on banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then the second heading was\nHow to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cold ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe ordinary high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped but it's cool things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be in a a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposure to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperiled domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some Japanese or that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bail out the banks and too sweet and the terms of the merger with bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks could even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail and if they collapsed they would bring down the whole system list implies that governments\nThe big banks are not too big to fail I mean if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system listen points of governments which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's enough a multi ... of the bankers' new clothes\nThe size of the largest banks certainly grew\nThat will tell you that they did the favor of swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural or nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in market they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they have a privileged existence where they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privileges of too many subsidies it's coming along with the status\nOf being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nTo where the measures to prevent the next financial crisis have improved matches well made them worse\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been the first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nGrowing complexity into dependency on the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power which alone physics and max graduates to build financial products\nWhich the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFall from reducing an offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovation that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily useful for society so yeah at some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void in discussion of all the subtle ways some times in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on\nWaiting discussion of all day Saturday way sometimes in which the public was deceived miss sold in older misconduct that goes on in this industry\nHas the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasingly\nKnown financial institutions such as ... companies mobile phone operators and others issue and credit with very little regulate trio besides\nNew cyber currencies such was recording also typically avoid the regulate trade off\nAs a meeting of new technology innovators of ... of electric capital which trades digital currencies he told me there is no accident that corner rose immediately after the\nFinancial crisis as it aimed to build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by the discredited government authorities\nBecause it was launched into as an aid and it was very much catalyzed by the failure of the financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms ISI recurring and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand eight\nIs we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries and one of the enemy to resell the entire system failed with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself\nSome critical design flaws that got I think the ball going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they did not have those fairly\nRecent years have shown that bitcoin and other digital currencies veteran not issued by central banks suffer from many of the same failings as other currencies in fact they've been subject to even more volatility and fraud\nBitcoin advocates and other new technology firms typically like to convince us that the new technologies or force for good\nBut the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend and the for technological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk\nThe same technologies which allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminate through social media could be used for example by people on Facebook to spread fake news\nThe crisis arose because decision makers were blinded\nHis book to spread fake news\nThe crisis arose because decision

I think that they are committed to their economic diversification plan I don't think that would increase any other types of the farms the main focus is really on improving the economy improving

U.S gather such momentum\nWe have three waves of it so initially it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies could make opioids which led to quadrupling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years\nAnd that part is to level like about six times per capita what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen in drug policy and in several generations\nDisaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nSentinel is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab you can make it in your sink\nTherefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet they've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to heroin track or because now you have a drug you can make just as strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that has been imported and the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a ... ... one of the main ended up and solve that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nOf supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so there's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that\nTogether I think we'll add up to setting some lives even though it's not a transformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a message to the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug say ...\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcomes that ad or being addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning it\nOnly one of multiple outcomes that ad or being addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their family so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words we're providing health care

the ... the into Chinese um the Malay and this goes against recent research that concluded conservatively ... there were only two wanting mainland Asia and warm in Indonesia so what defines a subspecies exactly\nSort of Christie is a tiger expose the zoological society of London\nWell in broad to this one criterion would fade at two different species would not normally be capable of breathing together they don't necessarily have to look different with the tigers while they almost logical differences ... animals larger and tighter and obviously fluffy up\nYou can't rely on them I have seen for example some some out and tell us to talk quite large and relatively pile and ready between what's currently regarded as Indian or the end I Chinese tiger it's really quite difficult to

means definitive\nNo I'd I don't think it really makes it different just because the distinction can be found doesn't mean we should split into two groups the consideration national management and the differences between targets are relatively small local ways at the actual adaptations to the habitat\n... while you can afford to split but as soon as your population gets a bit too small to be able to manage it like that then you would think about using them together you need a pragmatic approach rather than as categorized station one\nSo in that respect creating all these divisions does have

meant we've had to split the cat population into two pieces libel captive population if they taught luckily pretty much all of the Malaysian ones right in the Malaysian zoos and most of the anti
