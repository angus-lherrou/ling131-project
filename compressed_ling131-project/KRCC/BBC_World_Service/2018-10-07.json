from the Iranian artist who captured the image\nI really really wanted to show I guess I'd heard that they are human we have such an expectation from her mouth I I really want it to ourselves in that and what it's like to be higher\nI said well maybe really sickening her life\nThat's coming up a little later I have two guests with me throughout the program city a buck an era is hit London correspondent of good news Brazilian television service and the right to not only is it doesn't based Italian economist and writes a looking the rest of no doubt with interest at the Italian government the relatively new\nItalian government and we'll we'll feature and its next budget which I think you've been keeping an eye on what are you anticipating\nFine if they can come from I ... the budget um is due to the present day ... new on the fifteenth ... bad\nA compromise some the budget um is due to be presented today you on the fifteenth till October there's already quite a lot of tension because the new government to us from it's a certain kind of policy in order to lose to grow to [noise]\nUm so uh it goes against them the agreement there was a a reach with the emu enough to dancing them in two thousand twelve to ... and they would contain the budget deficit so now they want to increase it to\n'em but I think that if they want to stay in power\nSo they want to maintain these government which is a coalition government or they will have to find a compromise honorable ice otherwise so cool scene and the government will most likely fall because you know the markets will turn against eight to ...\n... what about the Greek comparison I mean if if if the Italian government decides to do something that you just not approval ... where does that take well\nI mean exactly so or take will will take us that to an economic crisis because either the league come increasingly difficult for each delete to call but it's an services on debt to because we were a lot of interest rates rising so that point the government or will it will have to fall\nWhich could be could be a strategy of a sudden meaning it was the leader of the lead guy because let's not forget is a coalition government to have the lead guy came in with Seventeen percent at the moment in to\nThe opinion polls gave the guy at thirty two percent and the other party of course much noise in English so it could be a political gamble but one way or or down [laughter]\nA easily it's heading toward some an economic crisis of\nSomething of economic crises city I think one of the pieces you recently went to was the tenth anniversary all the big financial worldwide crisis what was it what would you impact on Brazil and and what happened since in that specific tore\nThe unemployment rate is that we've seen in the United states in Nineteen sixty\nToday in fact\nThe unemployment rate was that we've seen in the United states since Nineteen sixty nine\nSo that's that's helping him on I think the problem in looking ahead to the uh the election which is thirty days away it's quite a ways away lots can happen a lot has been happening in the United states [laughter] um but I think the problem is is that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections\nAnd um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats um it is a ... it's going to be a state by state results um it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats take control of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIs it all sort of ... to ... the Democrats are clearly against something most over three Donald Trump put people are less clear about what their full\nHeight I Do think that that's a very good point because it seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear\nThan it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to when\nI'm what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump's they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme Court\nRepublicans have one that fits conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority there um and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican and Susan yet as them would have\nContinued and perhaps even grown over the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument that if the Democrats take control they will impeach Brett Kavanaugh I'm so to try to keep that concern that fear\nAt the top of people's minds is one way of making sure that Republicans stay committed um again I I think we can say much more about this in a week or two when we see how opinion has changed now the Kavanaugh is on the court\nSaid thank you very much for coming on or caffeine front which is

relationship is strained at the moment on a number of\nIssues techie sided with cats over Qatar's blockade by Saudi Arabia and neighboring Arab states tacky support to the Muslim Brotherhood which has

World Service\nThe Venezuelan ... Rojas has lived in America for seven years but her family is still in Venezuela and she goes back when she can she recently played a series of sold out concerts in Caracas which is bringing in London for the first time on the twenty fifth says November at the E F G London jazz festival\nBut I've been speaking to her about her music and the problems facing the country\n\nIf you listen to my music you think that I'm from Spain you think that I I grew up in the south to Spain but actually not I'm from an island in Venezuela called ... die land\nAnd I didn't even grew up listening to these kinds of music I I actually grew up listening to Christine Aguilera Celine Dion nothing like what I Do now\nBut then I just got very interested in this type of music and I think it's because of their honesty and how ... it is you know when you listen to the music and then I just met ... which is like the perfect person to do these kind of music he's like the king of flamingo in Spain\nSo they kind of easy on doing is a mix of folk music from Venezuela and also you hear traces from Spain and from English I Would say\nThat\nMentioned ... ... ... in London I think you're going to be performing a song\nYou mentioned how long does I think you're going to be performing a song that he's written about what's going on now in Venezuela and give us a little flavor of of what you're saying and much will\nSo this song actually she called me one day from Spain and he's like no I just open the newspaper and the first thing that I saw was a situation in Venezuela\nA I mean here already knew of course about it uh because well my family is still there and since we're from a new look from these island it doesn't affect does as much as a cop it all I guess and I'm Talking about\nFood or a you know crime a but when he read it he said that he'd eat really touched she's hard and he told me and I just wrote this and he sent me this song and he was like I wrote it I mean I talk a lot about it with him so he knows how I feel\nAbout my family and everything we've been through so do some checking a little bit about me wanting to go back to being away from my country for seven years I left because of my career\nBut of course I miss my family my dad has been hurt me singing since I left it's been seven years he can our country to the United states so he hasn't her missing since I left\nSoda\nMan he said they sent\nMillion\nAnd I actually just went back in March for a concert at age ... and that was the first time after seven years what was that like going back to Iraq has pointed\nIt was crazy actually cause they never go to get our guys when I visit and I I've been trying to visit at least once a year but this time but it wasn't in March with my first time stopping and ...\nIs very different of course since I left a lot of people has left so actually it's not even traffic actually traffic was as crazy as it is in New York and he was very very emotional for me because given a concert there with the people you know with my people\nAre in singing a song that it's called ... which is my single where I talk about the island that I'm from and the people that are that live there\nHe was very touching very touching it was the first thirty minutes just wanting to cry it's been one of the most beautiful countries have had in\nTry to be one of the most beautiful countries have had in my life\nOut of\nThese cultures ... sold out what's going to move to\nYeah and I it was the last minute thing because I was just going to give to ... and they sold out and then uh one of my friends are using the industry she was like now like you really have to give a concert in ... and I'm like are you are you sure\nYou know people are waiting for you like well let's see and then he was to sold out concerts was a big surprise and a beautiful moment\nI mean the original ... is not to to sound surprised that it comes to buy you should be sold out but it sort of cultural incorrect ... sold out at the moment\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tore because it's not worth it like in the economy side economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they tried to make ... early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater\nSo yeah for me was also surprised that it was sold out even though it was the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go and sing for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country to reduce highlighted the moment full suddenly all the wrong reasons do feel that sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about who to to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nOf color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually\nIt comes naturally that we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the ... can I say that yeah from the situation because I talk to them everyday and they're living at you know\nSo I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because we're what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people young people with a smile\nAnd people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face gets very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for me\nAnd then the good times wants mugger redrawn like\nIf you really have to visit it's now because I'm from their release you all go to admit that yeah I Know I uh really beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's been Ninety degrees the whole year\nI Know you may sound bad for you is actually very it's amazing because we have to wind up ah the food is grade people are happy all the time every time I show pictures to people there like what the hell are you\nDoing here [laughter] take me to ... and another is playing in London for the first time of the E F G London jazz festival the twenty fifth of November to some photo brief words from you both but it's an interesting insight into into somebody performing abroad because she has to be ruled by and large and reflections on family she's missing what was going to go back home\nFor the one thing to call attention when you're talking to her when you started to touch on the delicate political situation it was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship Brazil\nWas a coded language of the things that you want her to pass it but you couldn't actually say yeah cause you are you worried about what will happen to family exactly and she's got family there so she was word\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting that she said people to start for college for the courts or might cut I got used to be ... and mainly ally Sandy I mean I actually have a friend living there\nAnd um I Can't understand that say concert was sold out so I agree\nWith both of them and said well listen we're going to hear a bit more of a music [noise] going to say thank you to both of you for joining morning trying\nTo get I\n[noise]\n\nOf the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio contest eight PM American public media with support from see three I O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial ...\nUm surprisingly to the states dumped the hurricane capsule of the world there's a lot of research happening hit into how they work and how to mitigate their effects and as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we could stop harkens altogether\nBut before that I Want to start with some basics what so hurricane and how does it for them why they say many of them here in the southern tip of the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nBig told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment for the international university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first ever hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explains how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans\nTakes its energy from the warm waters of the sea and hurricanes work work steam engines the ocean as the board or that of course the wind blowing around in circles the turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert as tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture the metaphor but from what the scientists sits morally true\nMeteorologists always talk about how butterfly flaps its wings and Omaha can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car in so long ago about every four days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something so you get\nSeventy or eighty goes during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane\nEvery one of those could turn into something so you get\nSeventy or eighty or goes during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need room the will to visit their particular recipe\nIn the ocean surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in the water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least its own monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a student like Florence hits the coastline shiny ... is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the ... mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm theory and the purpose of that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide\nToo if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening that didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve that forecast to by law and order that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coats and since then we've been improving the forecasts what kinds of tools to use to track how can\nWe use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft\nTo collect data overland we'd we launch radio sons bitter weather balloons\nWe have buoys out in the ocean we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things didn't help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane I'm a motor they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives a sort of a reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those a thunderstorm that hurricane are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a a cylinder that you'd poster poster inside what is it it is\nYou've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a a cylinder that you ... percent poster inside what is it\nIt is a drop one son does a GPS drop one son and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with these instruments\nTo our morning outpouring Hurricane Florence making landfall thousands hundreds of thousands

that to make a hurricane you need very particular conditions for one you need the ocean will to to be more than twenty six degrees Celsius it might sound implausible but what if you could cool the seat to stop a superstorm\nBefore we came out to Florida we paid a visit to Stevens sofa in America is professor at the University of Edinburgh he told us that is exactly what he plans today and he

system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment in which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nAmerican Meteorological society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from World expo so often it's finished

right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\n[noise] one of them that we have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage and the Carolyn is just a few weeks back\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something rather comma\nLet me issue a mea culpa because our group was one\nEvents but as the hurricane season started his models with suggesting we were heading for something Robert comma\nLet me issue Amelia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign made landfall rabbit raised with scale fool when some of the Atlantic side clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event\nOr we saw that with and without a climate change signaling

from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great ... of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of a vent to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained\nAny part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without\nGreenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecasts with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as on a certain temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they're very specific package ... that's ... associates it with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light of Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nLarge part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic\nAlmost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region the warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic book potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic a cozy even greater along they may be protected in many of the events that have marked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most summers and recovery more poorly each winter\nJulian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flood that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it will still survive\nFor ourselves with Kimmy Schmidt stark Eli camper on this week's wait wait don't

this was echoed also to the BBC by all she fuel for the simple piece of advice don't tell you a sofa appalled asking why a very\nCommon thing for rivers after suicide is why did this happen or could have done something to prevent it why did I see it coming and we can answer those questions on a couple of levels we can understand mental illness and depression better and realize that there are psychological and physiological factors that contribute to\nSuicide but on the other hand\nThere often are no answers at all and only about one in four suicides leaves behind a suicide note and even that may not give a accurate sense of\nThe person's state of mind [noise] an analogy that I have found helpful is that if you break your leg and you go to the doctor and say why did this happen\nAnd the doctor says well you are running and you've tripped and you hit your bone at this angle and it ... the bone and that's why you broke your like\nIn heat and gives you the explanation but then walks away and doesn't set the bone that's not helpful what we need is not just an explanation of why did this happen we need the doctor to heal us and so that's really what's going on when people are asking the white questions we assumed that\nAsking why questions will give us comfort but the answers don't we just need somebody to come alongside us and I tend to are broken hearts\nSo both ends Dana it's very important to make it clear to anyone who's considering suicide just how devastating this will be for those left behind his will Dana says she would impress on them\nAnd know that\nFor those left behind his ...
