may\nI spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same of an income to radically different conclusions and to me this one feels the worst oh I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours\nAnd then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting and then since at hearing we've had this week\nOf waiting for the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide\nI mean like they had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake center second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nOn a mass life or death [noise] with no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBut those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all [noise] let me be the Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise] by judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see his tortured phase\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided didn't seem like a no on Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what it was going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is yours that way\nThe Jews were them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nNear and tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed its mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator [noise]\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJeff Flake fees can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was ... you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination\nEnglish confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled Archie and I was one of the two women and that confrontation with it or play good morning good morning when that elevator door closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks\nHas been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks in mind is not true first of all I saw him shake his head no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women in the morning that they have any mind\nAlso we talked about it wasn't\nAnd this morning that they might\nAlso we talked about it wasn't safe and there was anything it was the\nThing is just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the

like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe ... making fun of themselves we talked about that for for like the men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who the we believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there's likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today and and just have a little\nSad and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this rain today and go and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happened here\nThe night after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't as off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nOr any decision on a boat um has been it's just\nA debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was it was pretty raw you know [noise]\nMm next morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the end you've got to come back to\nSettle for something a bit of says\nHe goes to the elevator

read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nStarted the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads the said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both\nFor last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am

not for me to tell\nYou how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n[noise]\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament commitment and\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMyself was fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\n... southern southern so the Senate and a lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking bed a staple cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explained this job how it works\nUm just the nine of us and um\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge it to the\nIf the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved\nUm we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four cases and it's not just reverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping

anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play\nGolf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raises hands that\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nThey're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the

minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious or you know here's some eastern guy talking about

decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with that want to make right with another person usually it's something they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince\nEveryone to choose life imprisonment when\nIn fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote fan could have cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed [noise]\nI couldn't let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven may and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing\nThat there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message and how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin reply but I didn't\nI didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers under sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really rug things [noise]\n[noise] a few months\nFeel like a really red and things are\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was at the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judas cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family\nEspecially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] for not doing well should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying\nShame leads to inertia and it's even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain and our until it has acted upon by an external\nForce in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too\nForward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forward to her original email to Sven once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it some expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness\nThe Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences and which one\nGesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nCommitted represents I'm joking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food but she can't the opera fusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea know\nMaryland is a child and stately with smiling eyes as she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to it in the armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of the one that everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off it's worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our policy is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for and men working with her son's lawyers to

all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I feel like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nUm [noise] I'm\nTen years after the trial and every one of your friends or family have\nAll moved on to win Maryland rent fans article\nAnd she saw him someone like her and someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that since\nThe death penalty\nI had that I hadn't really died they didn't even register because I'm just like you
