{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KRCC", "content": "By Tara Nolan advisory services offering a class on retirement planning and the twenty first century a two day clown starts October twenty third at six thirty PM details at seven or nine two one zero forty to forty two\nLater today on this American Life one month before Seventeen people died and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida school did this intense training everybody in the school wide revamped new procedures what they were supposed to do in case someone\nLater today on this American Life one month before Seventeen people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida the school did this intense training everybody in the school wide revamped new procedures what they were supposed to do in case someone showed up at school and started shooting and we wondered did it help\nSeventeen people die on this said was did make things worse\nTeachers when later today [noise]\nStay tuned in Ninety One point five K. R. C. C. because this American Life is coming up next\nYou're listening to southern Colorado's NPR station\nK. R. C. C. E. N. K. R. C. C. H. D. Colorado Springs Casey Ceylon to Casey cs dark ville and K W CCF em woodland park streaming online at K. R. C. C. dot org\nCurrently in Colorado Springs is fifty nine degrees today will have some nice guys with the highest sixty four\nAt the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill and the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district ... Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not say their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team is a pollock routes them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in the small safe that have been installed in locations of the school [noise] I saw the ride a bike trails and then all of them the goal as to render their safe get the guy out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought\nOkay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks set a fire during these drills\nOne of them is the only woman on the team was pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school I saw that brought a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drill okay we're going to protect the decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills so the first little\nGlitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into this if you had to put your finger on the sensor is\nAnd a little tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shooter [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six twelve\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun he's wearing a bulletproof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one of\nThese shootings and other kids and killed up and up in this way [noise]\nElementary away when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles\nRunning down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are\nAnd it's like this happens automatically when the school bus into lock down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything but just timing the response and it wasn't great\nWas an attorney for ... oh yeah\n[noise] ...\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go [noise] [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything it just timing never side and it was great\nThat wasn't the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was the doors [noise]\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nBut I I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea\nAnd even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force and so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should be done that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target pills close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target should you\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility of somebody else getting her\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting her [noise]\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it\nBe me who hurts\nA student at my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll pass to dissipate the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to where people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago this American Life America ... stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nGlen ... will never be\nPretty sure that's trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nDon't think they could have been more for parents knew what it is [noise]\n[noise] pretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example whether that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do me what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nCasualties have been people that are going\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi in winter park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas's at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills old school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every day says what occurred black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise] knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nEmergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every ... this is what a code black it this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were apps not silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced roads blanks bet ate a fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused\nDouglas came out of that training expecting an unannounced roads blanks the age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she glance to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building looking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThere they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are reading by me under screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in a doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise] [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nTime we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught or you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway a group of small enough to fitness applied caught it must have told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet\nIt was hot and dark except didn't faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she tax cheats on attacks to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blow it out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like it was open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure\nI'm Still not your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nAnd then the police have said this is a police anyone in here\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I said it I'm not sure what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em so her door was open up to the\nTo the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived [noise] got Beagle and the room next to Stacy used at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway be\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind\nActually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study\nBoth told me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has said lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nSituation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the effective in these drills at Xavier University and as a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into this a civics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done but she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumed by talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yeah [noise] but the idea that this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShell says people need many more options many more ways to respond to the shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort and fighting basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually curse how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with this\nBonds was shooting sometimes you Daniel room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about actually curse how she'd stood in the doorway grabbing up dozens of scared student from ever that\nBreak from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet\nI wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did they actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWho don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWho don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nIs [noise] [laughter]\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're ... ... to ... honey you're doing it now okay\nName is John present ski\nLet it go ... go crazy are hard\nTo [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're OK\nYeah to kill you honey you're doing it now okay\nHis name is John present ski he graduated last year\nThere across the set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved\nHe said she always trying to be strict with him because ever keep 'em that fought for very long\nJust breeze taken nice to press taken nice the rat [noise]\nOkay okay [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of brush enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad suddenly switches gears start selling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know before I was going on in this world that can go through with ... district for your drug stores are still able to get\nYou plan to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun people leaving the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories like bump stocks person could buy\nHowever Sani says they don't push their political beliefs on survivor it's when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for\nGrieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists to believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nThen two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed and Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips is ran into him face to face and a gun control of that and he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere is truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved demanded with threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm after watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming just\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and [noise] he said um there's been a shooting what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nWas a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screamer so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook were twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings at that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces\nI said that's what we look like five months ago\nWas that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other uh they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like\nThey're hanging onto each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents to acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents about kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nTo filter now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moments that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no expert than what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids photos to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light mon brothers should they should you know Seamus you were shouldn't you know let me explain something to your right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips has been a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand but the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple of from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland Monica in that store at\nI met them at their house there is something was neck he was the captain of Carson when team was about to go to the University of Indiana\nMe because it's so hard for people to understand but the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial [noise] [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son and the shooting at Parkland Hanukkah and that store at\nI met them at their house or something was Nick he was the captain the Parkland when teen who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis on its when
