the wire over and over undecided than seem like a no on Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week there's if we can made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nHow producers though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I

saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was ... you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country

is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happened at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happened here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford

the jury instructions\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone\nTo choose life imprisonment when in fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote fan could have cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nCouldn't let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should or given me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match permissive ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nIt wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match permissive ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nTo begin to apply but I didn't I didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and the sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really rug brings up\n\nA few months after spend received Maryland's email an execution date with that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and you'd have to carry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of is deet\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nThey're not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or as even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by next door\nBut he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nWe're not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not trying\nShame leads to a nurse or even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you\nEntered object will remain and our until it is acted upon by an external\nForce in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue it reads and I hope I'm not being too\nForward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forward to her original email to spin the once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nOr tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nRecommends I'm joking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering her food that she can stop refusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea Maryland is tall and stately with smiling eyes so she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty

people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off it's worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our politics the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard
