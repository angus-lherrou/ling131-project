buildings mostly empty no kids around the district in rural Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team are we to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team was pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\nI saw that brought a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the near safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into this have you had to put your finger on the sensor is like a single\nAnd tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shooter [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun he's wearing a bulletproof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one of\nThese shootings another to kill not enough of this way [noise]\nElementary awareness and elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has a middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there is a door there\nAnd it's like this happens automatically when the school bus into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nStarted driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are

one\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't going to turn it into the ... the first yeah oh yeah it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though\nBut I I talked to John the principal about this you know I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea\nAnd even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn\nAnd so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you should be done that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis was a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before your costs\nWhich is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class

that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one at a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed you but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise]\nThese shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks in past to dissipate the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help from the BBC\nChicago it's this American Life America last stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ...\nGlen ... will never be pretty sure that's trying to figure out the best way to prepare for

it's still not enough to where people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help from WBEZ in Chicago it's this American Life America ... stay with us\nMhm mhm mhm mhm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do with me what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nCasualties have the people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the old school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWant you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for a fire for every period for every ... this is what a code black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with\nShe believes in a good hard think and being proactive

is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced road blanks the age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second in our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrify kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not\nWhat the drill was she knew it was real [noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nThe sound how is it the kids are running

body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol I follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice that um [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and\nShe kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from\nA different class she pulled in from the hallway group it small enough to fit in a supply of cod that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet and it was hot and dark except students faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door\nThe hallway um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on and when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I said it I'm not sure what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here we're in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat's it told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott legal in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway be\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway that\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school

rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... bad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you Daniel room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access\nI Would read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say they're the gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea

resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually curse how she'd stood in the doorway grabbing up dozens of scared students remember it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now that she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked and barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school sweating hide [noise]\nBut when I asked her what the drill is four she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nPeriod to traumatizing for kids\nWho don't pretend to crash on an

up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved he said she always trying to be strict with him the can never keep coming up front for very long\nJust breeze taken nice to you for taking nice the rat [noise]\nOkay okay [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he cut his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the evidence is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs are way is ... district for your strong doors are so able to hit\nAnd he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories like bump stocks I presented by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible\nFor grieving parents to avoid the politics

Alex Jones that our daughter never existed and Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several destination law suits when the Phillip says ran into him face to face at a gun control a bad he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in broken up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things that Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm after watching money in Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Japanese prime called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise] [noise]\nAnd over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie wasn't college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Japanese prime called Sandy from the theater the minute\nI picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse collie and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it will show horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts that\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown than he says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nAbout it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't

the room and\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the Philips has said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents a lot of kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moment that launch themselves as to what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and cherry scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal my own brother should they should you know the same as you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not the same person I never will be the shooter as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups\nFor their family in front of the comprehensive they want you to move on what they want\nYou to get back to normal my ... brother should they should you not the same as you were shouldn't you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be the shooters were obsessed with this real you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial [noise] [noise]\n[noise] without support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son and the shooting in Parkland Monica in that store at\nAnd let them at their house or something was Nick he was the captain the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on its when
