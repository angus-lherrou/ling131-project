a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that moment\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you

couldn't do it I was too shy and though a lotta times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably thought what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nOoh\nEvery time the

it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastating if I hurt anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to

myself as where at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish\nNot the same as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to Iran I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of\nToys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things I mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that case had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had said that you just put it more serious in general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that ... people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I decided I wanted for myself and\nYou can try to return to childhood by

diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli status American Adam grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York [noise] his brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel\n[laughter] to me [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know that the thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared as way to lead his nation [noise]\n\nNow are are regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge use of the world stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out with all due three here comes out of his own capital [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah\n[noise]\nInteresting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh

sixteen\n[noise] yeah [noise] the\nJews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably the trailer

angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life and then that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that\nBut I don't know I mean maybe but maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much angry about being the future\nPrime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know\nBut every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be [noise] you know one of the great\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen\nYear old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very\nVery disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio peace\nIt would seem like I it's settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that she had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded when Michael B\nFord by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box it was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on to the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIs history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is it pretty street place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise]\nGot aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a\nOn the phone back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how magnificent and I'm actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord of effort that was pretty amusing\n\nBut not a lot about it um it actually good for me thinking along [laughter] I'll pick your path\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over him is that in both pretty\nI Am nine feet tall\nCome see giant in eight pm on what\nScott had no idea who put the nuts\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nScott decided he would go to the cloud of dispense aside time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nHe gave giant man a booming voice\nPattern even know exactly with something like you know I'm trying to you know just the you know loud but just kinda
