Nineteen eighty two sixteen a cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and there's Susan Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has made some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems

that I never saw her again [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with\nJimmy seemed like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer for that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do you remember

tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess ... maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember it used to have found that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we still have that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded well\nHow was desperately I guess I was looking for a family regularly but I mean it\n[laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't make that I mean that people are complicated now what I really\nWanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy no a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\n\nEvery time it's subjective are hard times came up on your settle hesitancy in tune to it\nAt first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly it wasn't until we've\nBeen talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that I've been knowing under our entire Congress\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah [noise]\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter at the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but I\nI Would be devastating if I hurt anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan Europe for life that I remember\nAs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but\nI didn't think of myself as where at all but Susan joined reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nOf anxious and bookish\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to

planned it send your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that ... had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I had ... ... you just need more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nYou know Mm\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story and how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face departure she said she mostly remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nShe said she must be remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keeps people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I didn't I did I Want it from I Know\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at ... or visiting the old

clearly and do a little work as well as some intelligence helping out I Am a geek in truth I'm far from it when you first\nRead that to yourself when you first side of your reaction was it was pure horror\nRecently Adam Davidson and occasional contributor to our program found his old high school diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli data's American Adam grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York [noise] his brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the the thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to lead his nation [noise]\n\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary remain other sure let's see um\nSo much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sick and\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge use of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch out what will generate here comes the Adam was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] now that's a that's a kind of amazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me

at some point or there'll be a ball game or something and the other thing is he right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nSixteen I have such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life then that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having\nCreating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much ... about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be [noise] you know one of the great ... ...\n[noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience with a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen\nYear old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo see her this this radio appease\nIt would seem like I had

done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by double being and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like the story from this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on to the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like a story on our show\nIt history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is it pretty street place\nEntertainment for most people

the back and they started yelling and screaming about how Jayanti was magnificent he [noise]\nI think actually right after that I might have gotten back and said yeah you know I Am also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord of thought that was pretty amazing [noise]\n[noise] do\nYou get a lot about it um [noise] it actually good for me thinking along [laughter] killer
