D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan ... is in this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh\nOf the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight still uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up Horton question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was it and getting jostled from we we had to take a we had\nTo take a moment no we got us actually all very a a word for a second because rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nI'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy kind of noise making machinery that\nI guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't then said can you tell a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void [laughter] you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind the audience is whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nAre little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release urology um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the word\nI guess they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release urology um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um or that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nA live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people off\nMy ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light trucks will review a

American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's after you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick\nAnd Nike\nAnd ... says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked you think that people should go see the movie and ... says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film\nAnd I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that uh kept arouse I think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times or the flags standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know ... and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag a we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase the not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new movie first
