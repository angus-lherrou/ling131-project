it's just it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having\nA baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that process is just so so different\nYeah it it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and if we're ... a clinic from the point of view Catherine ... figures including the doctor you're seeing her legs on the ... through her point of view of yeah everyone abuse so many women have had so many times [laughter]\n[noise] um yeah and um the um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great doctors it's a very\nBizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hare who played Dr ... and uh he it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry\nUm because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her her\nAnd cause her and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in the\nA on the cover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and [noise] it's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her\nQuote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti

dog but\nBefore you kept changing the deadline is remember\nA whole will start as soon as I finish to play a\nLot after I get the story published finished the book\nKnow enough to [noise] uh I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation a\nLot of women has said he hit forty one\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem fault that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid but [noise]\nAll the doctors that we're talking about a\nLie in bed in the turtle a my old eggs in one of the middle of an idea of an oh what a surprise your sperm it's like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa what so suppose nothing\nSo that with Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nMean blaming myself yeah were you like the body and Catherine my and kept her on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um you know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean\nI think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started to understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she is you really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a licensed to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nOf away from the work that you are pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and that we work had gotten in a way of\nOf becoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you are getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nOr or I was you know then I decided that does go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to having a kid I mean the money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this

about a couple of played by Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various\nFertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and sons of Beverly Hills\nSo we've spoken after each of you if you joined films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was not a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well did you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person\nYou know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it\nAnd I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character so you make three feature films\nTwo of them are about being a daughter and the new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and he was broke\nBasically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him\nTo um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise] I'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there is a strange men need between\nYou between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so and no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is\nUm is family and you know the\nOf having one and wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nLiving several years with your father and not being well parents did during that time has majors so focused on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother to arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was just you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] that's cool [noise]\nAnd um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my\nMother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail\nOriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of [laughter] so what is it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs uh of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting us ...\nFocus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you back on our show thank you so much thank you\nTimer Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "03"}
