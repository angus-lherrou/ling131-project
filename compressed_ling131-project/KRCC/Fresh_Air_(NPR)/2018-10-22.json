getting [noise]\nVigil was a waste of a secret I should've gone out there in Iraq and told them the wrong because I get a better response because if you told me about this [noise]\nThe only one without\nListen McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you and this new movie so congratulations on it this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way but I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy for an in it and you're very no physical comedy\n... did her way but it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent at an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh [noise]\nAnd you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the Thirteen people at each performance do [laughter] I don't have much impact\nSo I skim through the memoir 'cause you know the movie is based on a memoir by Lee Israel and um\nSo I might have missed the ... that you don't really get a sense of who she is physically what she looks like and the I don't think there's a lot of insights into her personality so where did you go for those insights and did you have a sense of what she looked like [noise]\nNo there's energy true to leave personality there there is not a lot of her personal life\nTo get to take a look at and also it's before everyone felt the need to document you know every single moment of their lives\nAnd uh I was lucky enough so that two of our producers David you are now had known her for Twenty years he was you know had a very big part in kind of poking prodding her to even write the memoir which she\nSays she was very difficult about again true to leaves kind of caustic perfectly nature she didn't want to read about her so she didn't didn't like the idea of it and finally did which worked out well for her but\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really\nWasn't the point of it oh okay and none of none of us felt that\nDo gross that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this growth scene for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny [noise]\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the only thing that appeals to mean does seem funny in kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately [noise] even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] within ... okay some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of my doing gross out scenes and through your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended\nBut it wasn't intended and it was really talked about\nI'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular\nAt least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting to do that and not in real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but\nThe most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and lives le mans teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other couple the Leslie manpower a couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me on one language Catherine language I mean I get a relay what these two balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her saying next door\nMusic man maybe if I looked more like this fake couple bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like to enjoy my legs and kick you out in the jar with my phone\nJust really scaring me this is what happens when you cornered rat you corner me I won't you through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this was forty uh\nIt's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yours\nHope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but\nYeah a lot of the first time I watched that back I\nKept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before [noise] yes I've had\nA ... internally I have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the part of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nHer own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher\nYou know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air and here's a song from the soundtrack of can you ever forgive me

heat and now stars in the new film can you ever forgive me as a biographer turned literary forgery\n[noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your\nTop off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever\nWorked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shouted now not just like OK buddy you know God it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more at work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with\nNow he actually feels bad like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ... ever present or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light men\nFlashes ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager\nLaugh he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... shot like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [noise] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can they be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know at all of the day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to sink your teeth into it's like\nThe perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with corks in eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even dislike people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nEccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for a female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] I say I'm a real I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why does and she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why\nShe always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars\nSome other time [laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nOn red ...
