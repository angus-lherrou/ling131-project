know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven\nA little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy a about life but if you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality
