Jonah Hill became famous for playing a high school student in the comedy super bad that was just one of his comedy films along with a forty year old virgin knocked up and funny people that was produced and or directed by Judd Apatow\nHill received Oscar nominations for best supporting actor for his dramatic roles and money ball and the wolf of Wall Street this year he co starred in the guts fans than film don't worry he won't get far on foot and he starts with Emma Stone in the new Netflix series maniac\nJonah Hill just made is directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders\nThe film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ... who wants to be a skateboard or and be

take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts\nAnd spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking the skaters are played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nI'm no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding is so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um\nThe treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know it just made an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot of ...\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that in self punishing about that\nAnd there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where\nAre you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nI'm at my scars on his cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that Comey is has the flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learn some of this stuff would\nYou have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream what'd you unreality [laughter] ever considered an escape or now I landed a case\nFor it in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back\nAnd we'll talk about some of the films he starred

starring in movies like Superbad money ball\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting whenever\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts [laughter] but I maybe should have waited till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn no excuse me she's Michael so\nOK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] when are you gonna go legit you know [laughter] but uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think of that story and character in that way and to make connections\nWho would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine the on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to because I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I did so big them but I was ... not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nYou know like a ... and what he was tell them that I disobeyed them but I was ... not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this do that for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder and Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nThe new by our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its

an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first the kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties\nYeah and and now like in the past I don't know ... years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me [noise]\nAnd then in Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to\nThat if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow\nA mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't you hear a scene\nFrom a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nWritten by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\nAnd I try\nActually see that call around\nWhen the only thing I think we live in a state\nSchool food for your forceful affairs or realtors right was [laughter] what do you do [noise]\nFor work what is your stockbroker\nGermans furniture so you so right [noise]\nYou know do a wreck for myself I'm trying to put it together in my school was it in a same build on just I'm not\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nOn Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious ...\nOn Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm sure there are known to have to say how much money [noise]\nFor told you so many thousands of technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nYou show me pay stuff for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nI'm going to find a reason I quit and he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets Susan is on her business or well the things about him to like phosphorus than white T life I got to deal with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just to look more wash\nOkay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\nIs going to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned\nWas that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity and the\nAnd I like\nHow unabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of\nYou as a parable father ... in a terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also instantly loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third so I'm going to play an excerpt of uh\nOkay so this weekend this Saturday you going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most to me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with step mother\nAt a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa Bayer and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate listening to NPR over my nightmares will take place in Syria and stalked Terry Gross [noise]\nMaybe good listening and don't want to train whistle every once in a [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] but I was shocked and in light of the name check I you know on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment I was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick vacated lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style and I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times [noise]\nSkills comedian and and that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell
