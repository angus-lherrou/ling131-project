C. dot ORG\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in ... tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how it's a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money ... Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nUm ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollars on from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate or ... gave Donald Trump inlaws\nOr we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans now one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is the head in many cases um use were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run two two for Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch I'm sure it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nTo use the money for many of his ranch or see how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nSomeone under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to lose father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments it\nAlso see that when his so and then when he would fall ... was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn and according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money and it's three and a half million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino chips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and it was caught us all to the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nTo the family and what he did so what you're saying I think that at the end of read Trump's life were toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that for Trump perceived to this is an attempt to put his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David

Frank ... own at this time of his death ... awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this return them for a million more bucks on that return\nAnd they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nAvoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] um I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books are the shell based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] part of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well see if he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when the actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with them\nAbout you know his daring do of cutting himself off the ... it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the myth of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nThan that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off and it gets really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times as basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the ...\nSeparate room and the New York times says basically sealed off everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room um who cleaned it who is allowed\nBecause you know [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] I thought of it but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy for a little right than there really\nA little costs are full of it too I Would imagine that other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could well", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "18"}
