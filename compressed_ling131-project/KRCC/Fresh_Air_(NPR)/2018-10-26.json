Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose\nHerbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also a lot of ground at the time I well yeah\nThat's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I've kind of gone around the block\nThe anything he was kind of like fluid in his ... yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element and flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was the you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you get used to it you saw what you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of hoping to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one\nThing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or I ...\nKnow and and ah I once said you know his first wife was talking about ... being cheap introducing a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all of these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took a loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever have given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around\nThere was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was that for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a [noise]\nYou know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt him and he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize that meant song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of ... kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they ... didn't work for a living read\nWell it's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting poppy\nWell that's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a band yeah rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know ... you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited knee coast participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics writing about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention and ah you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was a pretty Ernest thing and the Warhol seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who hadn't heard them yet you know unheard I'm amazing they are so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think Lou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go\nThe first album and we're in the process of making the second one I drink Lou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline beer now and he's got to go you know that needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way or the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note my\nGuess is Anthony ...

Curtis he's written a new book about Lou Reed at a new biography called Lou Reed life liberate second solo album after the velvet underground broke up a transformer was produced by David Bowie\nAnd you know always of course famous for all of his you know persona is and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on the lead in terms of his self image and his persona\nWill you know Lou had complicated feelings about that um\nYou know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Bowie was kind of the you know the coming thing\nAnd uh you know bully you you know has with Lou like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his older you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so he you know but we offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise] you know so little of course yeah once you got the hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resented and\nYou know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced I'd album with ah with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are you know that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWho want to hear walk on that ... from that album and um this was his only real like radio hit\nAlbum for Lu one way or walk on the ... from that album\nAnd um this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big ... I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about\n...\nCame from Miami ... hitchhiked away across the U.S they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the\nSick along in the wilds a and said hey honey ...\n[noise] ...\nCandy canes from now on the island\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head friendly read but it's not architects from your book like he was a cat he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band to have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more than that yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I live in a high school but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrageous\nTo be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lie in the highest but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and a crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing records [noise] um\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record it a a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that with ... before Lou did it\nAnd um that's how they live in Iran and he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nI don't honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm ... and his album St hassle you you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away\nWearing you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nSue became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise]\nYou know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean or got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was as out there as anybody could be he also turned on it\nAnd are often not with that you know that much um [noise]\nBut uh\nBut still we would never discuss it [noise] you\nKnow so I I Want to pay a different accept at St ... saw the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called\nJust sell indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it it's great music and it's great writing [noise] um so ... there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part yeah I'm\nBlue is drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of that it was hit by a car\nI mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they had dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks I'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nOf a blue turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging his guests to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it simply read [noise]\n\nYou don't live in a really nice young man and I really wish that it was ... the thing\nWould you know the head and trying to please how was your only guys\nLittle more time to speak\nWould you know it could be has will try and explain to surgically so how was your old guys since it is and it's not like we were there was this one to do and it was a main you know I Would have been worse\nGoing soon
