{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "The failure of the world's well paid and powerful authorities and experts the bank is quoted firms central banks\nTreasuries and International Monetary fund and yes economists like me to stop the crisis will prevent the result in Europe crisis contributed to a collapse in trust this turn politics on its head\nWe cannot say the decision and taken in Nineteen Seventy five by this country and joined the common market has been was asked by this referendum to leave the EU British people have spoken and the answer is where I\nThat's the biggest political shocker in American history the idea that Donald J from a man has never been a politician who never served as a general or the army is the next president of the United states\nEmmanuel Macron will be the next president of France they say the polling projection that we have sixty five point five percent for Emmanuel Macron said he four point five percent for Marine Le pen\nI Believe the election of President Trump and president Macron and the votes for persons who leave Europe have in common a rejection of the old guard of political leaders that will juicy when the financial crisis happened\nWithin the rich countries the crisis fuel to power shift towards populist an anti authoritarian politicians and contributed to the rising resentments elites\nGlobally it accelerates with the power shifted China and Asia\nIn this program I'm going to ask whether the lessons from the financial crisis have been loans and other countries in a better prepared to meet the next one will always condemned to another crisis perhaps even more severe which would provide new fuel to the finals of populism\nIn two thousand age the world was taken by surprise will it be again\nI also Christine ... the managing director of the international Monetary Fund which is the global institution responsible for financial stability what worries her most top of the list is the populous politics of protectionism and attempts to wind back the regulations on banks\nNumber one it's the risk of inward looking policies where people are no longer prepared to share to trade to cooperate and all that together that's one the second is the risk that we feel suddenly that really improve the situation in the financial system is working well the banks are better capitalized\nThe insurance companies are operating under more stringent rules\nAnd the risk is that suddenly there is a relaxation we begin streamlining Lee begin relaxing the rules we begin lowering the threshold to begin reducing\nThe capital will begin opening up yet again the gate of creativity inventiveness applied to the financial sector which has its good but also many bad aspects to it\nFor dying coil professor of public policy at Cambridge University and a former adviser to the u._k. treasury and there's a failure of economics which I've discussed in last week's program but rather the political failure to confront the banking system which is her biggest concern\nI'm kinda worried that that could be another financial crisis and that hasn't been enough done and I certainly think it's ... of economists not analyzing it ... and I think it's a question is\nPunished ... will end confrontation that if I pass thanking set that many companies have been saying why is it that banks and a lot told less ... less money protect shelters\nAnd any other normal business went that famous race again and yet if I can I just haven't actually set set ... years old to be more liable for what happens if they could come back on that I had seen nearly enough tightening of vacation\nAnd actually in the United states now they have any other way have electing senators touched by this recognition scan\n[noise]\nThe crisis happened because I'll lead us fail to understand how globalization has created new rich [noise]\n\nHas brought more progress than any force in history\nIntegration has brought new interdependence seats and vulnerabilities [noise] the financial crisis was the first big demonstration of how integration and accelerating technological change can lead to contagion spread new risk [noise]\nThat is what I called the butterfly effect of globalization which drew was on the evidence from physics of how complex systems can have unpredictable and even chaotic outcomes [noise]\nRisk management in finance failed to take account of cross border flows and new technologies and for this reason was simply unfit\nFor purpose of the lessons being alone [noise] my fear is that while the regulators have pains to remedy the cause of the last crash is insufficient attention to news threats and particularly\nThose that may originally from outside finance\nChristina God emphasizes the need\nTo move beyond the conventional wisdom and to avoid a backward looking approach\nI passed on and said is that the next crisis comes from nowhere in other words from the place where we have no idea that it will come from\nFrom an area that we regard as safe and secure at the moment but which will suddenly and under the radar screen for a period of time suddenly blue and threaten the stability that we have and that is something which we care about and\nWe have a lot of ... alert system is that bring our research is and um you know members of stuff together you know to to try to see on days they get caught on making global landscape that we look at where something is coming out that is not going to be friendly to all of us\nThis is the reason Christine Lagarde explained to me under her watch the funders initiated working nontraditional areas such as inequality agenda and climate change\nMixed in with the driving force behind the stern report on climate change he explains why climate change is not bankers business\nThe central bank because many of the north end but many of them and some of those in leading countries have recognized that climate change is a major potential source of economic and financial instability Ifill battered by storms and hurricanes\nThat the economic instead of the major scale\nAnd we have seen these very dramatic sexist owns the hurricanes causing major economic damage in different parts of the world and boys actually seen so far is small very small relative to build the risk\nFor example the bigger I recommend Sunday that almost wrecked New York in two thousand twelve kind of be ruled out\nWith most financial centers near coasts\nExpected ocean rise in greater storms will be severely destabilizing climate change should be a global priority for many reasons box in the short term in my view a pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis and one that will woefully ill prepared for\nPeter ... the direct to the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nA condemn it could trigger a global recession it's all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent three trillion in these days\nWe know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of says really hit the GDP by about closest three percent but it was also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risk premium so that's another problem\nSo according to the the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions note in billions\n[noise]\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. before separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers a colleague of dogs with university shed independent commission banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends\nThen the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if you're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cold ring fencing so this is the idea\nThat the only high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped it was cool things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks should be in a self standing powder that bank separated
