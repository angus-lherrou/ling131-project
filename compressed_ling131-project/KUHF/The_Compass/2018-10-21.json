Israel economic society thinks the reason that economists dropped the ball was that there's some things with load\nIt's not easy to have a really slick pat I'm sets up why they didn't see it coming but one way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAsking whether they found all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know about financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into was way too they build\nModels not let one dominant notes down enough of them now they build models actually what that is that wasn't bad [noise]\nWatch all these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates unemployment [noise]\n\nOriginally there were actual mechanical models still one on display New Zealand that uses water to demonstrate how money would float around the economy as computing power has grown\nSo to as the complexity of the models which should call them is try to capture the key relationships in a set of clever equation [noise] what professor Nick stone is saying that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed\nIt would bounce back and most effect others but why would preventing models assume that the crush couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occurred with disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that look dangerous list because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation and what that meant was the boom in the past didn't seem to be with us suddenly this as his running along in a chair for way down the river a reasonable state and things are going OK\nPoliticians believe this to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue ... big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven [noise] we\nWill not return to the old boom and\nBust [noise] economists\nAre happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist is and was what my whole life in economics truth be told\nHow ... model\nOf how the economy function of how our system shouldn't um that would cost models fail at the first offense in the crisis it could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSort of course that was the same thing\nWe can and we should have happened after the Nineteen seventies\nReform written branch seems crazy now\nTo think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money in banking and explaining the ... and the economy [noise]\n\nIt wasn't the economists who are folks who the discipline of economics itself [noise]\nMy own view is that it's not economic but the economists have come to dominate the discipline [noise] they have an unhelpful obsession with perfect market ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly these high priest of the new economics\nSimply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage will collusion which one forensic to market economies [noise]\n\nThe former chief economist at one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the ...\nFact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody showed me she didn't get crisis coming not doing that I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it's coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either but my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the ride meds\nBombs that disease as being diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had ... nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to guess far too long to diagnose a disease and respond to the ... the ... there was a school of economics so that could do that how it out of the crisis was old fashioned games in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point then people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession they weren't using frontier economics with the guy that got stolen graduate schools\nThey were using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so did he can under the searches that rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early ... says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close ... there was seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very ...\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on we're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that knocks off is\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession had become windy colon is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we should really important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in\nTwo thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this it was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world and has that changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the court charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum being [noise]\nIn finance in so many other areas the
