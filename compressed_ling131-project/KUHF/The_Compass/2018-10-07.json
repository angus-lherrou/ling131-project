{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "This week we're going to folks and the response to the crisis and ask if the way that governments handled it make things better or worse [noise]\nThey're not saying he hunting [noise]\nIn the u._s. it's estimated that the crisis cost at least twenty thousand dollars for each person and\nOvertime results in the loss of Fifteen billion dollars of national wealth equivalent to almost one year's economic activity the greatest pain as being felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market\nJeff Smith executive director of Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis and the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started to most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration\nOf subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to foreclosure you had a lot of vacant abandoned meant in those neighborhoods and it was really concentrated in a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis that house itself\nWas likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value the property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI also Jeff what happened to these people foreclosure\nIs a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very significant numbers of these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car for a mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job easy if you can get a apartments so the big events that hill a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed homeownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings\nHomeownership rates will be under forty five steps that sharply since the crash over forty percent of housing wealth is now held by the over sixties compared to own your ... before the crash poor and middle income families and young people have not benefited from the increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for certain components of the economy has improved and you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is continuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered\nFrom the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments that families who live there struggle for finding employment and Ford will housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago and he I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources are getting better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\nThe growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and moved the dynamic cities with a new jobs ought to be found combined with the\nFact that the U.S government spends one six of the average of other advanced countries on labor market retraining has reduced ability of people to escape their predicament\n\nBetween Nineteen Seventy in two thousand new eleven hundred and forty seven countries experience banking crises two thousand age was the mother of all crises in the severity and globally impacts averaging comes in the rich world which the grunt uninterrupted since the second world will fail\nThe U.S economy was within three is about a third smaller than it would have been had they not be in a crisis this was despite the\nFact that the U.S in boxing the stimulation package\nWhich sought to minimize the impact professor Joe Stiglitz was received the Nobel Prize for economics explains the reasons\nA economy is hit by a crisis economy goes down ... revenues go down often expenditures have to go out for unemployment welfare benefits\nAnd so even countries with surpluses wind up having deaths of six and even more do you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks\nHistorically there have been many instances where government and seeing that deficit say that deficit will result in a loss of confidence we have to get rid of the deficit the way you get rid of the deficit is cut back\nA hundred years which is called us therapy for raise taxes but actually really hard to do the middle of a downturn Herbert Hoover who was the president when the stock market collapsed in Nineteen twenty nine used austerity and I credit him with converting the stock market crash into the great depression\nThe Obama administration had learned the lesson that the renowned British economist John Maynard Keynes drew from the great depression sooner after Obama became president in early two thousand nine Congress approved the seven hundred and eighty seven billion dollar American recovery and reinvestment act\nWhich aims to spur consumer spending and restore investor confidence through a combination of tax credits increases in welfare payments and cheap loans for businesses\nIn addition the Federal Reserve pumping money into the economy to reduce interest rates and then an experiment known as quantitative easing that also was adopted in the u._k. and Europe\nIn the U.S over four trillion dollars was added to the money supply in this way and then you can Europe at least ... trillion\nCanes great work address the question was should have been done and the answer is not austerity but stimulation\nWhat happens in an economic downturn is people get fearful their spending and except vicious cycle is that now spend the economy gets weaker and austerity is a downward spiral\nIn Nineteen fifty nine governments acted like people and when times got tough they reduce spending but while it's rational for people to tighten their belts in tough economic times came showed that if governments did the same they would make\nMatches far worse\nAnd governments need to overcome fear an economic contracts and by spending to reignite demand\n\nIn Europe and the u._k. like in the U. S. canes approach also was adopted first and when the G twenty finance ministers were convened by the vent prime minister Gordon Brown in April two thousand nine degree to one trillion dollar stimulation package\nAnd the European Commission agreed additional spending of over two hundred billion euros [noise]\nThe Nineteen countries to show the single European currency the euro soon with forced to reverse course [noise]\nPuffs killing me the ... e commissioner identifies the contagion that led to the wall street panic spreading to Europe\nThe level of dancing many European countries all of a sudden look too high\nThe euro crises was a consequence of the U.S a crisis and\nThe roots of the euro crisis was that the EU financial system\nHas a quarter of a sovereign holding a sovereign bonds probably debt them and that the quality of the subject that was hit by the crisis not least because of repeated rise of indebtedness of European countries on stage in order\nTo bump into the economy which was the ... and to be expected reaction now\nFive eurozone countries cypress Greece Ireland Portugal and Spain had to go begging bowl in hand the IMF and European Central bank which imposed further cuts to bring national income in line with expenditure\nThe result was that Europe experienced a double whammy hit first by the collapse of the financial system of contagion spread from the U.S and then my self imposed austerity\nThe moment banks stopped to face you know the Republicans ... in the financial system and given the huge amount of cross holding in the financial system so that triggered him a financial crisis in Europe and the experience showed that the way the you had been buried the euro house\nWas not ... enough to whether a such a shock and this had to be dollar during the crisis\nEurope's crisis was Bruce all your area economic activity fell by roughly one point four trillion euros that's about the size of the entire economies of Spain and the Netherlands\nFinland Portugal Spain Italy and Greece have yet to reach the levels of economic activity they had ten years ago", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Compass", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
