Bush walk and and and I thought it was very excited\nTo have this of course why that by the electorate can make the ... electric prevents aid kit that side of the world for drugs that they brought up but not every country is that\nLook at the same time well you know the nature of the world's output is represented industrial mandate that come up with some added that\nMixed and is a former chief economist of the world bank he explained why mastered so much to include the previously ... countries\nYou used to get the latest meetings oriented around the seven and they used in fighting leaders of other countries so you get you know the second most important country and the well by population India and the most important country in the world but population China [noise]\nInvited along they might sit outside and wait and then be invited into they can affect them and they ride he felt that this was upset and they just something they said they did feel that way you not to stand\nWhere they were coming from but that changed with the crisis so the crisis itself\nBrought a big expansion in the latest meetings\nBecause the countries of the world in particular rich countries in this case\nRealize they couldn't do it alone that the emerging market and developing countries economists were already close to half the world's economy class of ... and then come and you couldn't try and handle the crisis with that amount of the economy outside the room\nSo it really did change and that was a very significant thing I think and in retrospect\nBehind the scenes to countries were forced to work together more closely to stitch financial regulations into place to try and limit the damage the crisis was doing\nThe G twin the heads of state put together coordinated plan to stimulate their economies in order to help prevent a worldwide depression but despite these initially improvements in financial corporation the other early signs that were less hopeful\n[noise]\nUm\nIt became obvious that the focus of politicians are mounting national problems come at the expense of vital global commitment international effort on all sorts of friends from aid to the environment undermined the urgent replaces the important [noise]\n\nBack in the year two thousand I was at the millennium ... hundred and eighty nine countries agreed to the millennium development goals series of commitments to reduce world poverty over the next Fifteen Years ... was leading advisor to the United nations are meeting these goals\nHe was frustrated at how the financial crisis undermined development post two\nEight was the middle of the so called Millennium Development goal Fifteen year period\nI was the special advisor to the secretary general of the un first Kofi Annan on ... on these Millennium Development goals and when the financial crisis came the attention\nWhich was not all that strong to begin with on these goals basically disappeared the funding was frozen important institutions like the global fund to fight aids TB and malaria actually skipped funding rounds because the\nDonor countries so called war donating so the recipient countries couldn't get the funds for aids treatment or malaria or other urgent matters and this is the kind of spill over that was really rife throughout the whole world\n... now the head of Amnesty International back in two thousand nine he was executive director of Greenpeace and came smack up against a similar issue as he said at the time the financial crisis was the final boots and this other place of negotiations to stop climate change I asked him to explain what he meant by that\nThe financial crisis was also happening at a time when some off us naively believed that our politicians address this heightened so that was coming out of the climate community and we were getting up\nThe Copenhagen climate summit way we were hoping to get what we called\nDeal another fabulous field but it fit ambitious and binding deal and in reality has the world knows we go to flab outcome full of loopholes that bull\nThere's no question that the financial crisis puts a damper on the possible outcomes in\nVery important in Copenhagen climate summit in two thousand nine and I would argue that one of the reasons given often was\nEven behind the scenes that discussions with political leaders especially from the so called developed countries was that you know we can deal with this right now because of the Financial Times says we have to recover and so on and we would\nSuccessfully agree that a crisis\nActually is a moment of opportunity let's look at how we can redesign certain things that we take for granted and so on\nFar from the crisis leading to a greater collaboration is given rise to nationalism in protectionism and severely undermined cooperation between the advanced countries and between them and the rest of the world\nThis was immediately evidence in lower commitments to a than to stop and climate change more recently the U.S you and China have entered the trade will the G twenty has become yet another talking shrimp and the G. S. has been overwhelmed by acrimony even the nature of military lines is being threatened by a leading member of the usa\nAnd the u._k. has decided to withdraw from the European Union\nThe tragic irony of the crisis is at the usa you can Europe could have avoided it but failed to listen to their own sermons regarding financial management\nThe rich countries had repeatedly preach the virtues of keeping economies and the banking sector under control the rich countries where where of just how costly financial crises where they'd seen poorer countries suffer when things went wrong and they'd seen those stereotypes that follows a bailout from the international community [noise]\nHowever that politicians in experts were loaded into complacency but years apparently benign growth and sadly decided to ignore their own some [noise]\nMartin Wolf the chief economics commentator the Financial Times explains how this meant well richer countries crashed developing countries came in to the economic ascendancy\nSince the crisis the growth of the developed countries and I got to be very very ... it will be wrong to say was the last decade for the developed world as a whole but except in the west decay since the ... and the output per head\nOf most developed countries as badly ... since two thousand and ...\nMaybe a few percentage but not much more there are some relatives successes like Germany or among the big developed countries bought quite a few that have shrunk gray case so they stagnate teach meanwhile the economies of China India\nA few others but those are the most important cases have grown absolutely enormously\nHow did some Asian countries managed to succeed won a large proportion of the global economy wasn't meltdown ... bunny was dean of the week when you school of public policy at the University of Singapore He says it was a case of elation\n... own trauma\nAlmost exactly ten years earlier in the Nineteen Ninety seven Asian financial crisis and that was that you know associating experience for many Asian countries and the lessons they learned from that ... castle\nOr make sure you're not too highly in debt that you make sure that yourself or lion and that you don't ever have to sort of depend on next Senate rescue package\nTo a save you and so as a result of that crisis that level of debt in most Asian countries went down and they were they pulled in and castle in the economic management\nAnd that's why it's actually quite stunning how most of the Asian countries except for half a South Korea sailed through the global financial crisis quite well", "show_name": "The Compass", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "11"}
