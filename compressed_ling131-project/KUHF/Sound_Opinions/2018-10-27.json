Democrats and fifty two Republicans basically we've we've determined if every woman who's currently leading into districts were to end up winning there'll be a hundred women in the house and twenty four in the Senate\nAnd that is an increase from the current count which is a hundred and seven total women in Congress but I think we also have to know that some of those women will lose their races and so the percentage of women\nHolding seats in Congress might actually not change all that much\nOn the other hand a lot of these women who were running in primaries in particular because of this anti Trump sentiment that was sweeping the country were first time candidates right and what we do know is that the more comfortable that people get within the political system maybe the more likely they are\nTo do better the next time so\nWhile they might have lost it this primary they might have a better grasp of local donors in their district who to go to and hire the next time they run a

perhaps trying to keep an arm's length distance from Trump is because there are certain traditional constituencies that are turned off by the president said college educated white women\nWho might be a sort of potable entity for Democrats so the thing that people should keep in mind is is mid term elections even if the president isn't coming up and every single commercial that you see on TV that's a political ad\nVoters are inherently thinking about what is going on in the White House in every election not just the Trump's election and you react to it and you say oh I like this guy and I like his party or I don't like this guy and I don't like his party and that might influence your vote\nElephant in the room when my sir yes here's somebody else one might say\nThis November election is

from a lecture and really the most important election of all five\nSo your numbers suggest a turnout that reflect the most important election of electrons\nYou're seeing pretty enthusiastic numbers from people saying yes I'm very pumped to vote pumps to turn out\nAnd I think particularly on the Democratic side and certain races they're hoping that democratic turnout what kind of push them over

legally belong to then known as the state ...\nMillion more to the United Arab Emirates to Palestine but it isn't new tell me about not just stateless this passport Les Mis\nOften these kinds of problems arise when there's major political upheaval so World War one is a key moment in the sense that there's the collapse of these European land empires the Russian Empire under the pressure of the Bolshevik Revolution the Ottoman Empire and the Austrian\nEmpire and all of a sudden all these people are kind of set adrift and they don't necessarily have the documents that they now need in order to enter some other state\nIn those days there was the league of nations that basically decided to give the authority to a man named free just announced it and it was a Norwegian explorer and humanitarian\nHe was named to the league of nations high commissioner for Russian refugees\nAnd because this was such a widespread problem he was given the authority to issue a document in his own name was called demands and passport\nSo that people would have the kind of documents that they need and subsequently the un has done the same kind of thing issued papers to people in need them\nIt's clearly been recognized especially since World War one that state listen this is a condition of considerable vulnerability and if you lack the documents you need a corresponding to state listening that makes your situation that much more difficult\nIt's been an issue in the United states at the U.S Mexico border\nAnd immigration has his time on us citizens department reporting on resulting

was some doubt that they were actually born in the United states and that there were falsified occasions of\nVerse documents by mid wives who were involved in the birth of those people I mean the basic underlying issues are these people citizens that is where they really born on the territory of the United states which you know in our law accords them citizenship\nWhatever the circumstances were of a false vacation of papers by midwives or not\nSuddenly these people have no access to a passport they haven't got a Mexican passport and therefore are they even though they were most likely born within our borders some sort of undefined to other\n[noise] this is why in a way I got interested in this whole phenomenon of passports were not born with our citizenship stamped on her forehead it can only really be made effect is\nWith these kinds of documents so if they can't get access to the documents they are indeed in a difficult legal limbo\nI mean the United states has also particularly in mid twentieth century denied passports to people on political ground I mean very frequently denied passports to people who were\nMembers of the Communist Party thought to be connected to the Communist Party et cetera et cetera\nNow it's utterly un surprising that the passport has become apart from the means of documentation proof of origin and everything else a commodity\nIt's a hot ticket for a variety of reasons including as it turns out countries themselves that want to deal with the population that they don't want to make four members of the society\nSelling of citizenship is something that's been taking off certain countries in the Mediterranean and Cyprus in Malta and other countries [noise] they're taking in people who are basically buying citizenship who are making a contribution of some sort\nOf how much does it costs to go to ... hundred thousand dollars you have to come and live in Dominique no no you don't you don't even have to come to them to get the get the citizenship you pay the money from wherever you are sort of mail order citizenship sort of something like that so as a passport\nBecomes more of a commodity whether by individuals

get you into lots of countries without a visa\nAnd if you're from Nigeria or Senegal your passport doesn't open this many visa free doors [noise] I think the market that we're talking about just
