yourself a civility skeptic yeah I saw routinely\nHow charges of incivility were used as ways to stifle debate and that civility was very often a tool of marginalizing the marginal in suppressing dissent\nAnd then you discovered someone who changed her mind Roger Williams a radical puritan and founder of Rhode Island he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay colony basically for refusing to shut up that's exactly\nRight he's an uncompromising puritan English Calvinist and on his own terms most of the Puritans and Massachusetts Bay were not Christians at all they were sinners\nAnd he thinks that his duty to tell them that at every opportunity he's a really difficult intolerant puritan so I assume that Rhode Island was and in tolerant place\nThat is the assumption that we would tend to make but exactly the opposite happens when Roger Williams is banished from Massachusetts Bay and she found the town of Providence on a gift of land from the Narragansett try with what she was very friendly\nHe opens it up\nFor other religious dissenters who've been banished from the colonies to come and worship freely why [laughter] right I mean Williams's idea was that in order to have spiritual or religious purity\nYou were going to have to have an absolute wall of separation between church and state and between civil society and religious society\nSo Rhode Island becomes the first society in the world not to have an established church so who live there I mean what sort of dissenters descended on Rhode Island\nRhode Island became known as a robes island and the latrine of New England because he's a basically everyone who was to Wilder uncivil to be tolerated and the other colonies and found themselves they're\nSo Catholics Jews and then also pagan or American Indians\nBut what's really exceptional here and where he goes farther than anyone else really and I think further than even people like Jefferson is that Williams thinks that not only do all these erroneous doctrines all these erroneous conscience as hot this right to live together and civil society\nThey all also have a right into duty\nTo avenge allies for their errors [laughter]\nEveryone has to be incredibly annoying is what you're saying [laughter] and it's not all the time it's not twenty four seven although Williams himself seemed to have a quite a lot of stamina but it's the idea that part of what it is to live in the world\nIs to have the courage of one's convictions and to care for the soles of one's fellow citizens and if you think you're right\nThen you have a duty to try to convince others that they're wrong politely it's not that you have to be polite indeed this kind of no holds barred evangelical debate is going to be the cause of a lot of offense\nI I think you know one thing I think Williams would want us to think about is why we set the standard for success so high\nNaturally and murderous coexistence in health is a precious achievement and if we keep on making the best the enemy of the good in social life\nThan we really do risk losing these ...\nThis programming is brought to you by the region at school and independent Catholic school were boys they're

hours and these volumes Churchill at the center of the war [noise]\nWhereas historians have filled out some of the detail which is that it was the Soviets who defeated the Nazis and the Americans who defeated the Japanese\nAnd that was not his first go at writing history or autobiography because when his political career was in shards after the first World War he wrote a history them as well\nHe
