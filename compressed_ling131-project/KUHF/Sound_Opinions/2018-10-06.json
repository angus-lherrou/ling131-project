things are arranged such that in any situation that involves a man and a woman alone the woman absorbs one hundred percent of the risk to her physical safety and to her reputation and his shoulders none\nOf course they're going to be extremely upset\nFor men to have to shoulder any amount of risk under those circumstances becomes intolerable there just dresses real one of the things that really struck me during the hearing was how angry circulated in that room and how the one person not permitted to express any was Christine Blasey Ford\nThe theatrics that the GOP demonstrated in the second half of that hearing involved a lot of grabbing the anger ball so to speak and just out screaming you know what it\nReminded me of in basketball there's this thing that players do sometimes called flopping their touched by another player and then they fall hard on the floor hoping that the ...\n[laughter]\nThat's so good yeah that is a strategic performance that cannot be honored and I think that the me too movement has unleashed a lot of anger that has never been permitted to be expressed or felt [noise]\n\nAnd I think that that is a pretty potent tool and honestly I think it's actually very healthy for people who has been repressing and bottling up their anger into a socially acceptable performance for as long as they has been feeling it can be able to finally express it\nSo you're talking about democratic women or Lindsey Graham I'm Talking\nAbout democratic women I think than the Graham has been expressing just fine [laughter] I think he's okay [laughter]\nBut when I see that a man is very angry it's a very instinctive reaction I'm a little bit afraid and I think to myself oh well he must be right in some way I should retreat a little bit and give ground that I find myself no longer being very impressed by I think I'm not alone\nThe intimidating function that male anger used to serve I think is wearing thin [noise]\nThank you very much thanks for having me\nLiterally Lewis borough is a staff writer for slate\n\n[noise] coming up the best seller\nShooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men

you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow\nIt up with one more wrong and wipe these on paying ... and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything that had come before [noise]\nNow what most Americans know about the ... car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven [noise] talking about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic vary by heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other one\nAt five hundred years of colonialism and what it had done to us and how it had made the country\nAnd so when the Spanish government decided in conjunction with the American government that they were going to send some replicas of that Nina pinto in Santa Maria across the ocean that around the United states it's pretty tone deaf on the part of the Spanish government if yeah if you don't mind me saying like living in these ships\nTo the places where they introduced slavery to native populations in the modern populations descended from the slaves that were owned by Columbus and his brother for instance\nThey were rebuffed it just fizzles\nIn the mean time our government was planning a\nClinton sing tenor apes you believe to take off Nineteen Ninety two yeah with its own replicas of the three boats sailing under the Golden Gate bridge but corporate sponsors retreated right the jubilee never happen\nExactly because American indian activists in American indian people just said enough with this Columbus crap we're not going to sit by and let you do this\nAnd by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had generations of native people complaining high school and going to college and serving in the army and serving in World War one and World War two in Korea and Vietnam by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had native veterans coming back from the first Gulf War for that matter enough with this\nSo now the state of Alaska and\nHawaii Oregon South Dakota and Vermont don't recognize Columbus Day there are cities Austin, Texas Salt Lake city Los Angeles uh Minneapolis Seattle they celebrate indigenous people's day\nHas a ways to go but we've come a long ways\nSo why don't we jumped ahead the Standing Rock okay you take issue with a popular narrative that was used by the former chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the author of a New York times op ed\nWho had the treatment of Indian protesters and the Bundy bothers the protesters who sees the my lord National Wildlife\nRefuge in Oregon he wrote on the same day that the armed Malory militants were acquitted I watched as riot police were military grade weapons rounded up hundreds of peaceful water protectors in North Dakota\nProtesting an oil pipeline the juxtaposition of these two events one system of justice for self styled white cowboys and another for Indians was stunning\nI don't buy it this is a crucial difference that German Archambault was missing here the\nWhite supremacist wherever you might call them that at the allure refuge there occupying federal and\nThe water protectors at Standing Rock were being arrested for trespassing on private land\nThe issue wasn't that why people are being treated differently than Indians I think to maintain that kind of us them Indian white cowboys and Indians discourse is to miss the larger point that the federal government privileges private property above all most everything else that's the problem\nBut weren't the protesters at Standing Rock trying to protect what would ultimately be damage to their own land\nWell of course but the problem was that Ninety percent of the pipeline was routed\nThrough private lands there were ways to rewrite it away from you you can meet with the pipeline and meet with the Army Corps of engineers as many tribes on the pipeline's route did and subsequently the pipeline was re routed around those communities but Standing Rock missed meeting after meeting\nNegotiation of negotiation deadline up to a deadline until the government finally without their input approve the pipeline under the lake and very close to the Standing Rock\nWhat you're saying is that this us versus them mentality was huge missed opportunity\nOriginal sin is that the government broke it's treaty obligations and promises to the Standing Rock and other Lakota tribes which resulted in opening up Lakota land to private non native ownership that's what allowed the pipeline to go through because our government will bend over backwards for private enterprise to me this is the story\nOf local communities against capitalism not cowboys versus Indians\nBut I'm Sorry but we already know that story where you know what happens to Indian sort of were sealing our own faith let's face it you know part of the problem is an Iraq was that the government didn't show up for meetings\nYou know I think it's really important that are activists put their bodies on the line but I think it's also important that our elected travel officials should put their bodies and chairs and short for meetings don't get me wrong Standing Rock was amazing and important and powerful\nWhat was amazing about that protest was that they issued figure heads and I would say chauvinist sexist violent leadership like we saw in past iterations of Indian activism at wounded knee\nWe had a collection of the diaspora that was coming to the defense of Standing Rock it was powerful and important and the legacy of that protest will live on immediately after the protests was over at Standing Rock\nThe question of pipelines came up on my reservation my reservation council had previously approved pipelines through the reservation after Standing Rock there is no way they could possibly hope to be reelected if they approved more pipeline leases so it had immediate effect around the country\nAnd this was the result of healthy positive kind of activism the likes of which we had not seen before\nSo what is the narrative you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds\nI Want it once and for all destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world enter a serpent in fourteen Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us Indian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and\nI think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you
