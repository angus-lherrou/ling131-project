response to legal action ... by environmental groups\nThe additives can be used in a range of foods from ice cream to baked goods to gum they infused with cinnamon meant and other flavors you would not know if they're in the food you buy because food manufacturers are allowed to label them simply as artificial or natural ingredients\nBob ... was one of the government's cheese graders he spent Thirty years testing and tasting cheese for the United states government yes this is a real job it sounds amazing are you pretty annoying to eat cheese with like are you the most picky cheese eater in your group of friends\nI Am absolutely not I owe any cheese in fact if you've seen my ship you would know that I eat enough to keep the little\nBugs job was to make sure that all of that she's met USDA grade aged cheddar standard the right choice to level the proper shade of yellowish orange to correct flavor profile\nSo if you wanted to sell choose to the government Bob would show up with this like hollow rod called E. cheese trier\nAnd you inserted into the block or the barrel or whatever when you turn it and you pull out a quarter of cheese the core sample of cheese yeah ooh and that's what you great and uh they're Seventeen flavor defects that could happen to him cheddar cheese I can tell you what we had to reject it for a flat bitter use the mall be old milk Rudy\nRudy gray it tastes like apple that sounds lovely you don't want that nope metallic sour ... onion Barney ... sulfide and you can taste all of those things in a piece of cheese you betcha\nBob says the number one flavor defects he had to look out for was acidity a teeny bit was allowed but not too much\nAnyway the government had its plan in place it was ready to start buying cheese and it took a few years but a flood of she starts to come in\nSo much cheese that Bob starts having to spend more and more time on the road because he has to actually go to the cheese degrade it\nHe and his colleagues or drowning in cheese and they go to their bosses know like we need more cheese graders and so they tried to hire more cheese graders\nI traveled thirty nine states and I was gone as long as ten weeks at a time doing that so getting people to do it was always a challenge the young people do they see well I Can't go out with a girl or a gang go with a guy because I'm On the road all the time who's got time for data when you're traveling around eating cheese everywhere now I think she's eating as better than dating sometime\nI don't disagree with you I don't disagree with you\nMore graders grading more cheese that the government then by is\nBut then we had the issue was storing stuff I mean every warehouse in Wisconsin was full all our area around your everybody had she's even the beverage distributors they head cheese in storage I mean we'd have cheese in every coal storage and the United states including the caves in Kansas that were full of that stuff\nThe caves in Kansas yeah the underground caves the government of the United states of America had caves full of cheddar cheese\nAnd when news gets out that the government is filling a cave with cheese the press goes nuts because this is exactly what people think of when they think of a government program gone awry like this is the original bridge to nowhere\nTo secede cave full of cheese in Kansas City\nIn connection with like to welcome you went a little\nI had to kind of had to of course you did\nOh I Am currently about thirty five feet underground in an old converted limestone mine that is the size of one hundred and twenty football fields\nShe that's pretty good\nYou don't do that huh I'm never thought about yeah probably gets old this is Dan Callahan he's been working here since the Nineteen seventies since the cheese debacle and he tells me these were never government owned caves but one day government rented out a ton of Cape space\nAnd then cheddar cheese started to show up massive blocks of the stuff palate after pallet in fact he remembers the exact room it went into [noise]\nWe walk inside there's massive columns and it looks like something the lord of the rings towards building and it is also very\nGood for the government she's there'd be a way to see how high so you'd be Seventeen sixteen the dentist the cheese took up about half an acre of things are just wall to wall\nFloor to ceiling and then as you can't fill in that you just work your way right back out and so there was no more room for you to be in this room right\nBy the early Nineteen eighties the dairy support program was costing taxpayers around two billion dollars a year\nThe government was buying one in every four pounds of the country's cheddar cheese they actually had to rent out space in multiple caves at one point the government was storing two pounds of cheese for every single American citizen\nBy this point Jimmy Carter was out of office and the Ronald Reagan team was stuck dealing with these ... cheese and not all of it with aging well there was an incredible press conference where agriculture Secretary John block went before reporters and held up a giant hunk of cheese like it was a national emergency\nYou see that take a cheese we've got sixty million of these\nGovernment owns with mold\nIs deteriorating we can't find a market for\nFinding a market for this stuff is in fact a pretty fascinating puzzle because getting rid of government surplus anything is an economically tricky thing\nExactly so the thing that the government was concerned about is what's called commercial displacement\nAgain economist Andy ... Fitch and he says the government could not just released a flood of surplus cheese onto the market because it would crush she's producers you can imagine the the the cheese\nHe lives in the business selling shoes is going to say what's the deal here you took away my customers is you know important to me\nSo that leaves a couple of options you could destroy the surplus but that looks pretty bad\nOr you can try to get your surplus goods to people who were not going to buy it anyway and that you won't be flooding anyone's markets\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or Sawyer even powdered milk we can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid but she's\nJust doesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese the way through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which\nOne you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like brick\nAnd this is what people will remember as government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage one is amazing style massive crowds of people being\nHanded ranks of cheese and at times with the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black\nUSDA stance on it and he's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that governments she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the cave full of the staff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise]\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live Matt fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nGovernment cheese and\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nWe bought we get we get a like a lot of them was something she\nMay be government she says most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with the\n[laughter] government cheese\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a BRCA Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to not run on valve either but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nPeople got a ten speed bike and they got ... when I never got a ...\nAnd ... you want it to be a kind of person who could buy that stuff one day\nI did I always did you always wanted to fly first class you know\nLike I'd be riding in coach [laughter]\nYou know I was like get me in the front of this plane\nHow'd you how'd you end up working at a shoe store at age six\nAs I work in a shoe stores in high school you know the neighborhood sort of cool shoe store the old the guy that started the store or went to high school with my brother John so it was a job that wasn't like hey I Want to go work and she was it was just a job sort of fell into it yeah\nBut I fell in love with it right away what did you fall in love with so it's hard to explain but at that moment in the shoe business you know it was a very exciting time because this is like the ... early to mid seventies yeah like Seventy four ... before I even started platform shoes were very big ...\nFor men ... time in his shoe bright right ... yeah and so it was just very interesting\nYou know I was into it I was into the the creative sort of\n... of the whole thing what do you remember about\nWorking in that store\nI remember working very hard very motivated even in a young age\nAnd what's that mean when you were there was were you thinking she is this is me this is my calling or where he was more like I like selling stuff\nI Love selling stuff he did I Do but I also like creating stuff yeah and I like creating stuff to sell\nThe New York in the shoe store and and I guess at a certain point you go to to the city to New York city\nTo ... well the guy that on the loose Lance opened up a wholesale company called the L. J. Simone and he calls you out of the blue yes pretty much yeah and he says come to work\nI'm self [noise] so that's what I did like a little wholesale company yeah and what happened was I went to work there and we blew it out man well how did you blow it up you know I went to work for them and it was like boom we made it nice company out of it\nAnd where he was sourcing issues from shoe factories and then\nWhat yeah he was designing the shoes and I was selling\nAnd what's at that point where you you start to think about maybe doing this for yourself or did you think this is great I'm gonna keep America this is just ride the train\nYou know at some point I thought about doing it for myself that I was very happy there\nMhm you know but at some point I thought you know I could do this and so what happened and why did you leave\nYou know I had taken it as far as I could take it and um I just didn't want to have a boss anymore it was just time you know ready for me to show that chart my own course and that was like thirty you associate with that for a long time yeah I was actually there when he won\nThis was also I mean it's kind of a wild time right I mean you were drinking heavily you were I\nWas a started using drugs and drinking I was pretty much pretty neat prevented most in my twenties\nSay with alcoholics hits bottom you know they keep this another level of bottom to go so yeah it was pretty bad\nHow bad it again well you know\nI can tell you a lot of stories about it um [noise] basically I couldn't stop and you know it was embarrassing myself and it was starting to affect my work and a\nHalf to stop\nOr die was that bad yeah ... drugs and drank yes\nCocaine everything and uh\nI Would work you know it when I worked at work work work and then get stone every night you know hammered\nBecause you were working so hard it was just like the thing you did you just\nYeah you thought you deserved it or you could justify some\n\nBut uh I was a mess was ...\nWhen when did you how did you how did you get out of that\nI had some friends you know that pointed me towards a place where I could get so\nDid you go to a and that you go to the clinic and\nI did I went to and it helped it saved my life wow yeah\n\nSo I I'm assuming it was after you he recovered that that you started Steve Madden\nYeah I was sober when I started Steve not I mean it was just a miracle you know I started I got sober I started this company and\nYou know my life completely changed and what was that ... was the idea was the first idea the idea was to basically do the same thing design and sell your is exactly the same idea and what was your first year my first shoe was a clog\nWas a back was clog and um how many did you make\nSo you know the way it was you know we made we made some shoes and you know we just got this fabulous reaction but nothing\nThe people I thought I was going to get a reaction from which would my contemporaries which was from the younger kids that were like the phone was ringing like where do you get that shoe and all that stuff so we knew that something was going on here so that's the track that we went on\n[noise] All right so you've got this pretty good business going and year one what are you thinking thinking okay I mean did you have ambitions at that point all ready to make this into something Joe\nSo when I'm mad as I started the business and you know I'm just not really don't have much money I'm just sort of working hand to mouth and a friend of mine who I grew up with went to work for this brokerage firm and they were raising money for small companies\nIs is Donny poor Danny ... yeah and uh you know we're going to raise you were going to get you\n... six hundred grand and to and he said to you hey you need to expand your line really talented I've known you my whole life you know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know ... thousand was like six hundred million to me yeah\nAnd then he said well not only will I get your six hundred grand but I'm going to get your six million dollars when I take your\nPublic and I laugh get him you know because I probably had thirty thousand dollars in my arms and my ...\nAnd so of course you're like what thirty three thirty to something like that yeah and you're thinking we could raise me six hundred thousand bucks that's right so so so so Danny or help you go yeah and he helped me go public in his sperm\nWas called strap no mine a very famous St for anybody who's seen the wolf of Wall Street yeah\nShe's pretty good movie actually my name\nIs Jordan fell for the year I turned twenty six I mean forty nine million dollars would piss me off because it was three five million a week [noise]\nI should explain spreading oh come on I was just like ... and dump for yeah they used to call them ... and they were basically hell they would sell really crappy companies they would ... get the sacrifice jacked up later sell all the shares make tons of money that I Would lose their stress and so they basically were\nWanting to do this with Steve Martin right they want it to do it Steve managers of the perfect guy for them because because you don't have a company and it was small and they could do their thing with it you know it fit the profile\n[noise]\nFor those you don't know me ah\nMy name's Steve Martin and we know you are [laughter]\n[noise] so that scene and\nWith me talking in front of the ... it was very accurate we should explain the sea of people haven't seen it you you go up in front of all these um these traders in the ... yeah I started talking about my shoes thinking that they would\nReally be interested but they really weren't I was just a piece of it was just a piece of paper and a piece of meat that they could salad you really\nWant to just to digress for [noise] because [noise] the people\nOf this fighting entrepreneurs [noise] I'm not one of those entrepreneur is that that thought he was going to be super successful you know I was just trying to survive and I'm very negative very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the shows yet total I'm sure they got that you know they're they're going to be I can give me down to me I think I'm going out of business every other day\nTo the strength in sales go the company goes public ... public yeah all of a sudden it raises how much money for you I think the public offering\nWas about seven million bucks wow so are we use it I I took it and then very short period of time from a half a million bucks I was doing forty million a year fifty million and and what did that really there within thirty six months incredible so okay you get all this cash from from the initial public\nOffering you a ... and in fact plenty to chew ask any questions I mean these guys were uh they were totally breaking the law I mean there at that point they were artificially inflate in your stocks did you\nLike were you suspicious at all about Danny and about Stratton I mean did you did you think hey you know these guys do it\nAll I knew it was too good to be true yeah I knew\nSo I was greedy and foolish\nYes I'm trying to
