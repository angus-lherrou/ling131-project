about a library were partly because oh it's so exciting there's so much great stuff here\nBut some of it was being in a place that I share with other people and we're all looking for what ever is that we're interested in at that moment and there's something wonderful about that\nThere is also a lot of stuff that is not on line and that is going to remain true probably for eternity\nAnd it to the original co working space too\nThat was the one of the things that I realized there was a period of time when I was working on the book and I just couldn't work at home anymore so I rented space in a

Jackson [noise] whatever [noise]\nGo by the way I don't know [noise]\n\nKenny has left the studio we assume to go watch the negotiator the Nineteen Ninety eight movie by Samuel Jackson and in the studio now is Sarah Gonzalez hey Sarah how Nick you're tweak is about the wedding industrial complex and we gave you this assignment because you're about to get married congratulations\nThanks and might tweak comes from Damon Jones he's an economist at the University of Chicago and ... year planning a wedding right now right\nI just recently was married in June\nYou'd just oh so you're you're in the clear\nI Am in clear but I Do have to write thank you notes or you behind schedule apparently you have up to a year to send out thank you notes yeah who makes these rules and that the timeframe down from the wedding God's I don't know that I Would call them the gods it would be like the way wedding gremlin yeah yeah\nThey mind sweet cats to do with the way we think about wedding registries\nI hate wedding registries everyone hates them yes it feels like the sideways way of asking people to reimburse you for like their dinner in their booze\nYeah and the mine also says that you can't even ask for what you really want to earn a wedding registry because it's just a little tacky\nThere's some gifts that are not acceptable to ask for you know can you give me season tickets to the Knicks but for some reason plates and forks are acceptable um we have enough place we have enough forks we don't need any more of those\nI feel I'm here on the force in places like maybe that made sense when those things were handmade in Pennsylvania but like this stuff is getting cheaper and cheaper\nYeah and throwing a wedding is getting more and more expensive so here is ... ...\nI say let's discard the registry and maybe it does have some tickets good old fashioned tickets for the wedding\nWeights we sell people take it to ten year wedding\nOkay we wouldn't use the word so that might be a ... popular ...\nInstead of a wedding registry so like don't buy me a gift just pay for your plate of food at the wedding\nDon't buy gift just help us to to have the best wedding\nEver you want to you have to writing gift you may want to charge different prices okay so no\nLess prizes are different people okay so flat prices easiest but it's not fair\nLike maybe you want to cut your undergrad college cuts in a break but your investment banker friend she's painful price this\nGuy is cold and calculating and I kinda liked it he's\nAn economist [laughter]\nBut here I mapped you have plus ones okay oh the last one to ... wearing yes yes so the issue\nIs you have a really good friend that you want to invite tier wedding but ah they have a new boyfriend or girlfriend and that you don't know they you know and now you have to spend like about three hundred person for their food their booze their chair their table their fork\nYet and if you have to pay for your new girlfriend's ticket maybe she doesn't have to come after\nOh maybe she's not going to you anymore and there's another big benefit no shows\nCan you believe that you're going to go through this entire process and only to have someone maybe not show up\nNow don't tell me wedding okay so I understand that it's a risk I'm taking\nYeah so why not share the risk you have a deposit that's none refundable and your ticket and if you just sign up to show we understand and we also appreciate that your deposit is going toward the food that's ...\nSitting there cold and an eating at the wedding\nOkay so you're getting married in about a month are you going to take Damon suggestion and charge for entry to your wedding\n[laughter] no no I Can't I'm not even asking people to give me get but I Am going to go on the record right now and just said this publicly if anyone are it'd be peachy my wedding and bales at the last moment like that is not called\nHow can it be okay at least tell me two or three days before I can let all the vendors now [noise] Sarah thank you so much muscle tough [noise]\nAnd when you're out there just to come back and [noise]\nAnd now a modest proposal baseball more interesting\nFor the next week Nick I'm I Want to introduce you to lieutenant Danny Rome and he's a\nTop hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department I'm just kidding I just telling you the plot of an issue of how was it\nI still have a lot to watch anyway are actual final week is about baseball is also probably our most controversial tweak\nYes major league baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up the game\nLittle things like limiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter\nAnd that's all fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up they would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nEr my name is Stephen ... professor of politics at New York university you like baseball I'm a fan a but not a rabid fan\nNo not one who is willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose\nYou know I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah like you want to catch up on my stood on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a parole\nAnd baseball and works as follows a that\nIf you're the team ahead in an inning and Europe that then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data we\nLooked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back\nTo Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch\nFor over a hundred thousand games and asked if to catch up ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games are better than the average game which now about three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game a half an hour with the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there had been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's\nAlso got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them only Eighteen seconds at the end of a game\nLike ah how you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't go to any baseball games anytime soon you might get back to yeah long odds thrown at you\n\nIs there a tweak that you would like to see\nYou can email it to us we're Planet Money at\nGee we're also at Planet Money fund the twitters hand ... says you're so hip\nAlex ... marches are supervising producer Ryan or set is our\nChief episode tweeter I'm Kenny Malone and I'm the fast and\n\nAnd we have one more extra special guest\nJoining us in the studio today don't introduce yourself it's me standing room lieutenant Danny Roman from the negotiator in the flash and uh you you apparently have a week for us today do\nNever say no to a hostage taker Emanuel eliminates options the only option that leads to shoot someone understands\nIt gets that sort of makes sense I mean I don't I don't know that technically qualifies as like a tweak is more like a fight so patronizing me man I Know a no offense said no again I'll kill somebody or I was in um I think we're going to end this interview\nThat's really too bad because daddy rolling was just starting [noise]\nAnd um you know seem like a pretty good ideas so Samuel ... was able to get some Catholic nuns to provide a twenty five thousand dollar grant weight\nNuns yeah the sisters of mercy which is you'll hear in a moment the appropriate name or they were taking mercy on these two crazy entrepreneurs\nThey were selling their monastery and they were wanted to turn their principal into\nA local community action and some of the use that money to build the first yoga works so the\nSummer of eighty three you move to New Hampshire to to to start doing the fulltime right\nI moved into a three story would hit a log cabin or with 'em no plumbing and I put solar cells on it and ... and the Cayman family lives there and Senate and our interns are there's one big\nKind of happy crazy cow milking yogurt making a operation\nSo I mean how did the yogurt system started I mean it was being in being sort of put into jars and how did you how did you get it to customers at your salad how did you put a shingle out and said yogurt for sale\nWell we started with one cow\nSemi is the money to buy six more cash so now he's milking seven he finances this little tiny factory in\nA tiny little room that you could only really describe as a closet in a Seventeen Ninety two barn with the ... wood fired boiler and the way it worked was he\nPut in a fifty gallon stainless steel tank we bought plastic cups and send me it was a very charming and persuasive guy in after paying for his first shipment of cups he managed to somehow get continue to get shipments for five months without\nPaying for any more so\nHe started producing April nine Nineteen eighty three and took his first\nSix packs of yogurt and\nDrove down to the local supermarket to her woods and said would you guys sell this stuff well they didn't know what the heck this was [noise] and ... they said what price should we sell it to have a say I don't know whatever whatever price you think maybe we were not business people so we started selling\nAt a a dollar forty nine of court which is the same price down and was selling for it was like ambrosia guy was the most incredibly perfect product still the best thing we make\nYou guys just start to\nYou know basically sell it locally and\nAnd uh eventually the her which people cause that gosh you know this is good at selling a by the way way below the price we could afford but he couldn't keep up\nAnd he was out of cash and of course he wasn't paying bills when I arrived on September fifteenth of eighty three he\nHad these old army surplus desks in this farmhouse that the the three desks were piled high with envelopes on open mail and I said okay I'm now the executive director of the ... center and the vice president and stony feel farm\nAnd I'm going to spend my first that was the the name of the farm stony feel ... Oh yes the farm sorry yes of course and it's still there so I spent the morning separated and I thought the checks from the bills the only problem was there were no checks\nOr ... any money that have come and he had used it to buy feed\nOr or you know lubrication equipment fuel would whatever and by eleven AM that morning my first day I calculated that we were Seventy five thousand dollars in the red huh so what did you do well I did what any self respecting entrepreneur does I called my mother\nAnd I borrowed thirty thousand dollars from her which she could ill afford as I told you\nBefore she was you know her own business for was for you know family but you know I had a good fundraising scale so I went to many of my former funders and many of his and I said look and we\nThat these were the the ... farm that they had run back in\nMassachusetts right well Samuel had a handful of\nA folks who had been his ... like I said he he raised a hundred and twenty five thousand a year so there were there were probably twenty or thirty wealthy individuals and then I had raised a million dollars a year so I had [noise]\nYou know high net worth individuals\nOut there and I look what I told them was very simple I said\nTen years of our work was all about proving that you can grow food organically\nBut if we're going to be successful with this revolution I said to the funders who had gotten this there then we're going to have to prove that you can actually make money doing it and we're gonna have to build a model enterprise\nThat will show that you can avoid the use of pesticides avoid the use of hormones with cow's\nSupport family farmers not depend on fossil fuels et cetera et cetera all the things that we were doing in the nonprofit context I said you know this is I I'd like to ask you to join us in the next phase which is\nHelping us to build a successful business and and instead of asking for a grand I'm asking you for a long\nAnd I wound up borrowing a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd then I went out to our lenders have the hundred and twenty five K.\nAnd I said look I'm Will you take stock in this company and we did our first private placement [noise]\nYou know through a dart at the Weill figured out the value of the business will ... what is your value but at the time [laughter] well we\nThought we were going to value at at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred and fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries\nWere selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a an independent grocers seven stores and uh this will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night\nWere having dinner at the Caymans after Mel King and the phone rings and a ... the nephew of the\nOwner of the ... market basket chain ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling to my competitors and not to me now he had thirty four stores at the time and Sam is a well a to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that as very good business advice so we went out and\nGrew are heard even further and then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease a small refrigerator truck and started delivering actually to the market basket where warehouse\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and cases like twenty four\nCups six ... six packs of court so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but you\nWere probably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I kept not weekly\nCash flows not daily casually I kept hourly castle is yeah I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out who you know semi wasn't paying them so\nNow we're on very short terms with everybody I mean my fundraising skills turned out to be you know I mean we'd be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family's unbelievable\nAttention to detail they were perfection is up but we were also we would also be nowhere\nWithout my ability to keep getting credit and cash because it was burning [noise] I mean we were on you [noise]\nWhen we come back in just a moment have Gary and Daniel bags and borrowed to keep stony field going and how they almost lost it anyway again and again and again I'm Guy rise and you're listening to how I built this from NPR
