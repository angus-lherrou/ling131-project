I wanted to talk about a moment from from one of your shows I I heard the story about the guy who started air BNB I guess Joe Gambia yeah Jo Jo gap yet and it occurred to me that it is so odd because the concept of house sharing today feels completely natural but\nLike ten years ago renting a room to a complete stranger in your house was like a little creepy so I like what happened what what happened in the meantime\nI mean ... ... happened you know when she was starting out he was kind of a bind because he'd just graduated from college and he didn't have any money and his landlord raised the rent and so she had to come up with a way to pay the rent she started\nTo think about okay well how can we designer way out of this\nAnd that was when I I flipped it on a previous experience that I had back in Providence\nThe day before that I I I drove cross country I sold off all my stuff\nAnd when I was having that yard sale [noise] this guy pulled up in the ... the red moslem yada\nAnd starts looking at my stuff\nI'm getting pretty new ideas I'm ready to go home\nBut he ended up buying a piece of art that I was so and so we get to talking and he tells me all about\nHow he's about to go into the Peace Corps and you're driving cross country and he doesn't know a soul in Providence so invite him out for drinks at night and I make the mistake of asking him so where's Dana night [noise]\nAnd he makes it worse by saying [noise]\nActually I don't have a place [laughter] and I'm thinking oh man you got to where do you do you have to get in a place like we've all been there I liked by hosts this guy\nSo before I Know what I'm saying I'm like hey you can stay in an air but in my living room [noise] so that night I said I'm up in the living room and I I I go to bed and I tried to fall asleep I'm staring at the same thinking\nOh my God [noise]\nWould have I done there was a complete stranger in my living room yeah what if you think so as it turns out the guy was not psychotic and after letting this guy stay in his living room Joe gets an idea that he just can't shake\nI'm looking at my laptop and there's a design conference it's coming to San Francisco the industrial designers conference right [noise]\nAnd on the conference website in big red letters and said hotels sold out\nAnd I'm thinking oh man what a bummer designers want to come last minute they're not going to the place to stay in in that instant I look up and looking around the living room wait we have so much extra space here and I have an Airbus in the closet and the idea of hosting people in their beds had gradually become natural to me\nAnd the thinking is there'll be more than just the place to sleep we can cook breakfast in the morning we'll pick him up in the airport ah we'll give them a neighborhood guide and map to San Francisco so did how did you get the word out having the designers noted that this is available well we know we didn't want to use any of the classified Web sites because there's going to be people in our home\nSo we made her own remaining you may draw while we just on your website but how do you design your own Web site that said white well it said who we words said about the this concept of stay with us and we'll we'll provide these things for you I'm sort of swamps it was just for the design conference that's it you\nMean from it meant to be for one week and what did you call it the website it was literally called their bed and breakfast dot com\nAnd we started to get emails from around the world designers\nWho needed a place to say you must from London from Brazil from Japan people actually started sending us their resumes they're linked in profiles to to vie for one of these these limited three Airbus and\nFor how much was it for eighty dollars a night you could stay in San Francisco with Brian and I that's a great deal it was amazing deal just\nGive you had this great quality he was persistent he visualized his idea and eventually you get caught on and now ... is hugely successful\nAt what point to you and Brian look at each other and go okay man I think this is our business to that December we both went home for holidays\nAnd at our respective New Year's eve parties everyone of asked so what do you do and in San Francisco say well or entrepreneurs and well what do you watch ... and we didn't really have very much other than to say well let me tell by the time where we hosted these three guests on earbuds in her apartment and one of two things happen\nPeople they said oh my God that's the coolest thing in the world where can I Do that\nOr they said that is the most bizarre creepy thing I've ever heard\nAnd they left the conversation yeah and I think one of the things that I've learned is that great ideas I think they usually start out as polarizing they're not kind of like yeah it's kind of okay they either really tug on somebody's emotions or an elite and desire that they have never been answered before\nOr they really perturbed them in some way\nBut as long as there's people who who really gravitate towards the idea to me that's a signal about them you might be on something\nSo you guys have have obviously grown a bigger than than most or all hotel chains and you have some similar challenges to to companies like uber um with\nSill is a software developer but like the rest of us he doesn't really understand how bitcoin works you heard about it right when it launched in two thousand nine and he figured it can't hurt to have some of this stuff\nBut it was worth pennies and so he treated it like loose change never kept track didn't really know how many queens he had and then eventually\nLead it fall between the virtual couch cushions or whatever\nSo I think it's one of these computers sills hoping that inside of a computer up here is an old hard drive with an old file called big quaint a wallet that would give them access to his bitcoins which you would then felt immediately makes something like twenty five thousand dollars and then probably put that in a college fund for his one year old son\nSo we start taking these computers apart I I think we should take a hard drive out of this when anyone just in case but I don't think she's pretty sure that is not the right hard drive so he pries open the second view um okay oh there is a hard drive there are too hard drives on this one oh my goodness oh my God chances I really\nDid not expect to see hard drives in here to be honest what did you think it happened my thought was I took the hard drive out of this one and I think I really do think it is this hard drive this one terabytes\nMan this is actually really shocking to me because I actually did not think that this hard drive is going to be in here I mean should we just checked food just check that one now\n... ah [noise]\nYeah let's look at this when I feel head back downstairs with the hard drive is baby wakes up hey buddy he he puts up this old hard drive and still is worried that he erased this at some point and use it for video games but he's hoping searching for any sign of this wallet\nFile All right so um I got to where I Believe this would be there is a bitcoin directory in here where it should be so\nSo a ... or ... if it's in their their stuff in here there's a wallet\nThere's a wallet and there's block okay I don't know what this means but I'm going to copy the ...\nDr phil is pretty sure this is\nAnd to find out how much bitcoins on there he explains that he needs to wait while another piece of software download the entire history of every single bitcoin transaction in the world on to his home computer\nIt is going to take hours and unfortunately there's just no way to name and I can stick around for that\nBut how are you feeling right now like okay so what I'm feeling right now is my uh my hands are very sweaty yeah I'm just I'm kind of I'm kind of a little amazed and\nUh the the looking for the pennies and the couch cushions though that part of it yeah I think I found it but it's been crusted with some kind of like I don't know like a slow beer on the couch and like this thing is kind of stuck there and I don't know how to\nGet it off without ruining it yet [laughter] yeah so I think what we should do like when it's ready I think you and your wife should just record yourselves figuring out how much is in there okay does that sound good yeah that sounds like a good idea we can do that\nWhile still is waiting to learn his between fate I started to get curious about how many silt Turner's are out there in the world\nAnd the first thing that comes up when you search last bitcoin is the story of James how was\nIt was this um uh you would think through the stuff in your office and he found the hard drive why did you throw it I've ... I'm like I used it for three years um\nThis is a BBC interview with James he threw away a hard drive with seven and a half million dollars worth of bitcoins on it in fact this interview is at the landfill where he thinks the hard drive may have wound up\nYesterday they basically told me that anything that goes into the have told us about ... days compressed and buried\nBy the way this interview it's from two thousand and Thirteen a lot has happened since then more legitimate vendors started accepting bitcoin big time investors started trading it in his more and more people saw bitcoin as a way to make money the price has sky rocketed\nThose bitcoins James house lost at the beginning of this year were worth more than a hundred million dollars\nJames I'm sure there's an awful lot of people feeling fear right now how do you feel stood here\nAre some devastated as you can imagine [noise] um [noise] I just wish I could go back in telling them not so ...\nLast bitcoin has been this legendary thing within the bitcoin community but it's also been kind of anecdotal and I wanted to get a sense of the actual scale of this and of course there were economists already on this question are you\nOh I guess I didn't ask if you either you or individual bitcoin told her I hold a very small amount of it going okay I was writing\nA paper in twenty twelve I think on that client I bought a type of also a very small amount but mhm\nOh is it my turn yeah I don't have any bitcoin nor did I take it seriously at any point until about three weeks ago this is Kimberley ... and Jonathan Levine Kimberly is senior economist at a company called chain Alice is Jonathan is cofounder\nThe company makes software that can dissect bitcoin transactions to spot money laundering detect illicit behavior but also just to learn about bitcoin what what do people actually say that coin bitcoins you can have ... coins and bitcoin is like the currency union\nUnderstand how the James towels and the silt Turner's of the world can lose or nearly lose bitcoins we need to clear up a common misconception that I totally did not understand either\nThere are no bitcoins which I Know a digital it's not real but no no no there are not even digital things being traded back and forth with unique serial numbers or whatever that is not how the system works\nYeah yeah so if I send you bitcoin I send bitcoins your account on the big question book chain\nBlock chain big word sure but here is very non technical way of understanding what it means [noise] imagine with me if you will\nA massive auditory\nFilled with bitcoin for\nThat Jonathan wants to send me one bitcoin he walks on stage in front of all these books that's up to a microphone and he's like\nA an entire ...\nAh if all of your show I Jonathan\nHave three bitcoins to my ... of course it would not be a name that would be a an anonymous account number\nI Would like everyone here you know that I Am giving one will be going\nTo Kenya after Jonathan says this all of these virtual ledger keepers sort of scribbled this transaction down you know duct one bitcoin from Jonathan's account increase Kenyans account by one\nAnd that is a bitcoin transaction nothing is really transferred it's more like an instantaneous adjustment across a whole bunch of ledgers\nWhen people talk about the block chain they're talking about this system where there is no central bookkeeper\nAnd here's where losing bitcoin gets interesting because bitcoin ever disappears all of those computers keeping all of those books all show that my account now has one bitcoin the one that Jonathan gave me however\nIf I lose the key to that account there is no customer service line to call there is no bank I can plead with their is exactly one way into this virtual vault and it is with my private key what is it private key look like\nUm it's a string of letters and numbers um that's pretty lame actually can you give me an example a e nine\nEight seven three D. seven see sixty eight seven the Caesar F. B. six a five seven seven\nSixty four randomly generated numbers and letters this\nGoes on for a while three three to six to\nHave you go into virtually impossible to remember and if you will lose this key and never find again the bitcoins inside your virtual vault will sit there for eternity so when we talk about last bitcoin what we really mean is eternally frozen bitcoin accounts\nOkay Kenny did sill ever find his last big going well let's check with Phil and his and his wife Jackie who are at home opening his bit quite a while so you look\nYou\nKnow we've been doing it would be nothing nothing there's nothing in there it was a\nZero to [laughter] I think oh wait I sent point zero to from the ...\nWhat is ... is that his bitcoin vault is empty\nNot only is it empty he can check the history and he can see that this is clearly the wrong account he must have like set up a second to kind of test account a friend must have transferred him a little bit coin and then fill transferred it\nRight back I don't know how this works\nThis supposed to be my other wallet\nThe lung in the short of it sells wallet pass code are still out there on another device\nThat case continues to Kenny what is the moral of the story I I'm not I'm not I don't know I mean maybe it'd be very careful or if you buy bitcoin [noise]\nKeep your password somewhere yeah or maybe just by mid Clint give your money to public radio that\nIs a good moral we're we're a great investment you support us and we give you a great story in the news you rely on [noise]", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
