even imagine man I [noise] I Know I Know to open the doors how settled how's Seattle\n\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR stations it's how I built this from NPR's some guy Raj\nSo if you've recently walked to\nThe energy bar section of the supermarket you might be surprised or rather overwhelmed by the number of choices I mean for starters there are hundreds of different types of energy bars which is kind of crazy if you think about their protein bars in paleo bars and whole thirty and began and gluten free and cow\nAnd fused with macho powder there is probably an energy bar out there for each and every one of us and that whole revolution it really got started in the Nineteen nineties with cliff bar and if you've heard previous episodes of the show you might've heard our interview with Gary Erickson who actually\nInvented those clips bars well in the early to thousands\nOf Americans came up with a pretty simple concept that shockingly was really out there in the world it was an energy bar made from two or three ... like all men's or cash shoes\nAll bound together with the date ... may not seem like a big deal today right you can get them pretty much anywhere at any seven eleven but back\nIn the day they were kind of revolutionary and how she even came to inventing them to building this brand well there was no direct path Lara never intended to start our own business or even to sell a product she grew up in the\nDenver area her parents ran a pretty successful high and clothing store\nAnd Laura was really into sports you was actually good enough to make the USC women's volleyball team but after she graduated from college with a degree in psychology and she wasn't really sure what to do so she came back to Denver and got a job as a social worker and she started to work with kids and teenagers who needed help\nIt was hard I mean just emotionally difficult\nJob it was intense it was always chaotic um we were on call every six weeks I had to ... this is at a time where I had to carry a patron round remember the patron days and if the pager went off at two in the morning because somebody ran away from our treatment facility you had to answer the phone call\nBut it was it was intense work and to see\nYou know Fifteen year old girls for actually Thirteen year old girls with kids and I had to manage their care with the judicial system I went to court a lot I made recommendations\nIt was one of the most stressful jobs I ever had in my life and I was in my early twenties how long did it take you before you got burned out like a year and\nA half a year and a half you're doing this and you just decide this is not this is not for me\nI I knew I needed to change what the landscape looked like so I wanted to help these kids but I wanted to do it and more of a recreational component I didn't want to feel like I was the police all the time [noise]\nAnd so I became a community involvement leader and I got these kids involved in the community [noise] it was really fun I mean to this day I still think about these children and they wonder\nWhere they are what's happened what they're doing so during this time that I was being a social worker\nWorking as a social worker I was also cultivating this passion for natural foods I did that happen well so let's go back to college college volleyball ours are coach had a rule of no sugar and red meat\nSo at the time I was totally into junk food I was Eighteen years old\nYou know my favorite place to eat was any fast food restaurant you can name and then I all the ... sugar and no red meat [noise] it was really an interesting experience so I started feeling better so that was the first light bulb went off for me\nSo that I started thinking to myself in the background of going through this whole experience and feeling better I thought wow now I Love natural foods to make such this is common sense to me why don't people know about this why isn't somebody teaching us\nAbout healthy food and so my passions started to build [noise]\nSo I I guess at a certain point you stopped a working with kids and in ... did you find another job or did you\nUh did you start to just have like did you start to think about what you had\nTo what you want to do well\nI knew I had an excitement and passion for natural foods I just didn't know how it was going to make a transition between being a social worker and natural foods I needed to find the courage to take a leap of faith\nAnd somehow some way I figured that out for myself and I left my marriage I left my job\nAnd decided I'm going to go back to school and I'm the study I Want to get into that traffic\nMedical school ... ... ... like a like natural homeopathic remedies and stuff yes so I'm On my path of taking classes\nAnd I need a friend of mine who's a dear friend of mine now one day eating to help local health food store eating lunch and he dragged me to this\nFood class and I have one of the most amazing meals I've ever had in my life at this class and I thought wow [noise] fried foods are kind of amazing and it just never had occurred to me and then I went back to Colorado over Memorial Day weekend to visit one of my dearest friends and um\n[noise] I went hiking and\nI was just kind of needing a trail mix and thinking of food and raw foods and thinking about moving to Seattle and all of a sudden I'm On this mountain in this life goes off for me and I think why isn't somebody made something of\nFruit that some spices like something very just pure simple\nReal foods but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like don't junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nIt was like this surge of energy I God I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and that day in that time and all those little experiences that build tough I I just felt it\nWould you do did you like run home and and and and started like writing things down or drawing pictures or did you just kind of mulling over for all for a while so\nI ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver I thought how can I take fruit nuts and spices and and turn them into\nSomething really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay\nHow do I take cherry pie and make it just in my ... and are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining that's going to do a lot of cooking I'm and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like sticky\nBall of a match and then when you would like to get out with your hands and like I went out with a rolling\nTen and then um I got to cut her and I would like et cetera et cetera and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I'm sure many cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting salary how did you pay your bills um\nWithin about a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought\nI'm gonna start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah so the whole foods open their first store in Denver\nAt exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought\nI'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works I I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the\nBest decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this is people don't want one body's\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say I would buy those and that\nThat little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world I mean to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again our you just like sort of funding the spin like finding reunions and stuff and it and this was when you're using your own money\nAnd you know I had a job at whole foods and then\nI had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of grain information in a month we'd go by and",
