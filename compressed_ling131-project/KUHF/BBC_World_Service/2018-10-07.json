failed the confirmation of his nominee Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court as an historic victory\nWith Republicans already controlling the White House and Congress Mr Kevin O's appointment now in shows a conservative majority on the highest court in the United states but there's little sign of an end to the debates about allegations that Mr Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted women this report from Nick Bryant\nNot long after being concerned by the Senate Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice his hand on the Bible his wife and two daughters that his side\nIt means the nine member court now has a decisive conservative majority for the first time in decades Donald Trump who walks the votes on air force one telephone to congratulate his nominee and at a rally in Kansas described his confirmation as a tremendous victory for the United states and its constitution\nBut people of Bosnia voting on Sunday and elections that have been ... by ethnic abuse fraud and intimidation more than Twenty years after the ex you as a country was torn apart by war\nElection monitors say the campaigns in an unprecedented use of hate speech had the abuse of public funds are both ... correspondent guide alone I reports\nAnd it was able to happen because it was very much along party lines were number of senators who are wavering up until the last minute who could have turned to vote either way and they all declared well ahead of time\nIt was clear that that that Kavanaugh had the math but um that is the math of the votes but it was very sharply divided has probably the closest vote on the Supreme Court nominee and more than a hundred years\nWe'll know due to the balance of the Supreme Court\nThis means that the Supreme Court is going to have a conservative majority of solid conservative majority\nAnd probably will do for decades because as judges get lifetime position Brett Kavanaugh is replacing a conservative judge but that judge what's a swing vote sometimes he sided with liberals and Kevin ... is not going to do that he has a very strong record of conservative positions\nOn all of the issues that are expected to come up in front of the Supreme Court so that means that\nOver time an evolutionary sort of way we can expect to the Supreme Court to take a conservative positions on many social and other issues that come\nBefore it and when you talk about those issues and how they come up I mean how far into the future are we looking when we start to see possible change yeah well\nSay precisely but for example I'll give you an example there was some concern a lot of concern I should say on that from Democrats and and social liberals that\nMr Kavanaugh's nomination would put at risk women's abortion rights in particular that non that groundbreaking decision called roe versus Wade which made abortion legal throughout the country he's ascending to the inventor he's taking a seat on the Supreme Court is very unlikely\nTo do something dramatic is overturned that but there will be decisions coming up in states more rights to take decisions that would make it more difficult\nFor women to have abortions and so I think you could see for example that right being chipped away we wrote it depending on where you live in the country that is an example of something that you might see\nPresident Trump is obviously pleased about this outcome because this man was very much he's nomination but Duffy mean more for him than just the fact that he's a man who's go through\nOh yes it absolutely does it's probably his top political victory or at least among the top political\nVictories that he's had since he took office he\nPromised his voters that he would appoint conservative judges to the bench this is his second one\nAnd and you know this was a very important promise to many of those who voted for many of those who actually held their nose and voted for him because they didn't like much of what he stood for but this was so important to them\nThat they went along with it and now he has been able to deliver in less than two years into his term so this is an incredibly important victory for them and it's happened just about a month before mid term elections that are turning out to be hotly contested and that is also something that's useful for him he'll be\nUsing this and campaigning before the election\nBut

...\nThey're unhappy that the president's been in power for thirty six years it's a very young country of course as many African countries are now looking for change but this time it's different because this time for the first time elections being held in covering\nThe backdrop of a crisis and indeed what I think we could call it an emerging civil war in the end of certain parts of the country that's where about twenty percent of the country\nLeave there's been a political crisis that for two years now and the government didn't listen to the demands of the younger friends they wanted\nMore autonomy in the education sector and with the judiciary and the judicial sector the government really didn't listen to the majority in fact the government even looked up\nMost of the people that I should have talked to the right to the beginning of the crisis and then not radicalize the refunds and have a policy of them have started to four groups in certain areas and that's a real\nCrisis and of course it's a massive problem for the elections\nI don't get the sense though from what you've said that you think a much of that will change as a result of today's voting\nNo I think that's right I think the the vote today will change much I think like all these kinds of elections there kind of a at taking the temperature and they show up to about the direction of the country\nBut unless we get a really major upset they know in themselves going to change things what one way it's international crisis group or try to push for\nIs to get to talks with the with the ... the government needs to talk to the representatives of the ... a minority and they need to do the whatever happens with the election sign that sense I think you're right I think things are going to fundamentally change today but it does\nHappen state does give a sense of the temperature of the country\nA lot of the president's poll be a little bit about him while he stands for him while he believes in and how he has conducted himself in power for as long as he's been a\nTo the studios I think was to talk about your book on North Korea yeah which means I'm imagining you'll watching relations between Pyongyang and Washington quite closely at the moment to yes I Am what what do you what do you just said and from everything that's going on [noise]\nBut I think as I said last time I was here I'm\nKim [noise] the ... they need that on the north Korea and its um unless their mind I think ... diplomacy\nIt's actually handle the ... defeat election extremely well I mean what does the real goal video ... to unify the two countries economically income actually to South Korea and North Korea and that would be a message I Am today in economic times\nAh it will challenge her she'll like Japan and it will be a day may important trade partners for China\nSo this is the deal I'm do not Tom tom and made a lot of fast and the how to North Korea but at the end of the day I think so far as being out maneuver by you know\nI'm just that also mean that in your mind actually the relationship between Pyongyang and sold is more important that everyone should have been president moon's real liberal significant\nAbsolutely president moon that I'm as being dancing with [laughter] which came out that much like the other hand in hand to buy\nIt struck that is in love with him\nBut of course yeah I yeah I ... I went down to if you were saying that it shows of that ad says it's winning and so you never know but the truth is that\nNot denuclearization program has actually been done and um they said no way that North Korea were denuclearize I'm being part of China as being the eat and you know more paramount tenuous before I mean he went to China twice\nA day if it costs some contact to lead the Chinese so\nThe isolation that we've seen in two thousand and Seventeen is completely gone what ... what does Trump got in exchange yeah they certainly nothing from it fits that\nWe'll see we'll keep an eye on that no doubt in as well you said they were never going to talk about the Brazilian elections at various points during the program I think you would backing in Brazil fairly ... what sense do you get\nA ... as it's being happening in many other places in tennis polarized search and you'll find the family friends friends from old days or so divided and it's becoming abrasive\nPeople to the point if people breaking up friendships more so than before more so more than I've ever seen ...

Democrats are hoping to make gains in the house of representatives as well as the centers we can speak to caffeine frankly she's a leading expert in public opinion polling in the United states or caffeine welcome good morning\nWell good evening to be needing to me I didn't want to view morning from us ... tell us whether this kind of an issue has had any bearing on the wider posing as far as you can tell\n[noise] well it it seems to have in the last three weeks opinion of Kavanaugh himself has actually declined as the stories of potential sexual abuse and sexual harassment grew\nSo um he's been confirmed at a point at which more Americans think he should not have been confirmed and think he does however what has happened that is seems to be important in looking to the mid term elections\nIs that there are Republicans who have now become much more enthusiastic about casting a vote\nThe the big thing this this fall is is that there's ... everything in the house of representatives is is up\n... ... ... we're looking very good very poised to take over thirty five seats in the Senate are up that the third of the total number most of them are held by Democrats which makes it very difficult to force them to take control of the Senate they were hopeful because\nIn previous bowling that's much more likely to say they were in city after\nAbout voting this fall than Republicans were Republicans now thinks that they have an issue but I Will raise Republican enthusiasm and in fact in a lot in the economist you golf pools in the last week the percentage of Republican met\nAnd in particular does he I think about voting this year than usual rose eleven points living I'm I'm a large change\nIn a very short period of time a Democrat to have been enthusiastic Democrats have been I'm ed ... turning out in um special elections and in primary elections and [noise]\nAnd so now and I think we have a little a week or two of uneasiness we really do have to wait another week or so to see this right looks continues on or whatever it falls back now that Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed that they can be seen on the Supreme Court I'm ...\nI'm going to get into one I'm going to last rules for a moment we'll get some comments from the studio and also because the line is a little shaky between you and I was ... when you look at\nHow this might patterns what what comes to mind for research it's our surprised to hear the ah the events motivated the Republicans mostly a as we know Americans usually don't show up and hard numbers for electricity generically\nAnd the Democrats more motivated and then the Republicans but now it seems that this is motivated the Republicans\nWhich means I Would think that they will go towards a more conservative\nView in the mid term elections than we were expecting from previous reports and and as a hour specials just mentioned it looks like the Democrats will probably take over the house of representatives\nBut in ... for a little girl and the and the Senate\nOr the Russia [noise] yeah I tend to agree actually with some analysis and um [noise] I think that uh that I'm Tom is\nWinning more and more than the heart of the ...\nWhich is something that was not the case then beginning not because of the economic figures he can do well I think the economic\nFingers are very important because we have president all with benefits and economic uh up to an end for sure\nThe U.S economy is doing very well now they can do it of course I mean this is an economic size ... out here who was actually Obama started it and you know Tom is reaping the benefits but that's you know what is happening\nLet me let me go back to caffeine ideally but with a better line of you you had the remarks caffeine in the studio pick up on on any points you heard\n[noise] I I think my point that's very important to make is that opinion about Donald Trump seems on changing and he has stabilized at an approval rating that's around forty percent it goes up a point or two it goes down upon your two he is benefiting from what\nThere's a very good economy I'm just yesterday in fact\nThe unemployment rate is that we've seen in the United states since Nineteen sixty nine\nSo that's that's helping him on I think the problem in looking ahead to the ... the election which is thirty days away it's quite a ways away lots can happen a lot has been happening in the United states on but I think the problem is that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections\nAnd um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats\nUm it is that it's gonna be a state by state results on it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats take control of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIs it also affects the Democrats are clearly against something most of the sea Donald Trump put people are less clear about what their full\nI Do think that that's a very good point because it seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear\nThan it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to win\nOr what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump's they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme Court\nRepublicans have one that fits conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority they're on and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican and Susan ... as a would've\nContinued and perhaps even grown\nOver the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument that if the Democrats take control they will and teach Brett Kavanaugh on so to try to keep that concern that fear\nAt the top of people's minds is one way of making sure that Republicans stay committed um again I I think we can say much more about this in a week or two when we see how opinion has changed now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nSaid thank you very much for coming on a couch in front of you choose the leading expert in public opinion polling in the United states you know we were talking about the situation is stumble him to go we can go to a corresponding ... low in to get the latest on these reports\nThat Saudi journalist who disappeared off going into the country's ... she lives in Istanbul is now feared dead ... ... what do we know for sure at this stage\n[noise] well they all still allegations Julian other states so we don't do anything for sure but what we know in terms of the ... uh sources from the government is an initial investigation from turkey has found that Jamal ... who is a prominent Saudi dissidents critic\nUh off the uh the Saudi Government um is believed to have been killed off the heat and to the Saudi consulate last Tuesday to obtain documents his forthcoming wedding ... woman now be Texan investigation is saying that ... was killed in a premeditated murder\nOr some reports suggesting that a team of Fifteen people flew in from Saudi Arabia arrived at a concert last Tuesday hearing assemble some of them were officials\nAnd they all believed to have potentially being positive I hit squad on these talks investigation not saying how they believe he was killed that they believe his body was then removed from the consulate building I must say that\nA source of the Saudi Government uh untidy consulate hearing assemble a set of the allegations are baseless the Saudi Government is from is maintaining that John ... left the country in a building off to I'm entering it last Tuesday but he is he he disappeared off the top of that time\nAnd presumably there are ways that either side and couldn't substantiate what they're saying I mean some sort of TV cameras for example records of some description would surely exist to determine who goes in and out of a building like that\nThat's just over a week since the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of civil way see according to laces reports over one and a half thousand people have died\nMany of them in the coastal city of pilot where some researchers say the surge of the water was unusually high because of the way it traveled through what channel to hate that in combination it's also being pointed out that even if they were adequate tsunami warnings\nIt wouldn't have been possible to evacuate thousands of people with more or less half an hour's notice so it was the focus slowly moves towards rebuilding\nWhat can be done to create structures that can hold and protect people who do not have sufficient time to escape\nWith David McGovern his head he's been researching the impact of that you normally on manmade structures he specializes in more engineering at the London south bank University Welcome to the moon good morning thank you becoming a letter I made that observation in the introduction\nAbout the surge of water and the channel does it naturally traveled along how much of a factor has that being in what happened\n[noise] setting the um [noise] if you have a wave traveling down the channel what can happen it's difficult to tell it was quite early days at the moment but what can happen is the you can get reflections of the way bouncing off on the side\nAnd and they all have a lot more time to build up its wave height as it traveled down the channels so that could have been a factor in amplifying the damage that that way it might have caused\nI also mentioned how with so little notes the reality of evacuating thousands of people was just frankly was not going to happen that wasn't time\nYeah I mean that part of the world where you go over these crisscrossing folks very near the coastlines I'm\nEssentially because the ... the quite close to the coast you get this you know me very shortly after I mean that's never really goes to be\nThat much time to sound a warning and give people the chance to to go I mean that's just really the way it is because of the the geography of the area the same on the Japanese coast for example\nI think when you had about Fifteen minutes and twenty eleven have warning as well so\nIn which case you are then looking to the structure of the buildings that you hope will withstand this\nYeah yeah so in order to design buildings that we would call sue nominee resilient you need to think about a couple of things you need to think about how high they might be so the high enough to allow people to seek refuge above the water line and how strongly a sudden materials are made of\nAnd particularly how well founded they go into the bedrock and that's quite important are a lot of the stretches from what I've seen in the information that we're catching in that area were built on or not necessarily well founded into the bedroom built on sort of soil and sediment layers which may well or\nIf you have a structure on I've sort of this loose kind of material is not going to be as resilient to those kinds of forces um as it would be if it was founded well in the federal\n... what I say clearly maybe you can but you can't necessarily build every building on to that level but what you do need to do is build enough of big buildings presumably where people know they go to\nIn data so so [noise]\nSees me except for Nike let strokes has your dwellings and things like that it wouldn't be economical by um and it wouldn't be socially acceptable I wouldn't imagine to ask every person to live in a three story concrete reinforced house on stilts\nSo you need to kind of think about which buildings and ... there's two types of structure I Would say that you need to think about when increasing the resilience of an area so the first one would be a way to people seek refuge\nAnd those structures would only be for that purpose and you can build them outside of um says reinforced concrete and steel members without walls and so you can imagine a structure which is maybe the shell of a building doesn't have any side walls or anything like that it looks like a a a cop or something\nOr and you'd have a sort of a stairway around the side and people would evacuate the roof is building and maybe on the roof you'd have a hotline communications and medical supplies and some water\nAnd and the thing about that it's a it's going to be told us and be because there are no sidewalks and it's well founded into the bedrock the fullest of the water is much less ... most of the sitting on me what is just going to go straight through\nIf you bring my guess it makes them feel it's a question for the of what's in your mind [noise]\nWell I I guess my question is how realistic is it got in a poor country you can do something like that where the resources for that and as part of that question is how realistic is it to imagine not allowing people to build in those dangerous areas and for some somewhere else\nI I wouldn't want to\nAnd encourage anyone not to live anywhere I think um we like living by the sea it's where are you know for for a number of reasons also where people make a living is why they go\nTeaching is where the port so you know most of the ... I Love the world's population live by the ocean so the idea of just said you can't live in a place it's too dangerous especially actually these things these events a new we've had sort of three big events now in the last sort of Fifteen sixteen years but the the the relatively red\nSpeeding unfortunate this last two decades\nSo saying that you can't leave that as engineers I think what we want to do is try and encourage the built environment which allows people to live where they want to live in the most safe\nAnd resilient way um some of the structures like an evacuation ties not necessarily expensive um or difficult to build a it just needs to be a well pond and uh\nWell constructed with rock materials in the rye knowledge so it's a lot of this is about getting that knowledge to the people who have building these um these structures on the Russia\n[noise] I think it's a great idea and they may think that you can build a talent like that then you you can have people\nUh skating to the tower [noise] my my question is you will need to create a system now why do you do is try on rent to make sure\nThat he's going to what the people you know where they're going to that because one of the the the the reason why I\nOften we have a very high number of victims because people panic and said do the wrong think so especially in a densely populated area so I should think you know you need to like um\n... yeah maybe every ... or something\nLike that so that it's time\nConsuming you have to ... to convene to be able to do it and all that stuff and\nNo I I so I we can advise about the the engineering side of things but the whole\nIdea of resilience is a empowering the population yeah into\nTaking a sort of\nTheir own responsibility in in that safety ... I'm a ... about giving knowledge um are you aware of the evacuation structures which trips as the ones to evacuate too and seek reference to a certain time of day maybe every once in a shopping center maybe the shopping center should be designed\nA with them a structural integrity that will make it safe or the schools you know you've got kids in the schools maybe the schools should have a um but it really depends on uh the local authorities and the un societies and they they wish\nTo just a brief article so do you mean you mentioned Japan ... other lessons in Japan that people are beginning to learn specifically in this area\nUh yes so\nI actually visited Japan sort of three years ago to have a look at some of the reconstruction what they're doing and they were hit very badly by the twenty eleven tofu to nominate way and some of the things that they that doing so the Japanese are builds lots of big engineering they're they're they're really into that big engineering\nI'm so they build these large walls\nAnd one of the interesting things that I saw that they had a whole villages which unfortunately uh said watch out a sort of the smaller residential areas\nAnd and that building them in the same place but that building among artificial the reclaimed a hill so I saw the biggest in the\nPiling on lots of debt and soil and then they're just rebuilding it higher ups of the key is elevation\nThank you very much for coming in that split it like if they could McGovern [noise] it's a six forty two G.

I began by asking really\nAbout the warning system that's already being put to him and was in use this weekend by the Indonesian agency for me she wrote a G climatology and geophysics at the B. M. K. gee\nWeekend we ... we did have notification from its standard seismic network and they were able to identify\nFear of the earthquake and the magnitude\nOf the earthquake what they did not have\nWas data regarding the change in the water column that would indicate his anatomy\nThey also had type gauges but the tide gauges were regular tied gauges that catch the incoming tied in the morning and the outgoing tied in the evening\nBut they were set for every Fifteen minutes so they did not and they're also observation oh you can see the waves actually almost at the same time that the tide gay just come in\nIndonesia does have global positioning systems but I Believe there was the only one about two hundred\nKilometers away from the epicenter that would not have covered the area so in fact what damn cagey did not have was any measurement for the change in the water column that would indicate is sitting on\n... and that's a really important point which brings us onto the price of taught that you've been working on with other universities in Indonesia over the last few years because they're supposed to be a system of ocean senses on the ocean floor that would be able to detect changes in the wool to call them and that would give some kind of indication of us the nominee\nYes that's exactly what we're working on and we are very advanced in this prototype this is our last year for the project\nBut the prototype does need to be fully installed and tested before it could be approved for adoption and installation implementation and other coastal cities in Indonesia\nRight well let's find out more about the price so I've been so it's a system of sentences and they're able to measure and crush it basically be able to tell the tax changes in the will to call them so that would be the stigma of an oncoming see no me\nBut the really interesting here is how they communicate with each other because if there's an expensive fiber optic link between the senses but robots the Columbus has a ... how do they communicate with each other\nWell this is a very interesting part and here are ocean engineers are taking advantage of the thermal Klein layer in the ocean waters Indonesia located in stride the equator\nAs warm equatorial waters and the sound athlete bounces up to the surface and then re frack back down again so sound is able to carry much longer distances underwater in these equatorial waters than elsewhere\nOr just to be show the sound here is ... to be like so you're getting this really important to about water pressure and it's a waste of time trying to communicate with rage airwaves down that it's included into sound an bounces off the surface and back down to the other senses and you end up with the ...\nThat would that be right and so the electrical signals that are transmitted as sound are really transmitted from the bottom pressure censored to communication center\nThat transmits it to another communication center censor say twenty thirty kilometers away too and now they're they call this a bellhop method and then it is picked up by a cable center there's cable to ensure station\nAnd I came from a show station up to the fact like an eventually to the people who need to have the warning now about ... seconds they just very very crucial but only because we're stuck for time I wonder if you can just go on and tell us about\nHow if you think this would be on it was a ... at the moment it's of pot dying off the coast of the ... province\nBut if you can nail this price so I can get it working what difference would it make\nIt makes a huge difference because the undersea the acoustic communication is much less expensive than the surface Louise I'm In and also easier and safer to more secure\nTo maintain till it would be possible for a developing countries like Indonesia to mount and maintain\nSuch a ... a ... detection system\nSo that professor Louis ... listening to that bill Thompson\nI'm it's impressive to see how they're managing to sort of adaptive technology to to use as as you heard the sound waves in the water because of this particular ... properties to to be around\nIt just seems it's unfortunate that it did he have to pay for scientists to be some way that you need a low cost system because we can't afford to protect the lives of these people\nAre there isn't a whole sort of I'm an international response to this which would allow appropriate technology to be instilled obviously there are benefits to developing technology that keeps the coast out as much as it can be but that costs seems to be one of the factors ... deployed this system\nEffectively all these proving that he was getting out if he really unfortunate and you would think that we will be able to do something as a global community in areas are affect us you know these rather than have each country just have to fund these systems\nBuilt thank you very much for that what it's move on to a fresh warning this week about the security of our personal assistance out other voice activated gadget haven't listened to this\n[noise]\nWell that sounds pretty normal to me but that's actually something

can go in using the difference between human audio perfection and machine audio protection because humans of course have some limits to their perceptual ability for example after a very loud sound human wall\nIt'll to proceed with very quiet silent but free speech recognition system that's just the same and there's other effects like that so not only can you not your client sounds after an

masking effect that we were wondering if it would also be plus to use them to hide information from humans\nWhich would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting on thirty imperceptibly audio signals I Will malicious ... within berets towns and they might be able to trick or something like what about your

O. two increases is driving the extreme weather and sick and it says something about the way climate change was that does more than merely adjunct to worse whether by increments\nThat second one will take us to the Arctic which could be locking us into patents have drowned them then huge like we've seen this summer the first takes us to the new science of where the attribution as practiced by climate scientists like Oxford University Freddie also looking to the links between climate change and extreme weather\nWhat education brings is basically it's bringing climate change home where people live because while global mean temperature is a very good measure of climate change it is not what kills you\nHow climate change many this is through changing extreme weather events and so with that ... we can show which extreme weather events that people have experienced and you can say is climate change really a game changer here and it still by how much\nBut they're also extreme events that are not made more likely\nMean extremes are just part of the climate system they're part of the weather too they happen naturally but they're sometimes is a human induced effect on that and we want to be able to parse out what is natural from what is anthropogenic\nA very extreme and that is unique say you will never be able to say that an event was just caused by climate change I Would have an impulsive but without climate change how ... we can say is how the likelihood of an event occurring is changing the cause of climate change\nEarly player in this exercise is more ... of picks the ... Institute for climate impact research shoe in twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three still something of a climate model stern\nAnd the scorching Russian ... of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty twenty eleven\nClimate scientists more or\nLess worried about links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing changes and extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially huge waves but also after rainfall events\nAre from leaving pleasing to climate change and that this was already a rainy detectable observational data we have\nWith just a few years hindsight didn't crews ... paper seems well timed to find the sense of seen record temperatures above and the thing in recent climate history and this year is set to join them\nAlongside the global highs a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also ... them as they happen outfit will win attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask what what the likelihood of this heat wave occurring be in a well without enter the climate change and then the case of doubling ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been without putting a climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely to buy into the kidney climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures have over thirty degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that might be to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at like found that if a much much of it right then and the wealthy living so I was in the south on one and then it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty years then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are\nAll over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher layers in this house climate change actually make this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the emerging former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses to the comparisons\nThat are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise] so what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where ... ...\nYou mean the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wells expert so often the is finished and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen recently now taking shape\nWe won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the foreign up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading the extreme looms across a show one study said would not have been possible without climate change floods in central China that led to two hundred and fifty seven deaths in twenty two billion dollars of damage\nWas found to be influenced by global warming\nAre the chances found a climate fingerprint in ... in southern Africa in the deadly bleaching Australia's great Barrier Reef following a prolonged marine see twice\nAn in a European and pollution crisis that led to vehicle bands in Paris and elsewhere but looking back over the series of reports and they ... trends standout\nOh temperature no doubt a temperature the increase in the likelihood of daily extremes five daily extreme seasonal extremes\nThat right there is a pretty unequivocal at this point we have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spell ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the ... is just a few weeks back\nWell I live\n\n\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue and mia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually war we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the formation of these storms\nNorth south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it internist hearing on whether in more alarming directions\nYou know in one region the jet stream moved north what's it brings warm air from some topical regions far north Korea it's very warm temperatures region slide Siberia\nAnd at the same time beaches where the jet stream bent self words that brings in the Arctic all of a self correcting to flee cold conditions so what you tend to see if you have to wait for the jet stream your tendency alternating\nAre normally smuggled him off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand id\nAnd the particular version of this wave the most ... when Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents where these we'd go take up more and more energy become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at the weather diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out\nAnd that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just one particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing it extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nAround the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed costs and the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us in the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree wave residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if it is and Arctic warming is the drawing in the news from the ice caps not good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global CEO to emissions and the Shiites decline in the Arctic and we see it in summer but we also see it in all of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there is a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor\nIn terms of a long term trend of the ice change in the Arctic\nAnd in our two thousand sixteen paper we computers that for every metric tons of the year two that's added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters of the ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of any relationships and Clinton lotta forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate at sea ice last per increasing CEO to\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecast FCAT conditions from climate models that there'll be a conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than what the motives are forecasting so according to our calculations if this linear relationship or to hold\nOver the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September\nBut with more here too it off and start becoming ice free in August in October and it's sort of extending out from there and we cheer in about Twenty years\nIf this is interesting to go by indeed and he was a policy is that has to be very alarming\nClimate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate won't the world might look like if ... managed to keep average global warming below one point five degrees above pre industrial levels and ambitious and probably impossible target\nWhat we are learning is the worst the weather can throw it to us can be more dangerous than we did mentioned the

government targets alongside Afghan rebels Americans ousted the Taliban within weeks but at the top objective Osama bin Laden wasn't founded to a decade later hiding in neighboring Pakistan\nAh the one thing that will work the only thing that has ever worked is to price our roads\nOkay does that mean like having turnpike side of the place toll roads\nYeah so uh it's a very specific type of toll that's called the congestion charge and it is a dynamic toll which is to say that the level of the toll rises and falls based on the demand for the road at a given time\nAnd so it might look a lot like a total of ... that you see on many toll roads in the United states you know within easy pass or write something like that you drive under\nBut it is not designed to raise money which is what most toll roads the United states right now are designed to do they just raise some revenue either to pay for the cost of building the road or to the fray overall government cause this is a toll that at eight in the morning when lots of people want to be on the road it's higher\nAt midnight it's lowering it might in fact zero that the sole purpose of the price\nIs to allocate the road space so that it works it's sometimes called performance pricing because rather than the government's saying well we want to raise this much money from this road what they say instead is we want this road to flow at fifty five miles an hour that's the performance standard\nAnd the price can rise or fall the price can float to meet that standard\nIt almost sounds like you know\nThere's a fair amount of demand for gold like ... a lot of people would like to have gold and so it's pretty expensive to buy it if you want it and I feel like you're saying like it's very desirable to be on the road at eight in the morning so we're going to charge you a lot for that because there is a lot of demand for this thing\n[noise] absolutely and you don't even have to think about it as gold you can think about it for what it actually is a freeway going into a major metropolitan area right or a freeway going into New York city going into central Atlanta going into downtown Houston the four oh five into LA that's just it's land it's real estate\nAnd you if you look at the price of the surrounding land in all those places you know it's it's often some of the most valuable land in the world right right that if you wanted to occupy a piece of land in New York City or Los Angeles you would pay a lot of money\nBut if you had a car and you want it to get on to some publicly owned land at eight in the morning it would cost you nothing you know anyone who has ever suffered through an economics class and those that when you\nControl the price of something when you hold the price of something down below what sort of the market rate is one of the results who get as a shortage and congestion is basically just a shortage of road\nYou're listening to innovation ... with Michael ... a professor at UCLA an\nExpert on traffic [noise] okay so I think the first question that most you've only had listening to that is like well\nThat's an interesting idea and it might reduce traffic but here's the thing I like forty five minutes outside the city I have to get into the city and I cannot be paying like ten dollars every day to go in\nSo one of the objections absolutely that people have when they hear about congestion pricing if they look at a crowded freeway and their city and they just say my goodness you know there's thousands of people on this road we would have to get rid of hundreds if not thousands of them to make it go faster the the toll would have to be astronomically high\nA and I think it's true that in some areas at some times tolls could be quite high but I think it's also important to remember that a congestion road most of the delay on it comes from the last few vehicles\nLeave wow and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands of Singapore is a very dense city it's desert in San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain\nWhat we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance there's a great example it's congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free free way in orange county okay and\nDuring rush hour you will see traffic snarled in the free lanes and zipping right along at fifty five sixty miles an hour in the price planes\nA variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London in Stockholm where driving into the center of the city and this is not free weights but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charge to do so\nAnd that has been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging traffic delay went down by about thirty five percent\n[noise] so this is an issue that crosses party lines it's not partisan doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nUm but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see which kind of a local thing but do you see mayors governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to make people's commute a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is it the national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or authority over\nAnd it's also just not something that even if you look at polls you know if you ask them to American in a Gallup poll or something like this congestion bad they say yes mhm but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region\nOnly a handful of reagents just congestion rank really high mhm so I think it it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members are and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle\nAnd the question of you know\nAnd you know you look at all that and you think this is a recipe for disaster in banking right no incentives and lots of empowerment lots of risk\nThere the um you know they've consistently had higher profitability than their peers every single year for decades at least fifty years at this point literally every single year\nThey have the lowest default rates among their peers they've expanded into countries where there's strong bonus cultures and they do justice well there\nAnd what's interesting about them as they have many of the elements that we outlined in the article and so no short term bonuses but they're very long term profit sharing profit sharing meaning that if the company has a whole means at school of having return on equity greater than appears profitability better than appears [noise]\nEverybody shares everybody shares in ... it gets a share of the prophet of the company but you have to hold that share until you're sixty three very very long term memory okay and then that piece of ownership like incentives right the long term ownership again is really just a signal that we're all in this together that if you do all this will all sharing the rewards at the end of the day\nYou're listening to innovation haven't ... Dennis Campbell is professor of business administration at Harvard Business school we're talking about how sharing profits of the employees can make companies more productive how much does it cost companies to share some of their profits because I feel like that's where the resistance kicks in\nSo I ... I mean you know one way to look at it I I Know this is a little controversial but one way to look at it as it's free in a sense which is that look if if employees are actually improving process profits are actually this is leading them to actually um you'll find innovations to be more creative in their work expend more effort become more productive\nThat profit goes up they you know share and they share and that you're still getting you're still getting um you know a share of something more than you would have had before and so I think um you know one way to look at the ... it's free if you if you put all of the innovations that we're talking about an article in the place\nIf we believe productivity profitability will increase we think the research supports that that ultimately that's coming from the employees and so if you're sharing some small portion of that with them and that's actually leading to those games I think um you know one way to one way to look at it is that it doesn't cost much at all\nWe talked to some degree about giving stock which is like I said and done with white collar employee use all the time kind of depends a little bit on the industry it's done widely\nUm and if you extend that to blue collar employees I just wonder you know somebody gets a lot of stock from one company but let's say they don't have a lot of other stock\nAnd then the company doesn't do well hum do you worry about that do you think like maybe an old fashioned pension is the way to go or just a higher salary is the way to go instead of\n... I mean the other thing is at the moment that the stock doesn't do well that is also the moment when they're most likely to lose their job potentially and so they have all this money bound up with this one company\n[noise] so I think there's a bunch of things to unpack there I'd want one of them is that you know we might not be talking here about\nHaving the vast majority of their pay tied up in this in fact I think when you kind of create these kinds of incentives that doesn't need to be the majority of the pay in fact it shouldn't be that but again the day you don't want to impose too much risk on these on these employees at this level\nSo I think that that's one thing to think about and that that normally we would not see if you're going to go that far and it's going to be stuck on a ship that they're still going to be a fixed salary they're still going to be able to look at it and\nNow they're giving you maybe ten twenty percent of pay like a ...\nSomething there's something on that order I could be a little more but something on that sort of order so I think that's one is you don't want to impose too much risk the other is I think that you know this is where it's important to do the other part of\nWhat we're proposing which is do the hard work in creating the trends parents who organization and the learning environment so that employees actually see the connection between what they do in the results because\nIf you don't then this can be completely de motivating and this is exactly where it's a problem if you just focus on the incentive piece of this right because ultimately if\nIf the case you propose happens and and stock price goes down employees think like why am I getting punished for something that I didn't create you know and I think that getting them to show to see the connection between their results their their performance and what's happening in the broader picture I think that's really important if you want to make this work\nAre there are people like CEOs political leaders are and we certainly have seen a lot of\nIn the last few years you know action in the streets are strikes by ... you know I think about teachers um are there people you think you can get on a soapbox and say we need a different um mold for blue collar work we need a different contract with workers than what we've seen developing over the past generation\nYou know my perspective on this is that it's not likely to happen to the political process in fact this is kind of where I'm\nYou know one of the motivations for writing this article and really starting to look into the space more I think that\nThe real change is going to come when\nBusiness leaders see the benefits of these approaches start to adopt them widely when investors start to see the value like would kick yards doing when you start to see the value\nIn this capital starts to go to these sorts of ah companies that just in the way that you see a lot of them you know companies undertaking environmental and social sort of initiatives and there's been a lot of reporting and transparency around that people there's a demand side to that that consumers want to see that the broader society wants to see that in companies do respond and I think\nIf um you know leaders start to see the economic value that can be created here investors start to see that as well\nI I think that that's going to drive change more than\nA political process that's my perspective at least since cameras professor and this is the man station at Harvard Business school thank you so much for your time thank you for having me it was a lot of fun [noise]\n\n\n\nCampbell's original article on how to think blue collar jobs in America including companies that are doing just that that at our website also on our website if you're over on the right hand side you'll find in a ... shirt some cases you can check out all the different styles that innovation had dot org [noise]\n\nComing at what we look at the seven deadly sins as a little bit difficult and a little more biological is on the\nPins seem very cool human instinct to a ... a modicum of which are extremely good and an excessive which is really really really\nBad from P.
