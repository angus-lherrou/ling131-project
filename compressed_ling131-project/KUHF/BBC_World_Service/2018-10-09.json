election is the result to catch him from his heart is representative ... stations across the country in polling stations\nEthical and what does that surely is so many of the opposition parties including his somebody didn't have the resources to have representatives in every polling station\nExactly and that's why all the opposition parties have also come out to the bone any ah any declaring

work from the ... a couple of weeks after runs on 'cause they're off the head of Chechnya\nFound out that he was banned from Instagram for those of the fact that he had done up on a U.S sanctions list uh after that happened at the end of the summer he made a couple of very strong kind of spicy strengthening public statements against human rights defenders and so did his a medical\nYou know there's no direct link I'm just telling you what the chronology is over at the end of December he got kicked off Instagram because he was on the ... probably because he was on the sanctions list although we don't know for sure all we know is it is to ground blocked his account\nAnd he has to go on with ... new set of main way or the ... communicated with the public had more than two million followers lots of threatening statements are made January nice basically the day after the you know the all the rest of the holidays and suddenly to test is arrested\nThe police planted marijuana in his car and suddenly we find that the the old the mention the rights leader and ships now is behind bars on completely bogus marijuana possession charges\nWhat'd you call them ... when Ronald churches\nBecause it seems pretty clear that that the marijuana was planted in his car that seems pretty clear for what's come about in court so far all the police who were witnesses\nDon't remember anything he was brought twice so the police station but only once officially it seems pretty clear that the marijuana was planted it says car there were several instances when critics of Trump's on could era policies have found themselves behind bars on Sony drug charges ...\nSo it's really a one off the top and before it's definitely not a runoff taught me a bitch about whose work the before the rest of us has met him when this award\nI used to as the head of the violence which now for two thousand and nine and as the head of this organization which is the only remaining\nHuman rights organization that can work openly or that could work openly and ... now you have to understand how challenging that isn't just how much courage it takes to have such an organization they're given how repressive that republic has become under could erupt leadership\nHis work consisted of everything from running a pro bono legal services for people who had all kinds of problems ranging from I'm not getting their pensions in time we're knocking their pensions at all or wage disputes things like that\nYou heard about much more sensitive cases involving force disappearances or collective punishment health earnings\nExtrajudicial executions and such and he had to take some pretty serious decisions about whether they make these cases public\nIn order to make sure that the people who are handing him you know these accounts that they don't suffer any retaliation for sharing that their stories with him so he was for his mind was always the security and safety of victims and witnesses\nAnd not another part of his work with some effect I think what it was his project he had to shore ... books for libraries in the remote mountain region such ... now\nI Wonder what this war does for him it'll just be attention to him when he became one of the more as well\nBut looking at the end but but it's also helped or possibly in some cases some will say frustrate I'm supposed to get some released\nI don't think it will have any effect on his trial I think what it will do is provide really important moral support for you for his colleagues as friends relatives and for the organizations\nAnd or your book

event tonight was purely ceremonial some including the conservative Washington conservative Washington Examiner described it as part of the Trump victory lap over the cabin on ... confirmation\nIf you'd like to be finished with the cabin our conversation and move on to the issues you care about most\nMaybe tell that to the president\nHere's what he said at the White House a short while ago\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure for\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception what happened to the cabinet or a family violates\nEvery notion of fairness decency and due process and here's what do you have to say this morning\nOh I've been hearing that now they're thinking about it [noise] hey when\nJump I've heard that for many people I think his [noise] and then sell to the American public and I think you're going to see a lot of things\nOn November sex that would\nFear and loathing in lots of anger is that what the political conversation is going to be for the next month is that a winning message for Republican\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell thinks oh\nOh the tactics there'd been employed both by Judiciary Committee or Democratic senators\nAnd bother you know the virtual mob to solve all of us in the course of the process has turned our voters on for hours talking to my political advisors yesterday about\nThe advantage of these guys by their tactics are given to us going under these registry competitive races\nAre right Nick thank you very much for for calling in order to bring back in ... and Karen and Karen Finney to get your reaction students to call typically\nI'm Karen or this idea that Democrats are to basically Democrats are too nice\nWell a\nWireless story so how is this ... narrow the focus here I'm In the mid term elections and also think about this from your vantage point person in this in this midterm election and certainly in twenty twenty easy at vital for Democrats to\nGo at these races fighting [noise]\nYes and I ... and ... and then you know that I Am a firm believer that you have to do both though I think on the one hand particularly in this cycle and I was communications director of the DNC and the two thousand six cycle which was the last time we\nWe actually had a big victory on the Democratic side and I think you have to have to sort of\nIf you will prosecuted critique about what is happening in the country\nUm that is a ride or stray from where it should be so in this instance and as we've seen in the past you know it is a culture of corruption the way that the president President Trump tends to use the administration and the levers of government kind of\nHas his own some would say criminal enterprise I say for you know it's the party of me I think is or it's you know it's about me\nBut to something I think Colin Powell said a ... somewhat recently instead of being about the country\nUm but then at the same time you have to be able to have a critique because particularly at this moment Republicans controlled everything right so House Senate now the Supreme Court they have a conservative majority as well as the White House\nSo at the same time if you're a democratic if you're a challenger or if your income then you've got to have an argument that says here's what we would do differently and I and I do think that is something of democratic candidates I'm doing a good job of\nYou know they ... they were for the people and what they talk about is you know let's let's do things let's get that infrastructure build done and create jobs and talk about raising wages and how do we bring down health care costs\nAre and and instead of having you know member Republican members of Congress spend their time protecting President Trump from various investigations let's get back to the work of the Congress and the job that we're supposed to do so I really believe you have to have both so Chris\nAnd given ... just said I'm just wondering um you know she argues that Democrats need to say here's what we will do differently will that work\nIn a midterm uh mid term election campaign that is defined by rage as defined by the the president's outspokenness by the Senate majority leader's outspokenness\nI think there are the bases of both parties are quite frustrated and angry right now but I Do think there are voters in the middle who are not necessarily full of rage and anger but instead\nThey feel like things are going okay in terms of the economy but they feel like we can't go on like this in terms of aren't than national tenor of our discussion is it's not that they themselves\nFeel rage but more concern and in some things I see that it just feels like this can't be right this can't be how our country is going to function from here on out\nSo we don't necessarily know that at least those voters in in the broad middle are looking\nTo sort of have their rage buttons pushed I think what they're looking for is for someone to\nFear with real world consequences we talk with the W. singer and Emerson broken authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media China [noise]\nTuesday Morning

from Miami is Rolling Stone\nSenior writer Tamil Smith and still with us from Washington are Republican pollster Kristen ... Anderson and democratic strategist\nKaren Finney we were talking about a rage uh raised as a result of the Kavanaugh a confirmation process and swearing in the comments from the president\nOf both this morning and just earlier this evening a during this the second swearing in an now justice Kavanaugh\nAnd I want to get more into um women's rage at at this point and senator Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a address the issue of whether she was angry about what was happening here's what she said\nI Am angry [noise]\nAngry women down as one [noise]\n\nShe goes on to say I am angry because of everyone who has lost power\nA junk mail and I'm going to bring in I'm Kristin and caring into this the the women's rage the anger of women in around the country over what happened to Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this confirmation process the response of now justice\nBrett Kavanaugh if you listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or even the president the the rage that is being expressed felt and expressed by women is immaterial if not ignored\nAnd um when you're the historian I Do I Do it's it's like the current path but how does this fit where would you place this moment that we're in the conversation that we're having as a country where do you place it in the arc of American history\nSo I guess there's two arcs where I Would situated one has to do with sexual equality and sexual violence and that's the one that everyone is talking about 'cause it's just I mean the [noise] it's just a viscerally\nIt's confronting us right whatever your views are about it or your personal experiences\nIs an incredibly painful story right I mean I think everybody agrees the whole thing is quite painful and that because it's so visceral and so I think the media and personal from so many people\nAre men and women that it's hard to see it as anything but another chapter in kind of a culture war about sex and the long tale of sexual revolution\nBut the other lands that as a historian seems to me maybe structurally more important\nIs the dramatic change in the process of Supreme Court confirmation so recall that the in the constitutional convention the president chose the\nSupreme Court nominee and at the last minute sort of Senate approval was added but the public isn't doesn't have a role in choosing the Supreme Court\nOr the nominee now or the confirmation of the Supreme Court and in fact for most of the nineteenth century\nSupreme Court nominees never went to the committee is just it's the Senate just voted like you know the president made in set a name and said it said yes it is on and it's not until Nineteen twenty five at any nominee even appears before the committee like we think this is just an unnecessary part of the process for some kind of constitutional requirement\nAnd the guy who prison I was just because he's actually suspected of crime [laughter] right next to appear in Nineteen thirty nine there rumors that he's a communist and so he comes before the committee says no I'm not a communist I've never been to Colombia and the only reason they call in because the last guy from Nineteen thirty seven\nIt turned out he had been a member of the KKK and after he he was affirmed people like to bring before the committee and asked me was remember the get get get so what we what are the sort of the limits like\nGuilty of a crime of member of the KKK a communist what what Kavanaugh stands accused of his our version of that right but it's still\nA weird thing that we all sit and watch the proceedings that doesn't start until Nineteen eighty seven was Robert Bork which I think is really better understood as the last of the Watergate hearings because Bork had been involved in a bid\nNixon solicitor general but where we are now is\nRemember when uh Mitch McConnell said when he when a convened a hearing over the Merrick Garland nomination but he wouldn't do that because the American people had a right to choose the next Supreme Court justice because he was going to wait for the ... election right\nThat's just not true like that actually constitutionally is not how we choose our Supreme Court justice is the American people do not\nChoose the next Supreme Court justice but I mean it's totally reckless thing for him to have said it's just for the short term political gain he just didn't want to have you know he wanted to have a different I Wanna have a conservative on on the court and he was willing to throw away anything any reasonable sense of fairness or procedure to do that\nAnd but you think about the ... of that and here with the cabinet proceeding and the kind of everybody watching it in the middle of their workday and tweeting about it and says this somehow in a de facto sense people believe that like by Twitter we should just decide who the Supreme\nCourt services and I mean I suppose someone could say that's how we should do it but that was actually not what the the provision the separation of powers that uh the constitution dictates so we make a different decision but I I just think structurally terms of did you get your course like in the long arc of American history what does this about\nIt is actually about a very we sense that the Supreme Court\nIs answerable sprinklers meant to be insulated from public opinion that's why they're lifetime appointments and they're not elected final\nQuestion what would you say to people what would you tell people who are are dismayed by the current Tanner and tone of politics or were they might feel history is going what would you would you tell them\nWhere I share that concern unreal alarm or in a number of places but one is because our partisanship has become automated so the deep polarized positions of the parties were created\nManually by hand by political consultants and campaigns in the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties but starting in the Nineteen nineties with the opening of the Internet to commercial traffic and certainly in the first decade of the twenty first century with social media those that partisanship became fully automated so I think a lot of people would like a less polarized\nPolitical conversation but until we demand more of\nPeople who tinker with that machine we won't get their\nBanks the Jill Lepore and all of our gifts and to all of you for listening so you tomorrow on America

these have essentially being ... says harsh words ... ... some embarrassing news cycles with the Russian government but nothing particularly sub sensitive\nUm the question is whether or not it's an

be embarrassing for the Kremlin but not really substantial\nI don't actually see any appetite for any real money a new sanctions or similar so this is probably as far as it's going to go\nTo a doctor Mark Kelly out too many thanks for joining us\nHey it's coming up five minutes yeah this is Newsday hello legalization of kind of is is very big story of being falling into the U.S state by state the trade is moving out of the shadows and discussion as often dominated by entrenched positions which is why it's interesting to hear from Neil Polack\nHe's popped dad big user big defender of the wheat didn't stopping working as a writer and being a good dad he was just a pulse dad\nTrouble is he's found that decades of smoking I'd actually made him a kind of ... addict so of course he's in favor of cannabis these very keen to add a health warning at a time that it's going to legal he's had to give it up and he's written about this on her knee for the New York times lots of interest on mine has a bit of Neal story\nI had a um a public melt down while I was high and it happened in Los Angeles at a Dodger Stadium which is a baseball stadium and I was actually attending the world series in Los Angeles and I I purchased a ticket\nOnline uh and it turned out to be from a fraudulent third parties seller and and now it's this on Facebook and I got a message from some random guy but never met before he said I live near the stadium one to come by my house and we can smoke up as I was a very you know public stoner and everyone wanted to\nWanted to get high with me right so\nI went and I smoked his weed and then I have this joint that I bought at a\nStore and it had crystallized G. H. D. in on the outside of it was kind of like smoking marijuana burden of crack\nSo by the time I got to the stadium I was blasted absolutely gone I was just scored it away from the stadium by security and I went into the parking lot and I caught a glimpse of myself and a sign of a car and I didn't like what I saw\n... that's interesting people like you who have always defended marijuana and kind of say it's largely homeless you still believe it should be legalized and yet he was writing an article about how harmful it can be\nSort of seems like a contradiction in your attitudes Neal is fascinating\nWell not really I mean if you think about it marijuana being illegal has hurt millions of lives people have been unjustly imprisoned or selling it for possessing it it's often used as an excuse by police to arrest people on flimsy pretext and it's all it's often used\nForces not for good and it's also um there's also the fact that it has\nSalutary medical applications right I mean you know I met children who have intractable epilepsy and the only thing that's been able to cure them is a massive doses of THC ... veterans with post traumatic stress disorder get only\nTheir headaches going that will come down there headaches as marijuana you know and there's many other examples of people in extreme pain from cancer\nTaking NASA does the THC instead of or CBD instead of um opioids\nAre but that said I'm not any of those people write I'm a I'm you know regular guy without any particular health problems but I Do have an addictive personality and marijuana can lead to mental health problems\nPeople are more likely to listen to ... dad because of what you did this kind of got the bone to find these people are going to listen to you won't simply would be the message it's it's legal enjoy it but won't\nIt's legal enjoy it but be careful if you find that it is affecting your relationships if it's affecting your work if your entire life becomes about obtaining it and using it and hanging out with people who are obtaining it and using it then you might have a problem\nYou're going to listen to that if he's ... dead on ... another thing that Neal said which is very interesting was that he sent them it's no coincidence that alcoholics and none of us he said was founded\nOff to the lifting of prohibition or so Americans weren't allowed to drink than they were allowed to drink than in most of them how to drink problem and he thinks that the same thing is happening now in America at the moment and just as\nOne of a sudden there was a great slew of Nineteen thirties novels about the perils of drink and how it affected people he reckons\nThere's going to be a whole load of films and movies and TV and writing\nAbout the perils of pulse a heat for one is abstaining thanks to pump that Neal Polack [noise]\nGood morning I'm Stephen K your National Weather service forecast includes a slight chance of showers tonight mostly cloudy skies with the low in the mid seventies as we head into Tuesday we will see some sunshine with a high near eighty eight and a lower around Seventy four\nCurrently at Seventy nine Houston Public media is a service of the University of Houston and supported with your gifts to the Houston Public media foundation find more information at Houston Public media dot org slash donate\nWhether or not you give to Houston Public media we strive to maintain your trust everyday being a member makes a difference in your life and the life of the community thank you for supporting trustworthy journalism on news eighty eight seven\n\nAnd this is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven K.

American cities I'm essential in Harlem I mainly African American district of Manhattan in New York City\nCouncil I wondered if you could paint a picture for is nineteenth associates Harlem and the jazz scene because this was a hotbed of African American intellectuals and cool style listening\nYes it was and I'm\nHelen became this mecca for African Americans what was known as the great migration

and that came to symbolize an aspect of Harlem at that time\nI'm wanting to do since last the giants and the big band music but as long as that conform to their expectations but Joe it's right isn't it that there were different performance styles around in the Nineteen twenties and thirties and it's important to understand how they just said in order to appreciate how the concept of cool developed to tell you briefly citizen\nSo in the Nineteen thirties the front man of a big band like Duke Ellington are kept how he had to be sort of a dandy and aristocratic person because that's what white Americans expected this is a highly racist period\nSo there has to be a certain amount of what you cater to the audience is a compromise to playing and creating the kind of artistic music you wanted to create\nSomething cool to me was that can you explain that\nSo the mask of cool is in immediate direct reaction to uncle Tommy pretty much all African Americans had an Uncle Tom in public in front of white people which means they had to smile and and tougher and pretend\nThey they knew their place if not they were often actually treated violently by the police by anybody and\nSo the main jazz musician who Uncle Tom public was Louis Armstrong as great a musician as he was he had come out of the deep\nSouth and that's what he had learned\nIs that that's how you survive\nReal moonshine in [noise]\nOn the ... [noise]\n... burning\nSolving low\nAnd cool was a math but say we are not going to smile or differ or laugh anymore where artist\nWhen musicians we're human beings and we will not allow white Americans to define who we are\nAnd into this environment Wilkes effects will finish schools left too young to chill you believed to find who in one of ... and American culture right well Lester Young took the word cool that was then heard in the after American community and he's\nThe first person to use cool as a state of mind as a philosophy isn't the static when Lester Young said I'm cool he meant I Am here in my own style in this environment um and I'm relaxed which is not something that most\nBlack Americans could feel anywhere in the Nineteen forties\n... can you just give us an idea of young person or an style\nSo Lester Young was cool what that means at the time was he invented several different strategies we still associate with cool and they were all at first to defy racism and protect him\nSo one was not only did he speak in a jazz slang he also had very personal jazz slang such that\nIt was impenetrable it was a code second of all she wore sunglasses at night and onstage and sunglasses shades are in fact probably the single object most associated with cool if you actually tax the word cool what comes up as an icon with sunglasses on\nSo sunglasses provider sense of mystery that's why they work that way but she ... them\nAt night and onstage as a way of keeping why people at arm's length\nAnd Soviet shades here flag he walked in a very relaxed won't matter but most of all Lester Young saxophone style was cool it was an urbane romanticism that was both elegant and expressive and rhythmic and it was one of the most distinctive artistic styles of the ... century\nHere's a brief clip Lester Young himself speaking in Nineteen fifty nine about the way African Americans with stereotyped\nWho is in [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... Lester Young speaking not long before he died on a recording that features in the coming film president of beauty direction by Henry fettuccine since we've had that Lester Young embraced cool an influence other jazz musicians including the next generation people like the trumpets or Miles Davis whose music ... at the beginning of the program\nCarol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\nWell Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how we changed jazz music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home to so much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he tons of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style and this meant um jacket and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on\nUniversity campuses in the United states where that is bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles and he's on the front 'cause there is no graphics [noise]\nSo it's very unusual even Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in a um his jacket beautiful pale colors to fight club's cap a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black therefore I Am deal with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men you are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why was\nThat this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public tickets hit but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family you know how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties they way we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stress this idea of visibility a sense of pride making a life for themselves and Britain despite over in spite of\nThe racism to pull up our system that was rife in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nUp to this point we defined cool is largely an African American concept something that was developed by John's musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but won't Johnson's at the height of its popularity the idea of who was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one and cash and buying one time and [noise]\nOn June joined smaller towns and all of them were\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael coaches including this was a new type of crude which ... the concept to the Hollywood movie audience with the new ... what was known as filmed wrong how does still knew all relate to cool\nWell film water protagonists are disillusioned I'm cynical loners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of curse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIt's just that the beat generation writers word jazz fans all them\nAnd jazz was the dominant sub culture of New York in the forties and fifties and so they were a jazz clubs all the time and particular Jack Kerouac who writes on the road and is the best known of the beat generation writers was a huge jazz fan uh in fact he called himself a jazz poet\nOr in his book Mexico City blues so what's really interesting about this period is they they take this new term cool that they hear a jazz clubs and among African Americans\nAnd they're fascinating assessed with it and so in that period a coward writes a letter to his friend Neal Pasadena Nineteen fifty says I'm obsessed with cool to the point of a theory\nAnd he goes on to talk about his own obsession with the term so jazz is the first art form which cool expresses itself along with Bill Maher and the writers of the beat generation\nUnderstand that they are looking at a very new definition of artistic expression and improvisation and that's what they're going to take as their method and so the reason I say it's not quite appropriation is it's an artistic method and then they say well how would that work and literature\nAnd so ... actually calls his writing style bop prosperity which means bebop prose which means jazz writing\nAnd so to that effect it's an artistic transfer more than it is a racial or a sort of effect\nThing of the unfortunate part of it is that correct did not represent African Americans as well and literature as he did understand jazz as amusing\nLet's have a short extract from Jack Kerouac famous novel on the road\nBack then I was always looking for what\nYour job pretty good for ...\nFree life an alternative you know\nAway from the nine to five away from the men and Brooks suits wanting to sell ya after she have refrigerators life insurance\nWe had no idea what form that who live my technical again it was kicks and bomb fuel\nYou could make it sound them if you want\nBut at least he was looking for that message and the smoke\nThat one perfect solo or if you make it sound like looking for a great deal\nI think that's right and extract from ... on the road published in Nineteen fifty seven I'm traumatized by a ton of sense of the BBC in Nineteen Ninety fool with just Lynn counting them as Laura and students Michigan as a child\nWho did this idea that African Americans seem to hold the key to cool and could provide some kind of model to fight conformity\nGained currency thanks to an essay by the influential American writer Norman Mailer right\nYes ah the white negro superficial reflections on the hipster was written by Norman Mailer for dissent magazine in Nineteen fifty seven negro was a term used at the time by black Americans\nMiller argued and his essay that Nazi atrocities and the atomic bomb produced a widespread fear that we're all doomed that human extinction was imminent\nHe argued that this situation produced the phenomenon of hipsters have chosen not to live in fear but to reject what he called a slow death by conformity and escape boredom by unleashing their desires they chose to live in the present and celebrate energy in constant movement to swing\nHe wrote that they rejected the moral judgments of the past to experience immediate pleasures instead\n... argued they turn to the example of African Americans because of slavery and a modern day racism knew all about how everyday life was dangerous and found refuge in pleasures of the body like dance and music\nOn the essay is actually offensive for the way it essential lives as African Americans associating them with the body over the mind with sexuality and heat and there's some these false stereotypes dated back to the ideology of slavery\nMiller was rightly criticized for example by the African American author James Baldwin who said that the essay infuriated him for its perpetuation of mess\nCurrent I Wonder what you thought of Newman maintenance argument the idea that just the fact of being block somehow can pose Qunu hits the status as he put it\nI completely agree with a ... and the problems um\nWith that article and that is just about the ... the mind and not understanding\nThe reasons why I'm black people may dress all uh I engage in music if a particular way as we've

I graduated from college and decided to just help her do a business plans and help set everything up and so that the post has assigned place\nSo that the mistakes that she made in the past would not happen again so that's how we got stopped it but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business full time was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA lot of people go for the show treatments ... treatments added ... or they will get a facial relaxing one at a spa [noise] that was hardly anything that was in between to offset really really intensive facial treatments where they could heal the skin treat any problems ... problems\nAnd at the same time provide that level of relaxation and also the medical level kind of expertise behind how to treat a skin\nSo many ... how did you get your business or just I mean how did you get sponsored I\nWhat ten fashion function people in ... because obviously they want new new new from the point in fashion so I simply just told anyone who listened I'm into I can announce I'm I'm just going to be the best cell phone as well and I told everyone not like the few months leading up to it\nAnd sure enough by the time we open to people were talking about it before we even opened\nI also painted the front of the ... bright pink and right now so I'm coming soon [laughter]\nHelp house and like all of these things I did like is that it was twenty four twenty five without even thinking if I went back and look to the is a case study the ... of how to launch round I invited very specific goals instruction to come and get the nouns done\nWe have to persuade a culture of people that ... was it gets to ... you know this isn't ten years ago now not was not cold\nJust off even before that before you were convincing people getting influences teach embrace the work that you were doing what about the practical in terms of finding the money to get started says you have a new bike\nProbably like eight ground of styling money um a friend of mine lent me Seventeen run that she inherited from my ... a wealthy\nFrench she just got this inheritance was all I Want to go to India for four months I'm going to give you this money because I Believe in ... when I get Michael on a joke [laughter] um you know she really trusted Maine it's my first ever experience of the woman helping another woman financially\nAnd in fact the men who are Harris distance I Believe they make about the same as a female Harris assistant in Singapore so based on my understanding all\nThat kind of animals are eight so they make the same when they get to senior level name some famous female hairdressers\nRight around me off the top you had it's very difficult to do I don't really know chance to to to do and so there is a good question and really I I I Love this kind of vendor yeah is that I just feel so passionate about this because it's reflective of so many industries that the very both him\nMen and women all on a level playing field for if you go out I should go up it changes as you go with the tea yeah\nVery very few women putting\nYes this is something that I notice as well\nFor hair actually if a style as as I had a director level whether they are female or male doesn't make a difference in the amount that we pay for them and uh it doesn't make a difference in the amount that they bring home I've got friends while personally and does industry and it's more about the level of expertise and you're right that in terms of makeup and hair\nWe do see that Islam is dominated especially in the fashion industry strange needle in the beauty industry we don't see that many men in fact I have had zero in the last nine years of applicants who apply to be a therapist\nSo I think by the fact that there is a very very tiny fraction all next to norm males in this industry it might be a little bit sleeping to say that is the cause they're women that's why they're paid low maybe you're right that is very difficult to pay\nAbove market wages for the technicians for doing it but if it's a male technician who is doing a job\nI Believe the pay would be the same as a woman if you know if we compare but as we go up the boardroom yes there is more men but when it comes to small businesses versus a big now to national corporation I think that the game is a very different and\nI Would like to think that women are given very very far\nApart unity in Singapore at least in the beauty industry somebody when you look back at your career yeah what do you consider to be your biggest say and how you recover from it\nWas just going to sound so whacked by just don't believe in this whole ... thing come on and now I'm being serious I actually have ... ... is a celebration of salary because I like John ... now my ... my journey was random ...\nAny of the ... it was a series

Alexander Michigan is the true identity of the supposed consensual robbing tourists that Britain is implicated in the know that they can attack to arrange food is in Moscow\nOkay so I'm really interested in them quite tense as well who's pipe is this where does it go like owned by the city council and it goes to a different part of the slum\nA show of cuts held me by the time it reached its destination it's been so heavily tapped by different call tell us that the supply is limited yeah I can imagine that I have to say I'm a bit of concern view their retrospectively because it must have been\nTense with the with the ... the the standing there looking on that you guys a journalist inspecting the completely legal sets up did you feel like you're in any kind of imminent danger yeah was it really weighed situation and the only way I can really explain it is\nThat's just Kenny he jokes around at one point and he said oh don't worry you're safe with me because I'm the mad that I've got a clip the man that's why it would be yeah\nNo the elected merits like the smell the mayor but he's incredibly well connected in Kibera everybody seems to Kenny and he noticed that people running the cartels and he has a really interesting story\nI'll tell you about that in a moment but first let me tell you about solution Sam is always about the solution tell us\nRight so I mean what he hopes solution at least I'm you remember we visited that cartel controlled well it's a kiosk in Kibera at Iran yeah it was a ... black tank with the people that are coming out the top yet well Kennedy's NGO shelf co has set up its own water kiosks in a slum and these ones are a bit difference\nWe've come to another key ... this one's painted bright blue collar\nVicious a shelf go on the shelf cook your to number three so we have to adjust sick incubate also consider I don't know too much far from the men's side shuffle wherever he goes oh I didn't I was you walk only for less than two minutes to get water\nSo that people don't want to watch him so that you aim is that ... will be within two minutes woke up later\nSo yeah before he had people come from this area and because people are now are queuing for what was going to do\nThis to green pipes to getting out of this building is led by some of this will to yes I have a bustle hair color like clean water flowing out of the pipe yes\n[noise] [noise] [noise] okay\nHow's the country compared to what you can see through\nCan be drink some we can drink water because it's clear I guess\nYeah so it tastes good so we got to try to lead to a jury can hear how much is the most from this kiosk\nThese what these cures\nFor two shootings twin Lucia\nOkay so it's much cheaper than the one we just saw\nYes much cheaper it is very very clean\nHow'd you get exposed to so much more cheaply\nBecause what don't we bought whole what we'd do down you know really deep and then when it comes down to ...\nAt the main site in the Kibera slum shops have drilled deep hole in the ground nearly three hundred meters deep below the water table so they have that other than well it's a source they pump the water up to the surface purified and distributed around some of ... era using a very different methods they says the kinds of it\nIs one thing that you need to understand about this project that look up to the sky because it's a huge blue concrete pill that stretches up about ... fifty meters into the sky yes distributes this guy and on the top of it there is a network of pipes\nYes bigger pipes that religion which by the way this is watching\nBut then at age fourteen offshore life of poverty and petty crime everything changed after he was befriended by Catholic priests in the neighborhood he started going to school and reading books\nMade up both Marcus Garvey I don't know about two ... Rosa Parks\nAnd they became my mentor but I never met I used to talk to them that could be\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf go and it's not a pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was the clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to treat a little before we went up when he sees in our clinic [noise]\nSome people get cholera some people get ... guys would read\nSomeone at the ... had a suggestion\nAnd I'd be a kid like you know what\nOf the woods and by the guy on\nI don't know where the ... you know the rich\nWhen it's dropping you see the ...\nAnd I'm like wow this is a good idea\nThis idea we just want somebody who knew somebody in the community we just sat there and you're like wow indirect let me think about it so let's get the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way and that's where Kenny experience in states is in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people I mean it just doesn't maybe if I think one of them are criticizing how have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes I trust they started cutting you'll pipes yes\nSo that was really terrible so what I did for several of them were really agree on I took my wife or their children\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was lucky them income that's why we're able to survive\nThan these ideally I also went by there is that some times that they send their water we don't say mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they sat down and watch out there this is Kenny\n... to just your field of research is\nSo So Professor ... recently ... son the European nuclear Research Center in Geneva hung on to the Large Hadron collider last week he told a room full of female academics and we're such as a son that it was harder to be hired as a man and woman\nHas to be this dog and all where they say very ... and they just getting in a sense on that\nShow I did the\n... the I Believe everybody should have done before making that distinction\nAnd we have some surprising I find that the\nMain the ... leads the opposite the\nTyler it's easier to if you are ...\nProfessor strewn is speaking to the BBC shortly off to giving his controversial too because in in which he claimed that physics walls in his words built by men and women were less capable of the subject diamond\nWell he's since been suspended from his post in his comments have been can dent in the left has signed by some one thousand six hundred scientists from around the world\nDon't suggest Wade is a physicist at imperial college here in London she was in the room when ... gave his talk\nI think everyone was quite shocked the thing that I found the most damaging and the thing that I have thought about that myself too it's just that he was talking to a room full of ... such as and he was basically having that room for the valley career such as they need that because they were women and that they wouldn't get any way going forward because the therapy that the that just kept going forward because if tokenism\nAnd the reason that the ... might have been stunned into silence is because\nThat was very very tenuous correct thoughts everything that you do in science is a kind of short time contract journalists three or four years post\nOn at the end of that you have to be recruited again and interviewed again and come forward before a panel that could include someone like this professor so you're very wary of speaking up and and being attuned to someone who might make any trouble\nPeople will say well it's free speech he has every right to go up and say these things and the things he quoted for example Oxford University extending exam times offensively to help female candidates in stem subjects these rules things that have happened\nNot fit Entergy stop extension of time because they knew that goes for questioning narrative it at the end not confident enough when they were deciding the questions that that during exams\nSo this wasn't saying goes a less able\nAnd I think that this kind of thing when a senior professor comes in and says you know you all intellectually and ferrier that would only make them less confident\nSo the only reason for it they're supposed to give them the fat chance because they realize that they were going through an awful lot of impulse to enjoy about being on a course where that surrounded by boys who have these kinds of opinions and that maybe they needed to get them if either a ...\nD sense in the scientific community that there is a bit of pushback from perhaps none of the sudden generational men generally\nWho are bitter about\nSeeing women being given preferential treatment in the in the process of trying to make the field more representative women for example he will so I think gave the example professors dream of Melbourne University offering women only clauses in stem subjects and also advertising math positions only for women\nI've never experienced that incessantly and the kind of food out about this event that people who have been really angry and really saying oh yeah this is completely right\nAh people either with absolutely no academic affiliation anymore or people who work within this one particular area of high energy particle physics\nSo I don't know what the ... area of theoretical particle physics has a really hard time in recruiting women and it's and in that sense has done these things I mean I Can't comment on that\nBut I Would say that the men that I've encountered have been incredibly supportive of initiative to encourage more women to to participate and to be retained within science\nSo he's not representatives anyway I genuinely do not believe he's representative I think unfortunately these kinds of opinions give voice to an awful lot of angry Charles online you seem to really really like getting\nWhat about things like this I don't know if you had time to read the\nUm ... put forward by about two and a half thousand people walking with him political physics\nFrom all over the world and they will find this very very well versed in life to arguing his points case by case and saying you know this isn't true this isn't true you've gotta go here and look at the states and this has been fined by senior women and men within the failed so I really don't think he is representative I think he might be\nFrom a particular school of thought that type late on the way out in science because the majority of people recognize that diverse teams do you buy the science\nDo you think is worse in science in terms of gender inequality and sexism and the industry than most other fields\nI think that an academic science you have very very weighed Powell relationships that you don't have another field so you'll direct Korea puff is determined by people like this so professors who have ultimate power if you're going to do in your life\nAnd that's all that opinion really really matches the majority of people who are in senior positions are old men because that's what history has done and we've not go to a stage yet where we can change that so\nI think that this bizarre power relationship with an academic science such and he makes these kind of beliefs and ideologies a bit stronger than in other professions\nDon't suggest waited imperial college here in London where women are pushing back Keli Ramirez is this soil microbial ecologists and cofounder of five hundred women scientists it's a grassroots organization that aims to promote diversity in the field\nAnd it was set up just off to the election of President Trump in twenty sixteen today I was twenty thousand people have signed up to its aims last ... years what groups objectives originally political\nNot political it is about creating equity in the sciences it's about all of the collective inequities that women face and that can be from having someone tell you you're a girl so you're not any good at math\nOr are you sure you should be in this class are smart enough to be here and that comes pretty early on through high school and maybe in your early college years once you get into grad school not only are people questioning whether or not you should be there and your intelligence at if you weren't degree has been good enough\nBut then they started to question your leadership skills and whether you can be in charge of students or projects\nAs you move farther into your career there are paid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting support front and signatures as we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges\nIt is an open letter that we wrote ask the women in science asking scientists women and supportive of women scientists to stand together\nAnd change the face of science evidence today\nWe have a signature on the pledge from over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed a pledge\nDo you hope to take this we have\nTo be a fully funded sustainable organization that continue to push\nTo make science open a critic and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists so at five in her room and scientists within America are succeeding and we want to make a five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline that are profiting from the right we can keep moving up and\nKelly Ramirez than what Kelly and talk for just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia\nBut within the rules are just not as visible last week professor don't a strict and became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics a day later another one front says on old won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd professor strict in historic achievement her biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on\nRebecca hit get is a ... in history of science at the University of can't she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it's found a space within the culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy as it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... it wasn't necessarily particularly well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economy easel to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own author or see\nI'm One of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being\nMore dangerous or less serious or less intelligent or whatever because of the way that gender roles of being constructed so we sometimes find women's just domestically being excluded where they may wants to ... I don't\nThink it's because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the ... more authority\nAbsolutely and particularly once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public say so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a mass scale and kind of ... ... it's going out and owning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a uh Korea policy can fall I say a a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing ... societies channels you can publish in\nThat he was then a ... an agent for them\nAnd do we know where is he now well of course he appeared last month on Russian TV a\nBack him Russia alongside he's accused suspects are in the ... case and they make the period I'm Russian TV and claimed that they ... to ... to look at the famous cathedral spy that\nNow obviously that got lost ... events and what's interesting about today and they'll say what's happened last week when the ...\nReleased a light of information about the activities that the G argue it's it's really left that idea of them getting a justice terrorists to Seoul spray ... as a rather thread back story\nWe've been reporting on this story over several months now and one of the remarkable things about it is that there were so many images of both of these men making their way from the airport to solve very of course there is a just a an overwhelming number of CCTV cameras are throughout the country there\nIs it a surprise is considered a failure that if these were really Russian intelligence officers that they were so easy in the end to identified\nI think there is a surprise that they have seen that so much information has been found out in the last few weeks about them and that's of course raises questions about the stand into the jail you operation is\nA an outfit like battling camps which is a grief of investigative journalists they say they have no help from intelligence services that just often using a console says\nIf they can look back coal ... school yearbooks and discover where people lived on ... ... they in fact when so this guy's village in northern Russia to verify from school friends will see look like\nIf they're able to identify them than not does suggest that are at the secret states in Russia hops needs to step up the a level of secrets operations and once that gets away with this kind of thing\nAnd tell us more about building codes and this group of journalists do they have any help from their colleagues Russia\nThey've been working with a website called Russian insight that that has also been working on this case and that they've done some of the lake what\nFor example going to the village of ... in northern Russia to talk to you Mr Ken's school friends and friends of his grandma and they use things like social media they have a sort of community of people who look at that Web sites and contribute\nInformation I have to say there are there are people that rabbits some protests as earlier at Westminster who are accusing battling cats as being the stooges of West and intelligence services\nAnd they argue that hey there's no way they could have just come across a copies of this month ... on the Internet\nI guess the question is now we have supposedly the identity of of these two men ah they're both safely ensconced in Russia are beyond the reach of the authorities in Britain ... well no\nI I think that that is the the big problem for the British authorities it's all very well to identify as suspect that if I suspect is beyond your reach ... chance of having them extradited from Russia\nA than a ... it's very hard to sort of take the case so that it's worth remembering head that obeyed this was
