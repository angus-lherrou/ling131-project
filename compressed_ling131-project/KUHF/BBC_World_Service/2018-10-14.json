works\nThere was a time when the Republican like the late Senator John McCain was willing to work with the late Senator Ted Kennedy to try to legislate for pasta citizenship for many of those already in the United states those bipartisan effort of a thing of the past there is no hard dividing line\nCecilia Munoz was due to the domestic policy in the Obama White house\nIt's a political problem more than a substantive problem we know that\nThere is wide public support for the kind of immigration reform that we attempted to pass in two thousand sixty thousand seven and twenty Thirteen what we don't have is\nThe political will on the Republican side to allow a bill to go through with a series of votes that would amount to a majority of the Democrats and a minority of Republicans in Congress and that is the optical\nAnd she wants to Democrats to acknowledge the strong feelings among those who disagree with some\nI think that requires some willingness to talk about the security and safety and enforcement side of the equation which is quite uncomfortable and I say this as a Latino service is now very uncomfortable issue in my own community because so many terrible things have been done in the name of integration sportsman but their response\nTo the fact that we object to how immigration enforcement is conducted is not to say\nWe should just not enforce the law by the response which can\nGarner support around the country is to say we have to do this differently\n[noise]\nThe other side outside of San Antonio was famous Tex Mex restaurants the city's sixty three percent Hispanic I met George on tuna funded of Hispanic Republicans of Texas and for him it's a method of security we need to make sure\nThat our border is secure\nBecause the ... are polluting our schools and streets will be a ... year old ... and the human traffickers are you know taking advantage of four disadvantage or immigrants\nWe need to make sure that we have a secure border so that\nOur folks that are living through mild three miles from the border feel safe in their own backyard\nGeorgia and tuna found a off Hispanic Republicans of Texas and being that report by James ...\nOf area in southern Germany is holding a regional election later today the Christian social union party is expected to lose its absolute majority and the state for the first time since the Nineteen sixties\nShe is she is controlled Germany's largest state very of virtually uninterrupted for decades is also a policy in angler Merkel's coalition government Christine mountain is a journalist in Munich she joins me now Christine\nThat results of elections in ... used to be a certain to the shift you won every time what's changed\nOn the scene of the morning and the thing is you have um actually I heard a lot of people here they um [noise] I mean and I and generally that the sister party of the at the CPU which is of course I'm getting backers party\nAnd then they didn't do very well and yeah and actually last year so this year and their complaint is really being too and it's hard to win back the brokers that have gone to the right to that sort of pro or rather anti immigration party the icy and and that has angered a lot of people in the middle and that they have I see a serious generally I mean it had\nA an an opinion or nearly a planet majority in the very since Nineteen fifty eight and they've been complacent and I didn't ... I'm sure they didn't think that people would leave the party and the way that they have but it just shows discontent with the current politics burst out on the right on the left eye and Germany\nAnd if the sea as she doesn't get to live with support but it used to all seem to be on on glimmer cools federal government\nBut let's see if he has a sister part of the city is of course in the coalition if their if their strength has weakened into the area that weakens the strength of the ... and of course the government and they are the the AT T do have a few government ministers in place wanted him is um or the or for Hussein interior minister\nWho is also being instrumental in and and and dissenting vote hurts and making them to seek other alternatives that than a few Russians on scandals and the stair during the election campaign\nAnd um people it makes them feel very nervous and if their popularity under support is diminishing and it will also make things more difficult for medical it's not impossible I might really shake up her ... censorship sorry\nOkay thinks you Christine uh can I introduce rub child needs ... highly and round up ... up following the story what what'd you make of this\nI'm curious to know if you can tell us a bit more about um how the migration debate has a really you know colored the discussion around these political parties in their um lack of support or or\nI'm more support sort of garnered as a result\nOf the migration debate is absolutely essential to this\nAnd take out um Fifteen is you know and I'm going back ... lost her ed refugees into the country I Want to know people were delighted I remember being at the at the train station when they were coming in and people were applauding them as it came off the train but a lot of people really weren't very happy about it and so\nAt it because of the politics at of the the main parties people have been moving over to seek other alternatives and you have people who are very unhappy that immigration is she going to the far right parties ... very at on the immigration and on on the market one\n... and and [noise]\nAnd you are the there's there are alternatives in Bavaria there's also another a spender parties from the sea is you just hire they ...\nThey're not quite as as a radical has the um our state and a lot of people are going there but you also have people who in the middle who feel disenfranchised by the sea su so they are also a they're going further left they've gone and massively to the greens and the greens actually stand in this election to be the big winners\nAnd if I currently at about Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen percent and pose and they could be the second son was parked in the very up for the first time\nRunner I can really you wanted to jump in here ... I was just such a speaking to the very front in Germany a couple of days ago and she was looking actually about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green policy of you know you're just there sure the foreign minister from ten years ago the rather sort of ... this is the role of the more radical fundamentalists starts with green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I Would have actually it's often just look at different they the Green Party they have two very charismatic leader or they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know there\nAre anti racist I mean I end up part of a large movement in Germany I mean it was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up so they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment\nYou know pro sort of a you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are are more interested in that kind of she may politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see us you've had for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they miss the humane policy and politics that used to be and not those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\n[noise] and what it is because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nIt's divided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in and one of the people who are doing very well particularly pensioners is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so to speak [noise] they're also worried about the loss of\nAnd their their sense of German is over there in us you know their culture they're afraid at part of the thing that the ... they say they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries on to this is a a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor and the color on defense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James ... from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with this topic of immigration that's the last speaker was George ... founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant what's your take on that I did I thought it was particularly ridiculous\nI mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um\nA cautious maybe according to Transparency International one in four people around the world admits to pay a bribe when accessing a public service in the last twelve months the organization has launched a future against corruption will dismantle does inviting Eighteen to thirty five year olds\nAround the world to submit ideas for new ways to fight corruption and I'm pleased to say that I'm joined by two guests down the line Casey Kelso runs Transparency International policy and advocacy to we'll hear from him\nIn a moment but first that speak to friends is a dean ... who's one of the organizers of the youth will that I just mentioned\nFrom Cisco good morning welcome to weekend\nWhat you want to achieve from this what do you think that you can offer a solution here\nCan morning well the idea behind the future against corruption of war it was to give young people around the world the opportunity to become agents of change and half their ideas be herds\nWe wanted to give them a platform to express their ideas but also to be able to connect with each other for them to know that there's others out there just like themselves who wants to fight for a future\nWithout corruption so it was really about all the gene that young people today are the leaders of tomorrow and if we empower them to stand up against corruption today they will have the tools to shape a fair a future\nLet me introduce you to rubbed ... highly who's with me in the studio here in London ... you'll book takes a similar approach may be at a younger age but there's a there's a definite connection here\nSure some anti corruption children's book by buying the sequel a jot images coming out later this year which focused primarily on integrity um I wrote the books because I really wanted us to have a conversation with\nYoung children about how to be accountable to some of the nation to globe 'em and beyond that you know I've gotten some critique from people about the books and they say well why are you focusing on children\nUm they can't change policy and yes precisely but children have the capacity to change practice and for me sometimes changing practice\nUm is more important than cheating foot of the high level policies because quite often there's lots of policies and regulations on the books about how to enforce anti corruption I'm I'm actions\nBut a those are ultimately an uninformed um and so we can change the value systems across the globe about what it is that we actually valued devalue honesty to be value integrity between value\nUm you know people living lives that are that are accountable than perhaps we can enforce those policies much more meaningfully and so that's what the intention of the book so it's great to see that you guys are now targeting I'm Eighteen to thirty five year olds which is an important demographic\nI'm In the scourge against corruption\nFrancesca is neither based on fact to expect young people to fire the flag around the corruption when the grown ups of set up a world where they either blend in all ...\n[noise] yeah but you know corruption is a major threat to the CIA people as well and their development in terms of access to education and employment for example and many other people are forced to pay bribes in order to get ahead so\nI think it's really all about a change in attitude that's why it's so important to educate young people for a very early stage so that they can learn that corruption does not have to be the norm\nThat can learn about their rights and see how much better society is without corruption\n'em and only then can we really build the movement of people who challenged corruption and even resisted and not become part of the system that grown ups have battled for them and it is easy to feel powerless as an individual against the system\nAnd and that's why also with the future I guess corruption awards we want and the winner is to have the chance to work directly with our local offices in their country to support them with implementing their idea\nWhat kind of young people to live\n[noise] I mean you know if young people maintain the status quo there will be no change and young people especially a more open to social change they use a lot of ways of communication to connect with each other\nAnd they're at tech savvy so there's a lot of potential and that and I think it's really about empowering them and giving them a role in the fight against corruption and it's really about you know trying and and of course failure is an option but complacency and indifferent or not\nThat's bringing Casey Kelso Casey you run Transparency International policy and advocacy to you know I'll still there whether corruption is on the rise what do you say\nUh yes I think we see of starting by your decade or more ago that he's globalized so instead of\nJust petty corruption and there's a grand corruption system or a criminal service industry that of\nAccountants and lawyers people who set up a show companies and these huge dirty clothes have gotten larger and larger which means that a lot of the fines get larger and larger and there's no Google policemen there's no there's no natural enemy of these quick ... financial flows that go from London too\nAfrica or back and forth worth or Singapore Panama there's a lot of money that sloshing around up there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about ready big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah that um I Know well I'm a writer author in Liberia and talked about at the local level which is extremely important\nAt the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure are banks or or a lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts plenty billions of dollars that go into ...\nYou're taking a laundry or into a contract so one of the biggest of their schemes whereas in Latin America were billions of dollars were spent ... rope told you you wanted to come in here\nYeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples out because I mean although Transparency International has that corruptions perception index with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've gotten billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through you know invading taxes through transfer pricing\nI'm mostly from Poland foreign multinationals and you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index which is more evidence base has more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tense stance international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa or the other the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that I was eating China that sorry I did meet John it you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of the series of high profile arrest for this time ... who was the head of into pole and they seem to being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAnd innocence what China's been doing particularly in the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national see position commission is what you might call auntie transparency this this huge crackdown it's very much the product\nOf a north ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and spicy be putting the frightened there's a large numbers of well off people not just officials but movie stars even the famous Chinese movie star who was\nAnd hidden away for three months until she came out in the great packs us tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very ... kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey well from my site or I I think in part to an atmosphere [noise] Casey this is about ... can you hear me just try again yeah\nAmnesty International called the ... the national supervision finishing the systematic threat to the human rights in China which we agree with that ...\nAnd people without trial without access to a lawyer for six months or having an organization that you can't appeal hire them to report is probably not the way to go ... could you want to kind of hands I'm\nSorry I think ... little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I I I was a question for all of you um and in fact rubbed till\nWe hear so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world do the work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from before the transfer uprising or less a financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parents beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe\nColombia and author and journalist Hector Abad speaking to me that about his latest book the from listening to that Roberto ... round up rope tell I saw you lost particularly when a hectare mentioned politicians\nYeah he's a politicians don't read I mean my first response was that was perhaps politicians need to read novels more to be better politicians and be more humane and their policies\nUm that's the beauty of of literature and the beauty of people who can create a campus of characters that really bring the human condition to the fore and listening to him talk just made me so so enthused and excited but\nAgain I I think my response about politicians not reading is that they do need to read more and then you can read novels so that they can become more humane in their policy making Rona\nSome politicians do read we should remember that President Obama actually it was a great novel reader and there's a wonderful conversation stood on line\nUp with him talking to the Pulitzer Prize winner Marilyn Robinson about ... ... in fact the situation that the president being the interviewer and a novelist thing the interviewee but it's also something about land that's very contemporary in China too\nMany peasants being moved off the land there to the cities and one of the major reasons they don't want to go in many cases if they lose their right to have that little patch of land that they had that in the countryside and for Chinese workers it's still very dear to their hearts rather like Colombians it seems to have some patch of land that's really the\nRub tell this land the land issue is universal isn't it\nIt is absolutely I mean I'm across the continent of Africa where you have\nA large multinational corporations taking over large fleets of land and communities being very very up in arms about that and trying to hold their government accountable\nUm is a testament to the fact that land as culture land is um is everything about who you are as a human being um and the the the tendency to to sort of negate that is really problematic\nAnd everyone now moving to the cities and leaving the countryside behind I'm\nOut in the countryside in China one ... is that his grandparents and young children who left in the villages well the study buddy men and women are going out to build a city is so that's another intergenerational problem that China's going to have to solve\nOkay wrote to run away will come back to show the but just listen to this town in Kent in southern England has become an unlikely

the other is the little chapel\nOn the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is he why she's so important\nHe was the archbishop here in ... the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he\nWas he was really be loved and respected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing his life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave a Sunday sermon directing himself specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and the moral ordered to go out and and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities so who killed him\nWell it was for the most part people from you know on the government side the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out that there was a growing left his movement here actually\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses

University of ... spent lots of time studying the beliefs and behaviors of lucky and unlucky people\nTrapped research around about ... percent the population think extremely lucky and about I think that certainly unlucky and most of the ... somewhere in between but we do have\nThoughts when your papers in their mind how lucky you unlocked we are and it starts young you know you can go into schools and children they'll be able to identify the lucky unlucky kids in the classroom\nSo this is something which is something to do that psychology is an ad find keep this notion emotion rational or being lucky and I'm like\nThe idea of luck tied to something that we've been talking about and they spoke on Sunday of magical thinking\nConsider yourself lucky Iran lucky is a form of magical thinking because clearly crossing their fingers ... probably doesn't influenced the well directly however what my research shows is is does it affect your mentality of psychology your beliefs\nYou have to choose and they then have an impact on your life\nSo lucky people are more successful than unlucky people they do get the policies and chat with people end up getting job office or they do their best to in life because they're far more positive and optimistic drives them for so you know we're white it's rational to be irrational isn't\nRight okay so there is kind of such a thing as lucky unlucky people because lucky unlucky people\nBehave in different ways and all that full influence that lives in different ways it is that right yeah I mean my research I spent a decade looking extremely lucky unlucky thinks about thousands of them\nAnd we can see the lucky people were far healthier they tend to have more long lasting relationships or they can earn more money or they tend to ... so in that sense the FBI luckier than the average that showed that they were doing things of unconsciously Craig that good luck because why they're thinking the way they're behaving\nSo yes there is a psychology there is a science to lock\nHalf amazing so what kinds of principles when these lucky or unlucky people living their lives by some kinds of things where they doing differently to each other\nOne of the key principles is that they are more open to opportunities so they tend to have a gold Israel will do in terms of being happy and healthy and what's happened but how they were going to get that well they're very open to different groups through certainly met somebody up ... seats and she said well that's an interesting personal keep in touch with that person or that they will go along with that routes\nWhen I'm not a whole are often stuck in a rough that go one way which they intend to be successful in relationships will help for whatever the case and they stick with that no matter what happens so that kind of flexibility behavioral flexibility is very pull\nThis some experiments that you have done the kind of showed what the differences between the people who identify as white cat out of power space experiments so for example might have to fix or a newspaper and it might be opportunities in that newspaper a big ... tell the experiments you've seen this and when a hundred pounds\nAnd the lucky people tend to acquire a large what's called attentional spotlight they're very relaxed and so they literally see more of the world was spotless opportunities and go out like at my money\nAnd give them the money and all that lucky but still\nThe unlucky people\nAre anxious about themselves right small spotlight the printing don't see those opportunities lucky people say up to ... other like work out well for them and so because of that they're very Brazilians went bad things happen they will bounce back because this underlying belief in the future good things will will come about\nUnlucky people exactly the opposite pessimistic for example if you give people the scenario such as you walk into a bank and invest the robot like Oregon\nAnd hit you in the arm you're lucky you I'm lucky you've seen massive differences and which one\nFor the worst slums that resilience the lucky people going oh my goodness well I'm lucky day 'cause it my hawks in my head just by all you know if I Need some time off work to be afraid lucky break the unlucky people go while you even asking the question I've just been shown me all the lady and I'm like yes\nIt's very simple experiments often you quite profound insight into people's different mind\nSome in some ways even comes foods are at the beginning of this program we heard how magical beliefs or sometimes the result of our brains making fools connection and getting things from\nThe richest reset seem to show that believing you're lucky could become self fulfilling and actually make you more lucky off the

that we use and\nThe organizations have dismissed those claims leaving many to question the evidence underpinning that Bloomberg reports but whatever the truth is also the instant it is an option to certainly to ask whether such a hack could\nHappen and just how secure out all the supply chains of crucial computer equipment technology correspondent mark world has been covering the story here at the BBC\nWas the cover story in Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnd it involved a Amazon apple search you the company's us warships the department of defense enable oil companies organizations that we're using video serve is made by a company called elemental technologies ... and was interested in that company ... getting video this was a few years ago twenty Fifteen I think\nI'm an elemental had to come up with some hunger itself whether it was great to compression video [noise]\nUm the servers the elemental was using were made by another company called super microcomputers\nOn these computers were assembled in China surprising given you know trying to domination of the\n... electronics manufacturing markets and apparently while Amazon was doing some due diligence on the technology is making sure they would test advertised apparently they tripped over a tiny chip the size of a grain of rice that'd be added to the ... as\nI was being made in the Chinese factories\nAnd the claim is that the tiny chip has a little ... that effectively can sample anything passing through that sort of and has a back door that can lead you into any organization that um is using those machines and that's what's Bloomberg was claiming this week\nA huge ... which was then rapidly denied by Amazon and apple that's right yeah I mean\nWe're both on the quarter while in generally with those very large tech firms you get really wishy washy statements they hate to say anything definitive\nBut that what was striking about these statements how was how detailed they were the language using them an apple boldly said there is no truth in this story Amazon was a little at one point so definitive but said it had investigates as well and was really struggling to understand how Bloomberg could reach the conclusions\n... for us to sit here and pontificate as to whether the Bloomberg ripple it's true or not I mean is there anything we know about\nHow likely it is to be true because the brain by half said they put a hold of evidence together of say that I Would have been very strongly rejected by the technology company\nThat's right yeah I think Bloomberg said he'd been investigating for twelve months have Seventeen insiders including former spies as those people who look apple and Amazon certainly if you are a nation state then yeah and you could do something like this they should just be perfect he would because\nYou know it's a growing area video and if it was that ideal by deal with an yet absolutely you'd want to do it but equally I talked to quite a lot of security companies and they say that you know there's been a big sea change in the white those nation states operate the getting less and less about the big ticket to the operations and that's certainly what this would have been because\nYou're talking about involving people in a factory you talking about changing the production line you're talking about a lot of people it's a lot of moving parts that to coordinate and China may have\nA good handle on the loyalties of those people but you got to think at some point someone something similar would get out and it would be more obvious that this had happened\nAnd I and I think that the change that we've seen these ... those are those nations and outgoing from which will still the campaigns\nThat tend to use the kinds of techniques that you see from you know just your standard organized criminal because that makes it much easier to hide where's this is you know it's fairly obvious way you can point the finger if something images from a Chinese factory with sponsorship on it\nAnd that's why as whatever as all isn't going on in this particular story at least it's not about unity to think about vulnerabilities that could be in the supply chain and to ask a space quite an important question ... whatever's going on here how feasible it would be any way at the level of manufacturing to put a little surveillance\nChip into a device ship that device and then have that chip active I when it said put it into a server and the United states or the u._k. or wherever\nYeah but that's one of the Jewish aspects about the story is that a ... I don't think Bloomberg said this is chip it been turned on I think it was it sort of they they think they go ahead of the cove and they got it before the\nUm the sponsors of whatever ... activates it but I think some technical analysis that did look at the evidence removed they'd put forward and he said that yeah if you were going to do if you if you if you pick this both on the circuit board the plane but I didn't like to be a great place to do it because it it did seem to that data or is it flowing across you know from one possible to another\nSo yeah it's feasible and certainly the\nUm there's been warnings from the FBI about supply chain attacks and we've seen some very successful ones happen certainly for self on the software packages but less on the hot but\nIt's certainly one of those things that the bad guys know about and trying to get ... get into a small change because then used in fact one wants to use a bit of software and it takes care of the distribution for you and you know they can they can be very effective but at the moment ... which is wasting not definitive wood and on both sides as competing claims\n... certainly all that says mark ward talking to me at air on\nWhat out how to make the mess of things and Internet of even more things because the things need to communicate with the other thing that's how it goes now that ... activity is white us for it to be why this unique devices to have a little antenna an aerial to transmit to receive the signal\nWell things have moved on since I use the metal ... hanging as my collar area if the guy because now

for example just simply was the voice come on and to Naples this world we need to have an Dennis ... communications for too much placed everywhere and ...\nAnd sometimes even transparency visible\nIt can encourage them to help people actually interacting\nWell the technology is surprisingly simple it's very much like you cheap live or Facebook Live or Instagram liable that same streaming software platforms but if you want to interact with the film you come to the bloody minded to old and then we have the stream and\nAt different points when the film you will see questions come up and all those points you'll be able to give your opinions\nYou think the plan that film and technology Lincoln ... well\nOf the things that changed with the advent of video streaming video on demand leads kind of

when it's been looking at ... and using throwing based scouting and to build virtual environments that people can cover I think\nThat that I really liked the idea of ... I can understand more about why they decided to make a whole feature film with the live stream to submit comments and interact with other audience then that one of the stuff they we found is Matt and sat down with me and never had to ... to explain\nSo the bean loads of experiments with films and TV around interactivity where you change the story or you change your character does\nWindow interested in the actual instead what happens is that the whole film is narrated by Harold who is um a contentious objector from World war one and she bites you to share things with him so we are creating spoke up\nFor all be was in the cinema and online there was a truck window into which you can make submissions and it will also be posted on Facebook so that was the jobs for people who just want to chat about the film in real time so there was a sense in which is a sort of a collective conversation is going on that is Paul tolls and alongside the film\nYou in the film on the line I Am interested to see different reaction from potentially people around the well\nYeah the we've always been fascinated by how as a society we either in or out of trying to change the world\nWe started our research by looking at conferences objectors in ... when I was astonished to learn just how brave those people had to be in order to follow that part of it\nWould be fascinating to see how these questions resonate differently for people in this country compared to people who come from around the world\nI left him off questions from the south I normally and only ... everyone around me I'm too do you think you know this could be distracting the\nPlaces in which you were invited to interact of very carefully chosen we're looking to keep the cinematic experience and then at the same time to find these moments where the film just opens up and the ... is bad for you to to to share something\nNow I Want to give away anything in the failed that maybe you could give me a ... you\nKnow we follow astray as she tries to get inside British Army base to carry out an action that she thinks is is really important\nAnd that really wasn't giving away that he revealed in the right to Harold would be bringing the comments into mission in the film somehow to last night went off to get ready for hassles I stuck around to see what else I could find out\nAnd just started that reach right in preparation for the last several million they turn this week and I can see through the window at the studios will set around the table with ... someone getting to sneak can't have like a preview of the thing\nSo that we all that is the cost that ... thing for a buddy of mine that's playing across them off this weekend so I couldn't believe that you know these people well a lost there what do you make of this approach this project\nYes I Do now but I said well for many as ...

Q. to schizophrenia depression autism alcohol is an extra version agreeable nets and like the list goes on 'em\nThat seems to me to speak a lot to the power of what ever is in your body when you were born and even though we pay so much attention and it's been so much money and put so much thought into what happened after you're born\nIf twins who are separated at birth kind of all those things you know extra version an odd to thinking of all those things in common I I don't know it seems like a lot it's hard wired has the team to you\nOkay I'm actually a very cranky skeptic of an awful lot of what has come out of his field term behavior genetics both from twin studies or adoption studies or as you said like the the Super Bowl and the whole field identical twins adopted Riley light and rancor United [noise]\nSo there's lots of issues that come up here okay so first off some of these links to genetics to Herod ability um are in fact quite strong probably into version extra versions of the biggest one out their food so are we genetically\nDetermined to be introverted or extroverted what you've seen some cases is what would be an indirect effect a large percentage of the ... version extra version is in fact carry genetically by height\nTall people are treated better\nTall people are considered more attractive tall people become more confident and extroverted and it turns out a huge percentage of that intra version extra version linkage to genes in fact is mediated by a much more mundane thing oh she has something to do with like how long\nA supplemental sensory stimulus\nTen seconds ago to why humans evolved a way they are rather than being ... everything in between you spend enough time with that\nAnd you know that concept of free will start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers but in terms of that I come out as what's turned to hard determinist I don't think there's a shredder free will help there\nUm I think free will his what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge\nAbout what biology has to do with behavior\nWe've spent the last couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is whoa I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\n... I had no idea that an epileptic seizure\nIs a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child has a lot of trouble learning to read rather than being lazy and an motivated has the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at\nThe sheer percentage of what we know\nAbout the biological shaping of our behavior [noise]\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since she woke up this morning and all that has been happening is\nThis endless march of oh I had no idea of biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is and then some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day either you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my stance or at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking and western values and judgments and it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just to keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to win sister was free will while you've lost your upper teeth It's MORNING instead of your lower ones\nWell the story of Ralph Nader is really one uh about some of the dangers of innovation that sometimes innovation designed to help you ends up helping your direct competitors even more so\nThat's Adam Winkler a law professor at UCLA an author of the new book we the corporations how American businesses wind their civil rights that case around whether individual consumers were entitled to know the drug prices that pharmacies went all the way to the Supreme Court\nNow of course NATO was trying to help the consumers of the drug price information not the pharmacist and he went to the Supreme Court saying that even though I'm a I'm not representing pharmacist Mike ... the consumers have a right to hear the the mess\nIs that the pharmacist will say uh and the Supreme Court agreed and establish what's known as the listeners writes theory of the first amendment and the ideas that speech is protected regardless of the identity of the speaker so long as it's a valuable tool listeners\nIt with a huge victory for Nader and his hot shot and legal team\nThey not only won they won big in fact only one justice dissented\nIt conservative justice William Rehnquist Rehnquist worried that this might seem like a victory for the little guy that's not really what it was what it was with free speech for corporations at a time when the government frequently banned are severely curtailed advertisements for things like liquor\nAnd this case established a new standard\nIt would lead Rehnquist wrote to quote active promotion and prescription drugs liquor cigarettes and other products he warned that before we knew it pharma companies will be selling a sleeping aids he would be a disaster\nWe knew a little place we're tossing and turning have given way to sleeping\nWith sleepless nights ...\nAnd you can help you get there\nAmazingly Rehnquist had seen the future and it was filled with sleep Bates probably not what Ralph Nader was hoping for\nAnd in fact I'm the head of Ralph Nader's organization Public Citizen recently wrote an article calling for the entire line of First Amendment cases extending rights to corporations to be overturned\nLike it's a way he's really saying is the victory I won I Wish it had never happened\nIt's a very a poignant version of constitutional buyer's remorse\nThat remorse no doubt is compounded because the Virginia pharmacy case turned out to pave the way for another case a two thousand ten case called Citizens United which allowed corporations to contribute to political campaigns during elections\nAdam Winkler they UCLA law professor says its Citizens United was a case that extended the civil rights of corporations even ordinary Americans were not huge fans of the notion that corporations needed civil rights\nCorporations are people in my friends to raise taxes I of course they are every big corporations are and also when it goes to people\nSo that was presidential candidate Mitt Romney at the two thousand and I have an Iowa State fair\nAnd his assertion was ridiculed the clip was played over and over probably to the chagrin of his campaign staff but in some sense Romney was not too far off the mark corporations have all sorts of rights you may not know about\nWell it turns out that like women and minorities were left out of the original promise of we're the people\nCorporations to have been fighting for equal rights for over two hundred years and of course corporations don't risk their lives the way civil rights marchers did and there's no moral equivalency between those various movements but corporations have been fighting for two hundred years to win the fundamental rights and the constitution\nAnd today have nearly all the rights that a corporation could be a imagine to want a freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom against unreasonable searches and seizures so um most of our most fundamental rights do apply to corporations thanks to a two hundred year effort by corporations to win those rights\nThrough landmark Supreme Court rulings\nAnd you've written about how innovative over a long period of time corporations have been with the law on getting it reinterpreted and and you particularly highlight the fourteenth amendment can you talk about like what the fourteenth amendment is and what happened with it\nThe fourteenth amendment was adopted after the civil war to protect the rights of the newly freed slaves but I'm about Fifteen Years later I'm the southern Pacific railroad company launched this remarkable series of test case is saying that corporations should be protected by the fourteenth amendment to\nAnd ah the story is one of the most disturbing in American constitutional history oh the southern Pacific railroad hired a lawyer who was a former drafter a one time drafter of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd he told the justices that the framers had intended to protect corporations not just the newly freed slaves in the fourteenth amendment\nTurns out that historians now know that that lawyer lied to the Supreme Court um but nonetheless the court ultimately agreed and did extend those rights to corporations ...\nYou're listening to innovation have I'm Karen Miller I'm Talking with Adam Winkler he's a law professor at UCLA he's author of the new book we the corporations how American businesses won their civil rights\nAnd I said at the beginning that uh the little guy has sometimes gotten hurt by a cases that have ultimately piled up more and more civil rights on the corporate side um but that is not always true when the stories that you tell and and you talk about this\nUm men in the early Nineteen hundred to own enemies in part\nAnd he actually use the power that corporations had gained\nA to protect his own civil rights ah so the man who own the amusement park or with African American and he was sued by folks in Virginia who were saying and this and we don't want all these African Americans coming into our neighborhood to go to this amusement park\nUm and the owner was actually able to defend himself because corporations had such extensive rights or do you wanna talk about that case\n[noise] sure it was a case involving like you say an amusement park for African Americans are in Virginia back at around the turn of the century and the local neighbors sued or trying to put the amusement park out of business\nBecause they said on the African Americans were not allowed to buy the land that the amusement park was located on okay\nWas that in the law the average or not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans couldn't bought a land it was there were restrictions in the deed of the land of head you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant a common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor of the amusement park saying that uh the amusement park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm a and a ...\nHighlights and interesting and unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that in many ways it's the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights just like almost anything else in American history\nTo go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people couldn't you argue and I I I guess corporations' probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and um\nTheir interests you know when they fight for their interests whether it's talking about terrorists or whatever it is they are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable to share those profits um\nIsn't that in some you know I think you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that\nA reasonable way to look at things that corporations are collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nThat is exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history and defer all the controversy over corporate personhood Citizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that\nIf you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations\nWe find that most of those cases the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people who end up people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't\nLose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation one Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law\nIn health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that there isn't a that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interest really should be a recognized the the people who contribute the money or the people who contribute the labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs\nGet active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they don't want to finance companies that that make a weapons like the air Fifteen ah we've seen Patagonia sue the Trump Administration over a national monuments and protection of national monuments\nI just wonder if there's going to be a whole new crop of these cases that tests the power of corporations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
