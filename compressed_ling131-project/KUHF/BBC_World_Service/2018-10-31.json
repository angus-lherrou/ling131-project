Washington bureau I asked him why he was just taken the step now rather than any other point during this bloody war\nI think there's a lot of external circumstances that have converged at this moment I think the edge mock shows you fear does have some impact on thinking in Washington certainly in Riyadh\nI think the reputational costs of the Yemeni war now to the Saudi regime at a moment of enormous stress is has to be taken into consideration I think the most recent un report\nDiscussing ... a much worse than than situation humanitarian crisis is going to be exacerbated or in the coming weeks also have to factor or thinking as does the fact that the U.S Congress\nHas been going increasingly impatient with our continuing support for the the Saudi coalition in the air strikes do the sales of of ... and they just tickles support and I think all of these elements\nLend a certain sense of urgency to the ministry which is most welcome as more than ... said\nBut they're not just sites at the moment has great ... of the crown prince Mohammed bin ... previously\nWhile I Would like to think that's true I don't know that's the case but I certainly hope that we do believe we have an opportunity here to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia are continuing support for the government for the regime for the royal family in exchange for some very careful and thoughtful decision being made on some of the crises that Saudi can help resolve\nTo how do you see this conflict or coming to an end I mean the United states or could hold up on supplies sent to Saudi Arabia for instance\nWe could I'm not sure that would be the the magic bullet that would solve this if you will um I Do think Martin Griffiths plan that he is has outlined for you hear this afternoon is certainly very welcome and I think that's something the United states should and will be supporting and I hope we'll do it very publicly and very energetically because I think that this is going to be one of the final opportunities\nTo put the parties in the same room and have them sit face to face and decide how they get out of this terrible mess to both of them all in principle parties in fact are responsible for creating\nDo see Iran that being prepared to deliver the who says to the negotiating table\nI'm not certain Iran could if it even more than a too I think that the uh the Hutus are very happy to take support from Iran and they've been receiving some in the south support and some other support from the Iranians but they've never been beholden to ... which is something that was engineered a in Iran either so that these will\nAgain they'll make their own calculus on how to benefit themselves in this situation and I think if I'd love to see Iran be helpful and they suggested they can be and I know they're talking to some members of the EU\nSo I Hope those talks will advance the process that Martin Griffiths is engineering himself\nBecause even if you do resolve the immediate complex\nIn Yemen are you still have those two regional power Saudi Arabia and Iran ... each other didn't you\nWhat you certainly do and and that's one of those issues now is it Yemen increasingly becoming a an arena in which Saudi Arabia in Iraq and go toe to toe if you will over their rivalry and I think that is one of the enormous consequences\nFor you I mean which is clear right in the middle of this and we need to get this over with so that is Saudi Arabia and Iran can decide other ways to to to figure out among themselves between themselves how the region is going to go forward\nI bet that he referred to Iran to be reputational damage perhaps to Saudi Arabia in crown prince Mohammed bin some man but has that we should be reputational damage to the United states because of its involvement in this conflict\nI think that's a consideration I think that we are now increasingly in publicly associated with the coalition and this behavior and its conduct in the consequences\nOf the way it is ... is is prosecuted this war in Yemen are we are the ... for a supplier of weapons and that just took a sport for the Saudi coalition I think that is something we would like to be able to walk away from we can do that if we can persuade the Saudis in the ... and the other is to figure out a way\nTo compromise sufficiently to win the war find out what we can do to make that easier for them to achieve what is it will weaken constructively play that will allow them to make the tough decisions I think that can be our role I Hope that we're going to be doing in the coming weeks\n[noise] but ... says
