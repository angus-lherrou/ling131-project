midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night where here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom Steyer is best known these days where his knee to impeach organization\nIt's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact party leaders seemed to be running the other way\nBut let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for her post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line great to be here so ... as we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas\nDoing a rally for a man he used to call lion head but now he calls him this [laughter]\n\nBeautiful Ted Texas Ted Amanda please explain what's happening here [laughter] well\nTetris needs to win his election against a very charismatic Beto O'Rourke and Trump is still popular in Texas so he is following his pride he is letting Trump campaigned for him and he is forgetting the fact that Trump during the campaign uh\nBasically accused Cruz's father of assassinating JFK\nAnd talked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean it's a little gross that take cruises willing to just move on and overlook all of us really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump plots it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who doubted him didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nI remember a man or maybe you were also there in Cleveland in the hall when Ted Cruz spoke at the Republican convention and criticize Donald Trump from the podium and was booed off the stage at my how things have changed in the last two years\n[noise] yeah I Do remember that too I mean there was it was an intense Republican primary and I was also there and I remember the bowling and now you know beautiful tad a Trump I think his approval rating in general is up maybe\nA he is headed up for for a it's his approval rating four percent more favorable that unfavorable and you know cruise is not a great campaign or federal rockets out they're racing record amounts of money getting people in Texas exciting and people around the country excited\nAnd in the last debate he went on the offensive against crews and courage is sort of doing whatever he can and we are seeing some of that is just overlooking everything he ever said about Trump and just for getting it happen\nNow here's the thing they don't work has raised a ton of money or more money than I think one report said that President Obama raised\nA at all at one point\nThat tries to enter our country every day now the president didn't say terrorists he said middle Easterners but it's the blending of the language here that sort of adds to the ads for the discomfort or about the way the president is is talking about this issue\nSure there's no question about that and it's not an accident I mean he does this specifically because he knows what that imagery will bring up I mean he is the most bigoted racist president I think that we've had\n'em and he is somebody that is absolutely willing to use all of that kind of imagery because he knows exactly what it will do\nLook he won the Republican primary hands down on this issue of immigration and it was a big reason why he won the presidency and and the way that he did it was not to throw out there and really talk about commonsense\nBipartisan solutions no in fact completely the opposite he used to fear and he used it to ... to bring up these\nThese images to frankly his base many of which are white nationalistic and\nDo not like uh the changes that are going on in this country the demographic changes and President Trump knows that and he's using that to the ... says advantage\nYou know Murray at one of the the the storylines that's been picking up steam lately is the fact that\nLatino voters vote or Latino voter enthusiasm is not nearly as high as people had expected is is this rhetoric and the way the president is talking about immigration in general and the caravan in particular is that what is dampening\nEnthusiasm among Latino voters no\nI think I think it's the contrary and and I I'm not convinced that that is actually true uh what what is out there is that there is a study that ah that\nMy friend I have to do a lot of guys from the national association of Latino elected officials put out there they're having a week to week tracking poll which is very interesting but what it did was\nIt measured the percentage of Latinos who had been contacted by a party or a candidate and it was very high meaning that no party or no candidate had contacted about fifty five percent of Latino voters\nUm as of about two weeks ago but it also measured the intention to vote for Latinos and it was in the mid seventies which is pretty high in the mid term election for Latinos\nSo I think that the the the polls that had been talking about measuring Latino enthusiasm I don't think are right on the mark but I Will say Jonathan we should assume\nAs a party as a Democrat we should assume that those are correct so that we do everything that we can and the next two weeks to make sure that Latinos understand the importance of this election\nTo mobilize them to energize them to get them out to vote but I think that this rhetoric actually does a lot to mobilize Latinos because they see it as a personal attack against them whether they're here with documents or not\nAnd they see it as a personal attack against their families and the community\nSo sir Christina the president President Trump is out there talking about immigration but the former president President Obama is out also on the campaign trail out in Nevada are talking about health care here's what do you have to say I'm today in last\nWednesday night at nine and Houston Public\nMedia news eighty eight seven\nHouston

next guest on television or billboards encouraging Americans to join his effort to impeach President Trump Tom ... is the Democratic party donor and founder and leader of me to impeach\nAnd while need to impeach had six million signatures in his report it to be the biggest voter lists in politics there are plenty of democratic leaders who wish he would just stop talking about impeachment here's Nancy Pelosi\nSo let's focus that on that would not be my plan would not be a plan to charge them and I have enough people on my back to the present level that [noise] you know fine unless that that\nAgain with the information that comes with the demonstration [noise] a temperament that is not to show that the Senate will do the right thing\nAnd then there's former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd if Democrats win the house do you believe that a new form of articles I Hope they don't I don't think there's a base for doing that right now I think we should wait until the report comes out\nThere talking about Utah's dire welcome to America on the line Jonathan thank you for having me by the way I knew that [laughter] and a reminder\nTo listeners we want to know how you feel about candidates who talked about impeaching the president either for or against call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five so yeah they're talking about you\nThey're saying that this is not a good idea we shouldn't be talking about this and yet there you are there you have been for more than a year now\nAnd what can we do to make serious issue\n[noise] it's just you and just last month the sponsor of what's going on trying to get you know ... years we want to bring them here legally\nAnd I'm a guy but what I don't know right I think we can do to make it gel people still want to come you don't want to work that's what I'm not saying model\nMy thank you very much for for calling into America on the line I mean the frustration that you hear in my voices frustration that I Am sure is shared by ... by millions of Americans who are frustrated\nBy the immigration system\nThat Congress in a bipartisan manner was working very hard to get a comprehensive immigration bill to the president's desk after he said in the Roosevelt Room that he wanted a quote bill of love\nAnd then turned around and kill kill kill the bill Doug how can Congress and how can an immigration reform bill ever come out of Congress and certainly with this president in the White House\nWon't insure Jonathan I don't think you can um I spent two and a half years working as you know I'm for house would you then house majority leader Eric Cantor where\nImmigration was a big part of them worked on and um he talked a lot about starting with the kids folks who were brought here young people were brought here through no fault of their own um and how do we make sure that they're taking care of and and treated with dignity and respect um\nHe lost his primary in part because of that more there's more to it than that but\nI remember being at the Republican a house conference meeting in January twenty fourteen where the house leadership with Tanner banner\nCadre Morse Rogers and Kevin McCarthy ... laid out what we wanted our immigration principles to be and as soon as that meeting was over\nThe conversation on immigration moving in the house was over so I I'm very much of a pass a pessimist almost unless Donald Trump waves and cuts the deal and I think on a lot of issues Donald Trump because of in fact\nUm some of the caustic rhetoric that he's made is it a unique position to cut the deal that uh maybe a President Bush for president Rubio meeting president Jeb Bush for president Rubio where Scott Walker wouldn't have been allowed to do by the Republican base I think that's wrong guns as well\nBecause I I think the fundamental differences Donald Trump and Stephen Miller and steep and and have a very specific white national vision for this country and\nSo when they think about immigration people from Trinidad are not welcome here under Donald Trump's America you know I think he's been very clear about the types of countries that he wants to see immigrants come from and they are not countries from the Caribbean or Africa or South America or Asia He wants to Europe and he wants his quote unquote good genes from Germany and so\nIf ... you know that's over the line I'm Sorry John or the light up your Avon lady's ... not to read the law and said that if it's going to hold on how was that over the line if I'm President Jonathan\nThis is what we have to deal with this conservative when we hear so much about civility who is your\n... from ... ... and just way find out participate in the living dead weight and think about what your party is going to families from Latin America every single day so you can sit here and talk about the valley but I'm quoting your president who talks about his good genes okay Chrissie\n... Cristina dug one of the things when we went through the whole as whole country's controversy was that part of the reporting that came out of a ... out of that meeting was that he said why aren't we getting people from\nSay Norway so it is it is part of the conversation Doug it's not it's not as Jonathan to\nHear how it is and I say this is somebody who's been pretty posed a lot of what Donald Trump ... come on to a program like this and I just have to hear the ... the United states would not disagree with a lot ... than a racist over and over and over again that's not going to progress any conversation in this country forward if that's if that's the rhetoric that is going to be and then again\nIt's my side that's not civil as my senators are being thrown out of restaurants and things like that how's the country are going to move forward it's not serious and I'm not going to participate in that\nOne of the country might move forward if we actually try and be a little more inclusive to everyone who isn't there are I wouldn't I Would have you on that I Would agree on that and then I Would say that starts with you as well yeah well you know we're all trying but I think the real problem is that this particular president has a very specific vision and what he won an Asian\nCasinos and Doug you guys are are done in the thirty seconds that we have left Maria do you have anything to add in what he was like\nYeah I think too many things you know what happened here I think just demonstrate how divisive or our country has become and you know I Do agree it's a scene that President Trump has been at the helm and he has actually been to one to really injected a lot of this divisiveness and has a weaponized and used it as our\nPolitical up fear mongering twelve and ... and with that for some\n... we're going to have to leave it there duck Hi thank you very much Christina Greer thank you very much rarer donor thank you and thanks to all of you for listening joined us again tomorrow night for America on the line\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support has provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White\nGood morning Houston Public media's the service of the University of Houston and support it with your gift to the Houston Public media foundation\nMore information at Houston Public media dot org slash donate and phone lines are open for your pledge of support during our fall sending fundraising campaign called eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or go to Houston Public media dot org\n[noise] healthcare is a problem that people in this district face every single day in New Jersey with fewer than three weeks until the midterms repealing Obamacare as a major issue in a hotly contested congressional race in the issue is leaving many voters on the fence and he\nI don't know I'm a I'm a little bit on the\nThat's on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR this morning beginning\nAt five and Houston Public media news eighty eight seven and I'm Stephen K and this is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven K.

this does it with this study does is to speak to the importance of the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... in a multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem\nAll over the world where there are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty eight thousand people with empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated so when we use this new drug ...\nAnd this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key to what it was a major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd we need new tools that when new tools like a new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis in the world\nAnd for that is and of course of availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess is extremely important in the fact that it was done in a country like Bill ... is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world the fact that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine\nOr so called program condition I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis and this way and this is this is ... ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough but remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistant and\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis is something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy\nSo what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis this empty Archie be this X. DR TB and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat until they came up with the the regiments containing ... for example ... treatment was\nUp to two we uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we called an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful inject shows\nUp for many many days of the treatment it means that we can cut the treatment down to a short in his nine months and we're working now and the TV community to get the regimen down to just six months\nFor hills so this new at suggest again for our listeners this new drug ... and it is kind of really cure um T. being all instances\n[noise] but ... is one of the as I say only the one of the two new drugs that we have\nWhenever we have a new drug or with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that is needed to develop new medications that we can give that we can give people\nAnd is it available now it is available the uh the company a Johnson and Johnson which has developed this medication\nHas a is currently where there are some trials going on around the world but they have made it available and they have reduced the price of the medication from a very very high price to or they just announced in that the AIDS meeting in July that they were going to reduce it to\nFour hundred dollars per regiment so for for each person has to take it\nThat's just too hot too high for many people around the world again I don't have the proper ... healthcare exactly so we need to get that price down even more dumped her up ... for ... thanks for joining us\nHe was introduced to James in China in a few minutes we'll meet the photographer documenting the African community of ... cut to let me give you a reminder of our main news stories on the BBC right now Saudi Arabia is going ahead with an investment conference despite a string of high profile withdrawals\nTurkey promises revealed the truth about the ... inside the Saudi conflict stumble up until much travel program including are going to Saudi Arabia a little bit later so President Trump has warned us intends to build up its nuclear arsenal to put pressure on Russia\nAnd the longest the British in the world has been a fishy open by the Chinese President Xi Jinping\nLet's get sports headlines now when you chat moaning China mess it ...

five kilometers long thinks the cities of Hong Kong in my power to the Chinese mainland\nHunch is not on the bridge but on a business to us here in London now I'm going to be honest I don't know when there's people get very excited by origin amazed me\nAh the bridge you wouldn't be surprised mood that it's been built to withstand earthquakes in Thai food ... quake prime region\nStrongest earthquake in the Hong Kong there was about seven on the magnitude scale ah was in Nineteen Eighteen however on his mother ... four hundred thousand tons of steel so no steals make sixty ...\nIt was built in the bridge about city kilometers of its total links crosses the see\nOver the poll river do to to allow ships to go through the good some put\nSix point seven kilometers with a bit actually goes on to the will to the need to also official islands so under the bridge and well the bridge was a joke then they go down into its own limit comeback I'm every bit more bridge again so just to keep it all going a nicely this is one of the most densely populated regions in the world would sixty eight billion people living in it\nIn the past traveling between two high in Hong Kong would take up to four hours and the new bridge cuts down to thirty minutes is my favorite part for you but for the moment is longer than ten kilometers longer than the channel tunnel\nUm so do you go to imagine instead of the journal from having a bridge would not be cool you could reach the ferries across you might be able to refer to fool perhaps between Hong Kong Macau drop\nYou can raise the ferries across [laughter] watch it on you know certainly America everybody who um is it needed\nTo fully needed and I'm very low he's the problem is the bridge was conceived in the Nineteen eighties to solve problems the region hub in the Nineteen eighties very much on it was just opening up at the time and so they were looking or tried to reach the Chinese economy or Hong Kong was in the\nIndustrialized doing but we're sort of outsourcing gets industrialization to elsewhere and so the choice of well this'll be a good infrastructure project mounting these two areas together parts of our trees will

to solve problems within the longer this professor me ... amazing ah from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and she was telling us why the opening of the bridge will not be judged by everyone\nThe idea of the project has been around for a long time\nWhen it was such a race a that was back in the Nineteen eighties when China just started opening her door\nAnd the whole idea you know uh and the

middle of the University of California is a co will so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks require\nBetween one to two billion dollars annually in order to adequately protect lands but they receive only me about three hundred and eighty million dollars annually so that's just about ten to twenty percent of what's needed\nSocial fool or just do not ... the most protected areas what over a billion dollars across the country that's correct I'm not going to change anytime soon as it\nNo in fact it may get to be a higher number as lions continue to decline in the pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively\nYou twice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S the ball team like the Detroit Lions so\nRelatively small cost we really can't save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parts\nIn the report you make the link 'em but if there isn't a major increase in funding there will be a decline in the population of ... that were you for your social norms why what's the link\nOh because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all the truth of levels below them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly through ecosystem benefits like clean water\nHealthy soils and so saving protected areas saving wildlife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut more ... repeated this on the funding for parks is long term problem and yet the lines were still look\nYes that's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally about where now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now there are species will continue to decline\nAnd so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the

town to buy a mega millions lottery ticket to be in with a chance of winning a record breaking one point six billion dollar checkpoint\nJackpot but what are your odds of winning and it led you know I spoke to dilute left in a statistician with Georgia Tech school of mathematics to find out why you would have to be very very lucky\nThe mega millions as a ... a lottery that crosses most of the United states there's about\nI think maybe four states that are not included so it's really almost like a a national lottery in the U.S where people buy a ticket or two dollars and they choose one special number out of twenty five and then five other numbers out of Seventy\nAnd if they match all six numbers they'll win the jackpot is one point six billion assuming no one else chooses the same number and the winters will get their share after taxes or\nSo I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that if I buy one ticket mild on winning up ...\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one and three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes\nBut win the jackpot ... gets large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves those billionaire\nSo even if my one in three hundred million show comes off that possibly others who will be sharing it with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nThat's correct I Believe the the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there is a pretty good chance that someone's going to win\nSo deals on me winning a pretty ... 'cause I'm not in the U.S but the old some someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the how the numbers fall\n... would it technically be possible\nTo by so many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you could buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are\nThree hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then uh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of courses you're not guaranteed that you'll be the only winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winter\nAnd I spent on top of that to share logistics of buying that many tickets I'm going to be easy\nTo absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that even if you have somebody going out of all possible numbers in a certain range about one ticket every ten seconds you\nMight be one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the lottery is wrong but you need to fill up three hundred million so you're going to need to hire a thirty thousand people and I take that old gonna want to share with my ... tonight greedy I Would imagine that they're all going to expect a share maybe they could do a little uh\nYou know if you get the the winning tickets like a heartland the chocolate factory you might be the one who gets it\nIn ... I'm probably not going to win this last round my\nI I Would say that's the safest bet I know and in fact I Would say that no one listening to this program is likely to win the lottery I Know the BBC has lots of listeners but I'm going to go out on a limb if you are listening to this program and you win the lottery called me up and proving I'm wrong\n[laughter] come on [laughter] on the thought of him wrong theloop left to enroll him\nYet [laughter] interesting lady said he's by get tickets so he's not even quite techies divide up here we are attacked stayed on this one at the BBC since you announced at one point six billion US dollars ... ... you know jumping thinking may thoughts it's amazing what the mine does but one ... the above and wait for this I even have no access to\nBottle free tickets have a good day or is it every she says she ever get to Mars the setting that somebody's tax cuts for the full\nTime seven eighty six twenty fifty eighty five new cyber James and trying to think about getting rich from\nHouston Public media's a service of the University of Houston and support it with your gifts to the Houston Public media foundation more information that Houston Public media dot org slash donate\nAnd phone lines are open for your pledge of support during our fault fundraising campaign called eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or go to Houston Public media dot org\nPublic media members I invited to a behind the scenes look at public broadcasting with an exclusive free station too\nSchedule your tour and Houston Public media Houston Public media dot org slash contact\nGood morning to you on Stephen K and this is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven K.

films about and let's begin with one of them is pervasive ideas about Cleopatra that have had a legendary beauty\nShe was a woman of supposing beauty\nAnd at that time when she was in the prime of you know she was most striking\nShe also possess the most charming voice knowledge of how to make a self agreeable to everyone\nBeing brilliant to look up on and to listen to with the power to subjugate everyone even a lump cited man already passed his prime\nShe thought that would be in keeping with a road to me Caesar and she wrote posed in her beauty old her claims to the from\n[noise]\nThe woods the Rehman historian Cassius here was rushing around two hundred years after care Potter lived yet translated by on his carry Joyce when do we start to seek ... beauty mentioned in the historical sources and and how was she described\nWell the ... summit them anyway let's see if all\nI think what they trying to do is to explain why two rounds great just men could have fallen for this woman\nBecause actually there's no eye witness account of what she looks like what we have these very few images of a including school ... and if we look at those it would appear that she wasn't beautiful certainly as we would classify beauty today so it seems almost at the beauty that people talk about with an explanation\nAs to what happened but not necessarily based in find\n... if you'd like it's a it's a way to excuse the the week ... behavior of to these needing more is that she was physically it resists doubles\nYeah ... is an enemy of room but she's hard to great Romans on has signed and they have to explain to the room and people because I'm saving obviously want to explain how he defeated this woman but she doesn't necessarily want to\nRuin their reputations are Julius

initially you you have some relevant objects because they're all very few physical objects that survived that relate to care ... on the well\nCruz do we have from them before she might have looked like\nWe have in the most ... in in Italy probably a bust representing your ...\nAlso another representation on a slab bonus owns lab where she's represented to get a reverse song says Ari and even here though we cannot really talk about portrait so her choice just mentioned it remains\nVery difficult to explain how she actually looked like we don't even know what's it called over hair over ... might have been we don't even know if you looked more European like being from a ... of ... off\nIssue was more like Mediterranean were very dark hair and our cars\nMaria despite its lack of solid evidence this Raymond idea of care ... has a great Ricci keeps cropping up again and again doesn't it across the centuries I wondered if you could give us a few examples\n[noise] yes well just to go back slightly it it is the case it quite a few of the ancient sources say she wasn't beautiful to tool will she was was hugely charismatic and intelligent and in some ways it's that aspect to her in that capacity to cities that has been\nWritten by this focus on her ... and her beauty and it's a foot because very much that belongs to the western world in large part in paintings and the Knicks richer\nAnd we find that there's a circus on her ... she because it's not perceived to be a beauty the effectively changed the world\nWithout the beauty the west and the east of the Mediterranean might have looked very different Egypt might not have been made subordinate to ... to things could have happened bumped for Cleopatra speech he said as an intensity to the desire to explore her appearance\nAnd by the time we get to the twentieth century with the development of the retail industry we find that it's a whole production of products that are related to Cleopatra\nUm here we find that she's made both extraordinarily glamorous but also in a sense everyday accessible you two could have Cleopatra's power\nExcept now it's only sexual power you two could have a passion for the price of a sham poo or soap pa motive was particularly good at this in the beginning of the century by the time we get to the Nineteen sixties it's coal ... associated with the stock you pay to\nIn the sixty three films Elizabeth Taylor\nJewish thoroughfare many stories about the ... she went to to maintain the supposed beauty aren't the most famous being our space that she faced daily and asked his milk is that any treat them is\nKnown known that we know of um we we don't know that she was in any way can send a bunch that looks\nBut again because we believe she's a beautiful woman we also like to believe that she had all these beauty profit from this will she occupy time with ... ruling a country and helping many children you know she was ... busy enough without having to do that as well\nA memory of the major ever have physical appearance has also extend it as far as her race when did this become an issue and why was the scene is important\nI think the importance about this is in the struggle to reclaim Cleopatra for Egypt\nSo debate started decades ago I mean even in the nineteenth century a debate about whether she had an Egyptian blunt uh partly because they seem to be so little information if any tool about her mother or grandmother\nBut more recently in the late twentieth century the question is not being\nWas Cleopatra Egyptian the genetic sense but will she black\nThis much is particularly in the Nineteen nineties when woods with the rise of afro centrist them and for centuries some positions Egypt is the point of origin uncertain Cleopatra them becomes in ... of a powerful woman at the starting point of African history\nShould claiming the ... as black whether that has any basis in history or not is it relevant claiming her as black becomes important counter to the prejudices of gender and race and the possession of Cleopatra by the white male western wild [noise]\nWhich seems to originate in the ancient sources around about the fourth century a historian tells us that Cleopatra was so beautiful that men paid for a night with her with their lives\nAnd that's very interesting because again it's transformation of the political Cleopatra who might've been involved in motives for political purposes interrupted the Petra\n...

D Archie being which is even worse\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatments success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any any comparison to even usual tuberculosis\nAnd even though there were at will be called adverse events there were some lab abnormalities almost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped\nWhat this study does is to speak to the importance\nOf the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... in a multi drug resistant\nAnd extensively drug resistant tuberculosis\nAnd this is a problem all over the world where there are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty eight thousand people with empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated so when they use this new drug ... and this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis\nAnd that seems to have been the key\nSo what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd we need new tools new tools like a new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately ever going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis in the world\nAnd for this and then of course the availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess is extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the ... is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine\nOr so called program conditions I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis and this way and this is this is ... ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big break through a bit remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistant\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis is something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy\nSo what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis this empty arch Eby it's ... and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat\nUntil they came up with uh the regiments containing ... for example the deck on treatment was up to ... uh two years and now when we had the short

had enough time to prove myself so people interact with me are juggling based on the one that I'm actually put it\nCan get you have a similar body of work and impressive body of work when you were then directing a music video you allow to cool to show the adults do you think undisturbed\n... I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with and how collaborative the oddest wants to date I always approach every project openly and seeing that each time it said hold different experience because I'm always I kind of different people\nKick the can get very some autistic on his but you've worked with a lost his email on this it's not my choice will by chance yes\nIn some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but the results or the fact that you can often be patched late I Would say ... cost or pigeonholed based on your previous work so I say if you had a lot of success with women felt an artist it's very likely you'll get a lot of the sharks which has been in my experience to have you\nTend to work with them at the beginning of their careers when they still trying to establish who they are going to be in some ways yeah yeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent me a lot can be when I look at the spread of artist you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and ...\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for me people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to fuse women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr a public place so strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that it'll move because one of the most effective ways of promoting music is it via sex\nYou know who won the video naked album cover some ways to sending product but any way to you personally drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an artist and you know the exploitation\nLook it depends on what I'm inspired by\nHighlight flooded with the idea of the body\nAnd sects of course but it's from a different places from a typical plate is from a place of sensuality there's a subtle sexiness a woman holds weight and she is powerful in her own sensuality I Do exploit but is it tasteful yes I think a lot of the\nQuote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that's what inspired by that one if I had my\nUm it might be gratuitous to some places I've never gratuitous when I Am\nPutting a concept together there are few things I'm looking at does this promote the art is what are you trying to say I never think in a way way I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd just has someone throwing dollars that are all if I'm going to do that you have to me for a pay off at the end that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nYeah because I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician was kid on the phone is cool cheese me and said to the gentleman's club you went to a gentleman\nAnd the women dancing but I think in the hands of a different directed at that video because I didn't really standing absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nThat is actually the most raunchy videos ever done when it gets\nIt was a it was a big deal because prior to that was it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but just to be clean cut and that video was one of the things that broken into that sex symbol kind of thinking\nAnd I knew he had a little bit nervous about it including Twenty one I mean at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women and Dunn says but it it's not like you said it every once in the hands of maybe somebody else\nWill not have been tastefully done from the costumes that they were wearing they had the ... and there was something very central about the Don says they have the power and he was the one he's always overwhelm\nThe wasn't anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is as you probably wants to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know\nIf there was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of\nThose famous videos is out of the American sing a Katy Perry song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking at a movie production views on the video for cleaned and by then we can sing with Laura how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is all through two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with an artist no doubt you're putting your own personal standpoint that project is no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with what he meant intuition and you'll making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of king about his flavor to project however I always really tried to not let that pass them stop or to take\nAn artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more\nHonest thing that you\nDidn't want to put your personal ... that's what a notice that it's just wanted to do see can recognize easy that is the\nKing of the product you know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashioned about five years ago where all these ... to start putting names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about is not this is a ... but it's meant for the artist if anything suit\nCan get what you say that the common theme is about how women want to come across these videos about and you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the ... see how you in ... because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have the\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay and they can eat as much to me through how you go from page to find them put up take what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me the fall I go back I could listen to a song and meeting yes he's snatching bits of pictures in my head like I just see like still frames and then I just have to read those things together and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to\nYou know please don't when I'm washing my team I got a point when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to stay away from is\nThinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't\nThink about the idea and then she would come to me in ways and eat at home when I'm sleeping and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down because I Know I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and hundreds of another hundred\nThe article I Love that idea\nA hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I shouldn't have about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point is a level of trust that has come in in in my career based off precedence of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do and I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'll be quick deposit I'm the business person\nSecond to last ... plus one plus one I'm pitching while cutting an idea very passionate about it I can see I can change that I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look to just you're going to win the ...\nThe entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know let me let me I can get 'em\nGimme talks about repeated ... of the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore I'm\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you always supplemental you know I almost I guess yeah if you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just\nA lot in the Niger in society and you can do is I've never been put in that situation ever\nAnd if somebody did said if somebody did request [laughter] I'd like to skin female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that\nOh I definitely have to say on that because\nIf what you're trying to portray or\nWhat you're trying to tell me that life is in ... which is more beautiful than adults and just because of the cause is getting it I'm going to have a problem with that I'd never been put in that position thank goodness thank God so it's very easy for me to sit here and be on them I can go this is what I Would do\nBut then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably know from other conversation I had with that person I knew that if not the kind of person I Want to work with but I never ever been put in that physicians\nCan get you see more women come into the four\nAbsolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the only ... director\nWhich is a very big global company I was definitely the only one in your ... maybe that was like one other one in the U.S but there was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty years you know he's in Paris\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London so yeah like I said I was one fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women are now realizing there's every reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls popping up\nWhat do you think it's changed can get what is it allows for them to come out now\nIt's hard to be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to\nAccess editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing eyes of the last two years it's been a initiative started by a female pressure put on her I'll quote free to bed which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line basically just needs to be female to be a part of it so in case somebody looking for a female director that can just sort of go on the website and have a look and say he's out there\nThat basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually pledge to have females in every single pitching process of a commercial this health again doing\nBusiness know Kenny how who feel oh you that soon you won't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director\nIt's already happening when I first came into the industry I mean you had fuel directly with the wind you needed to do if you think it's a problem globally did when I was in Africa\nAnd especially in Nigeria picking up or something can with an earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that and one of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little girl watching the TV can see that in the U.S looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls who people like king of seeing people like me but I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry not just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men\nWhen I have interviews I very very conscious of the words that I use a lot of times when you when when you have interviews and ... what they tend to say is oh so what does it feel like being in in ... industry plus correction is it's not a real industries a male dominated industry they're trying to change that I wrote that tell you\nHow I had been able to come into the industry think about how to drugs remain\nI Need to use positive would if I go oh well it's me it's so hot and da da da da da\nThen you might get into the house all the little girl watches she's going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep back and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to see me um see that I Am actually competing in this industry that's number one number two men to ship something that did\nFor me is every once in awhile I'll let you go on Instagram go anyway just pull out women uncle come over here and you can be on this project and then I'm just being around understanding that it can be drawn senior woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on\nTo be their own directed\nDoing their own little project I\nSaid last question is your dream artists which is what you'd like to work with Kenny\nI Would say be unfair because she will challenge\n\nAgainst each other for that one

Day at Stoneman Douglas High school in Florida what you're about to hear some of the distressing audio recorded by panicking students a lone gunman is making his way through costumes\nAttack in Parkland led to the deaths of Seventeen school children and stuff\nIt was the most high profile multiple shooting in twenty eight team but in fact less deadly than to others last year in Texas and Nevada the rate of these horrifying killings breeze by loan shooters has seemed to accelerate over recent years is also intensified the political argument in the U.S when and by how much\nShould America tightened its gun laws\n... is a reporter with the progress of gun control lobby group based in Washington DC gun control is very much\nThat is a lax and I think we've seen a number of mass shootings in the United states in the past few years that have made gun control a political issue and I think the timing of the Parkland shooting\nIn Florida this February just before the midterms really made it so that candidates across the country have to respond to this issue of gun legislation and what they would do if they were elected\nHow is it coming across a congressman themselves being direct he lobbied\nThere are more interest groups coming in supporting candidate from the left from the gun safety lobby then there have been in past elections\nI think it's interesting that the national Rifle Association has a decreased presence in these midterm elections either because of their financial woes this year or because they just understands that the money is really coming in from the other side\nThe national Rifle Association or NRA is as a player in this debate America's oldest civil rights organization at low base for the rights of us citizens to bear arms to keep\nAs it says with the second amendment to the U.S constitution Bob Spitzer is a professor of political science at the state University of New York and he studied extensively the roots of the organization\nThe n._r._a. was formed way back in Eighteen Seventy one by to civil war veterans who during the civil war saw first hand that the typical American young adult male didn't no one end of a gun from the other\nAnd so they formed the n._r._a. to improve the shooting a marksman chip skills of\nMilitia eligible men and they did shooting tournaments sporting competition and things like that and it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties that it began to turn ... attention more to politics Congress passed the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd in the Nineteen seventies there was a measure in Congress to severely restrict access to hand guns\nGun rights people within the n._r._a. felt that they were being attacked in besieged by the rest of the country so that group took control than ever since then they become much more political much more focused even obsessed with what they call gun rights and it's produced the organization that we know today\nSo the n._r._a. is kind of rabble rousing group that ... the rights of Americans to bear arms is not a gun lobby group and yet it does have a presumably an intimate relationship with the gun making industry\nWell the ... does have a long connection to the gun industry and had behaved as the sort of political mouthpiece because they have one overriding common interest to press as many guns into his many hands as possible\nThat have been a number of school shootings of course in the United states we think of Columbine Sandy Hook and others most recently has been the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Florida which\nDoes seem more than other events to of galvanized a movement against the gun lobby how much of a threat has that been to the the ...\nThe high school students who turned to the Parkland high school in Florida\nThey did something that victims have never done before instead of seeking privacy and avoiding the media they went in front of national cameras\nAnd said look we're sick of this our leaders have failed us we're tired of them being afraid of the gun lobby and they have aggressively push this issue throughout the spring summer and now into the fall of this election year and\nBy doing that they're trying to keep the issue as a top tier concern so that after the elections there may be greater momentum to perhaps in ... stronger gun laws\nThat it was a terrible tragedy and\n\nThe money he received from the [noise]\nThe lord of the shooting them and Douglas students like ... here have\nDirected that political file on the end alright federal advocate ... describes as surprisingly affected the students efforts to galvanize political opinion and an emerging ... campaign around the n._r._a. have been\nThe victims and survivors of these of this shooting were high school students who knew very smartly how to use social media and how to kind of\nLeverage their pain and their fear into politics very quickly and there were a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to NRA members and a lot of them are household names you had a rental car companies that I'm sure people\nUse all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all those companies for trans parents say the public deserves to now which companies are\nSupporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting very quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly\nPulled their relationships with the n._r._a. which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of forums for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nHard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the n._r._a. finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty eight ten ...\nElections they're spending far less candidates that we would\nHave expected them to go all and far\nNot much does appear to be true recent findings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nWe didn't try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for this ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we'll say failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies have withdrawn from that support for the n._r._a. but we did reach one kind of debates ... that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment ...\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nAnd there was a petition and to us than ... some of the thousand signatures on it and what we've already watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what the machine and went from in front of primary and our social media channels [noise]\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and rainy trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long canyon vendors ... whose ethics were posted two hours and then ... them holding company [noise]\nSo they were very round people um that I was in line to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so it would mean a centrally uh with the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your shelves products made by this phone vista outdoor ... which\nWas you would not setting firearms or I mean they shouldn't yourself this drought during does manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then visceral outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey've got it up for sale I don't think it's been sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up and this and boycotts of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nI'm here to tell you [noise] you've gotta walk past reason [noise]\nYou had the reason standing there in the corner you know smoking a cigarette and looking all smog and you're going to
