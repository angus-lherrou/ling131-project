bring you the latest political news analysis and your calls\nSo we can get a sense of how we're all doing as we approach November sixth election day we've got a lot to talk about tonight and health care is topic hey thanks to the op ed in USA Today written by President Trump\nThe peace painted a dire picture of what will become of America if the government of dumped say Medicare for all health insurance system\nWhich is a number of ... which is a number of Democrats support and a lot of voters do too but here's the thing trumped up that is full of wet politifact and the Washington Post fact checkers Glenn Kessler say our misstatements in fact ... wrote almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a false could\nSo before we get into the nitty gritty of all this here's a question for you does Medicare for all seemed like a good idea or one of those too good to be true promises that politicians can't really deliver on\nCall us with your thoughts that eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five eight to five five you can also send us as always a tweet using the hash\nTag a T L K joining me to explain what Medicare for all really is and what it isn't is Jonathan Cohn senior correspondent for half post\nJonathan Cohn thank you for being on America on the line thank you for having me on the show so Johnson the Democrats failed today to pass a bill that would have eliminated what's being called short term health care plans but don't cover pre existing conditions what are the short term plans and why did Democrats wants to eliminate them\nShow short term plans have been around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act um and they were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you you you're going to be a couple of months you know between this\nDish employer an employee or your insurance is gonna lap and you could pay out of pocket for these policies and they weren't very good right I mean they cover some things you know maybe it's some doctor visits or maybe they didn't didn't some hospitalization up to a point on and they wouldn't and it and they were all like the old policies were right you couldn't get them if you had preexisting conditions and ah if you\nGot one of these policies and they discovered\nThat you've got sick but you'd actually had it before you bought the policy they wouldn't pay for that either are they charging more for your pre existing condition um you know a four to ... comes along Obamacare comes along now everybody can get a you know it's supposed to be able to get comprehensive real insurance right you know the kind that you know would cover any medical service you might need and\nYou know as a limit on you're out of pocket costs and\nUh the Obama administration said okay well you know now that we have this we don't need these short term policies anymore you know and they kind of let them linger but they were really careful to say look they only last for three months and maybe it was basically they didn't want people buying these policies in part because a lot of people would buy them\nAnd not realize they were basically buying like a piece of junk coverage or something close to it [noise]\nWell you know the Trump Administration came in and they want it to repeal the Affordable CARE Act I wanted to get rid of all these regulations that made you know comprehensive insurance\nThey're guilty as charged this is what they're they've done and so they're only recourse is to run these ads which like Trump's op ed lie about what they've done and you know they're just they're hoping I think basically the voters don't wind up\nJonathan Cohn senior national correspondent for post thank you very much for being on America on the line thank you for having me\nAnd joining me now in the studio or Catherine Rampell Washington Post columnist on politics and economics and also with us Brian Lehrer host of WNYC use the Brian Lehrer show and remember we're taking your calls and your thoughts about Medicare for all at eight four four\nSeven four or five eight to five five welcome Catherine that to be here Brian as always thank you for being here identifying\nSo I Want to pick up on the last question I asked Jonathan and throw it out to the the two of you and I'll start with cancer and why aren't the Republicans talking about the economy and about their tax cuts and instead focusing on health care where they are an squishy ground aren't they\nAre yes they are on the ground but they are on much squishy or ground on tax cuts arguably the tax cuts are phenomenally unpopular\nAnd they have then basically since they were introduced last year this is something that the donors wanted and maybe some of their base but amongst the general population they are not popular this is a getaway to\nThe very wealthy to corporations or there's some tax cuts that went to middle income people lower income people but they're so Mott is that people haven't really noticed that you know lots of things affect your paycheck from week to week for a month to month\nAnd so the fact that you get to keep a little bit more of your money\nOr because you're a tax rate went down you may not even notice\nSo the tax cuts themselves are not a winning political issue\nA repealing Obamacare also they learned not winning political issue precisely because people finally learned what that meant right they were all on board with repealing Obamacare when they didn't when when the public did not know what was in it and now that they know what's in it including these protections for people with preexisting conditions they want it to stick around\nSo Brian is what what the Republicans are doing is this sort of like a latter day three card Monte like they're trying to do the right squishy ground on the tax cuts there and squishy ... really squishy ground on health care and yet\nI'm as Jonathan Cohn was just saying I'm In Missouri the Republican Josh Hawley he's running ads touting healthcare\nYeah I mean here's my whopper of choice from the president's USA Today a bed and Jonathan Cohn referred to this to Trump says he kept his promise to keep pre existing coverage even well dismantling Obamacare will today\nThe very same day as the op ed Senate Republicans voted with Trump's support to allow low cost health insurance plans and guess what insurance companies may make them lower cost\nBy not covering preexisting conditions so on protecting preexisting conditions what are you going to believe Trump or your lying eyes\nYou know what I mean that seems to be a sort of the the the ... of of the Trump Administration but when you are I mean that's the president's saying if you've got a again I keep bringing up Josh Hawley Missouri because really playing his ad in in the next segment but it's\nI Katherine helped me here because I don't understand how Republicans are able with a straight face run ads touting their support for health care when there is demonstrable prove that they are trying to take people's health care away\nBecause they know that this is an issue that Americans care about ... again I I keep coming back to what was\nAnd learning grow if I were to put a price tag on public media it would be a number that no American number I'm parents both in and I support the public needs new make it possible with your financial support\nThank you focus on Facebook at Houston Public\nMedia and tweet us at Houston Public media and trying to think Kmart and you're listening to America on the line from WNYC radio\nAnd public radio stations across the country this is a show about politics in the mid term elections and\nNow the election day is twenty seven days away we want to check in on key races here what the candidates are talking about and share some of their notable commercials still with me in Studio to do that or Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show and WNYC and Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell before we jump into calls and commercial\nBrian you want it in on what we're talking about in the very end of the last\nSegment about the fed yeah and the president attacking the\nTwo things I think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers in the interests of owners are sometimes at odds\nAnd raises the question which one is the government including said I'm going to favor this happened back in the nineties as well unemployment would go down\nThe fed would raise interest rates so that unemployment didn't go down\nTo quickly uh and spark inflation and progressive set that time would howl at the fed for raising rates because it was like the fed Alan Greenspan in those days wanted enough unemployment why does he want workers to be out of jobs that's not progressive\nAnd if we're looking at Trump now putting pressure politically on the fed is hardly unique I pulled out this article from Nineteen Ninety three justice Bill Clinton was taking office\nFor the New York times and it says Mr Clinton and the governors of the fed or on a collision course because of the central bank wants economic growth to continue its slow takeoff hoping to keep inflation heading down or the Mr Clinton's advisors have a quite different goal for faster economic growth to fulfill his campaign pledge sound familiar\nI don't know who that was at the end maybe it was a uh granted but another excerpt from um congressman Rob occurs at if he really taking on both parties parmesan rubber do it [laughter] no no\nThat's not that I'm aware of I mean I think the Republican pet plant as far as I can tell it\nFor performing healthcare it's just don't ever get sick you know it's like the richer don't get sick um it's not protections for people with preexisting conditions\nI don't know those particular races to be honest but the whole yeah it sounded like he was on the defensive like Claire McCaskill the Democrat was saying\nHoly would take away your coverage for preexisting conditions and he had to put up an ad that said no I Would well somebody in the Missouri press corps I presume is asking holy would you vote if you were less\nTo the Senate for the bill that all the Republican senators except Susan Collins did vote for today that would end the guarantee for preexisting conditions in insurance policies and so you could hear at least how he was on the defensive there I'm I'm not sure within Rebecca had in mind\nUm he uh he wrote Barker is a part of I'm Sorry hall Holly my apologies Holly is a part of that lawsuit in Texas are trying to to kill the a four to ... want to go to this ad from a leaf Slotkin who's running for Congress in Michigan\nCongressman bishop smiling at the White House after voting got protections for pre existing condition something inside me ... I'm running for Congress and I approve this message because Mr bishop that's dereliction of duty and it's a fireball events\nNow the tone of the tone in her ad is one of ... I mean it's defiance is anger ... of the three that we've heard that one to me anyway it sounds like it has she has her finger on the poles maybe not just of her her congressional district but of the country when it comes to health care no\nYeah again um these are very popular protections amongst both Democrats and Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation has pulled on this multiple times\nAnd to my knowledge every time they have found that a large majority of Republicans believe that these protections for people with preexisting conditions should stay on the books and I think not only because of a sense of fairness but also because\nI'm most people are either themselves have some sort of condition that could on ... in the immediate term or longer term uh affect the cost of their carrots some day people are going to get old\nAnd and going to have health problems even if they are young and healthy and uh you know seemingly invincible today and or they have family members who do so this is a very personal issue for a lot of people\nI think it's excessive faith in the marketplace\nThe libertarian philosophy that the market is going to take care of all the country's problems I don't think there's a country in the world where the market really takes place of health care\nBecause health care economics or such that if you really need serious health care it's unbelievably expensive and it's going to bankrupt individuals\nUh but you know if all of us are only temporarily able bodied and stuff's going to happen to all of us if the Republicans believe in savings up front than they believe in more devastation when you're sick\nI Want to go to that paradise in the Pacific Hawaii and and calling in from Honolulu thank you for calling into America on the line\nI think you I'm Glad to be here\nIn Nineteen Seventy four the state of Hawaii he says the law that made it mandatory that no insurance companies could\nCharge anyone more if they had a pre existing conditions they also made it so any person who were work twenty hours a week or more\nWas covered by their employer with health insurance the amount of money that was allowed to be deducted from their paycheck for no more than ten percent of their ...\n... people in Hawaii you have to work two jobs so that meant you had the opportunity to have doubled coverage what that all men was there was an incredible pool of people\nIn the insurance we had a number of different choices you could have a PPO you could have an HMO\nSailor usually two or three in your own says you can choose from with your company based on the size of your company sent meant you had really low health insurance costs everybody was covered\nAnd we have one of the healthiest states in the nation Obamacare change some of that not necessarily for the better but I Would like everybody to be able to have with the state of Hawaii made real in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd I want to thank you very much for for calling in from from Honolulu calling into America on the line I mean is that is that the solution just the Hawaii model\nYou know to be honest I I don't know much about the Hawaii not all but one um [noise] point that I Would just make is that\nIf you require insurance companies to charge everybody the same price at for insurance and cheaper to cover all sorts of conditions as Obamacare did at the very least you know he said essential health benefits\nUm and not turn people away\nFor having a healthcare problems that that can end up itself not necessarily solve the problem because if you don't require people to buy insurance only the people who need insurance by it to help the people don't buy it and then the prices just spiral out of control so I I think you need those protections for people but you also need requirements that people buying insurance\nIs Catherine Rampell Brian Lehrer thanks so much for being here tonight I'm we're gonna play that Ted Cruz at one of these days the really funny ones

like the administration's stated\nPolicy of America First call us at eight four four seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five our next guest has a great deal to say about America's leadership role in the world Robert Kagan is a columnist for the Washington Post\nA senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of the jungle grows back America and our imperiled world\nBob welcome to America on the line thanks for having me well I'm I Am thrilled to have you on a and especially to talk about your book because one it's terrific and it is a great history lesson\nTo sort of remind people of uh we're how the United states became the so called leader of the free world and I want to um [noise] I Want you to explain what you mean by the jungle grows back and I want you to expand\nOn on this one line that's on page nine of your of your book you say that the creation of the liberal order has been an act of defiance against both history and human nature\nTalk more about that\nWell sure I mean you know if you think about the great a sweep of human history uh most people have lived under tyranny in poverty and in the state of constant warfare that's pretty much the story of humankind going back as far as recorded history and I'm sure back before that as well\nUm and the period that we've been living in since the end of World War two a has been entirely different it's been a time of incredible prosperity we've seen four billion people\nYou know there were the most generous people in the world where we're not where people were selfish like everybody else but the United states occupies a unique position geographically a we happened to be an enormously powerful wealthy country\nThat has not surrounded by other dangerous power it's like every other power in the world isn't a very dangerous neighborhood that allows us to deploy our horses and keep peace\nThousands of miles from home without risking our own security that's a unique position no one else could take the United states plays even if they were of a mind to do so um I think what we're more likely to see in the absence\nThere is a complete breakdown order of the kind that we saw in the Nineteen thirties\nSo can you talk more about just sort of ... D stabilizing\nUm nature of President Trump's field tea um or seeming affinity to ... strong men or two Russian President Vladimir Putin or to a Kim Jong un of North Korea\n[noise] well I think in that case um\nFor one thing in a system built around alliances of the way the American system is it actually is a lot easier to push around your allies than your adversaries because your allies are dependent on you the facts of the United states and Trump have been able to squeeze\nMarginally better deals out of Canada and Mexico and could probably\nSqueeze a bed marginally better deals out of Europe too is partly because those countries are entirely dependent on the United states and so we can use that leverage against them\nIn the case of adversaries they're not dependent on the United states and they actually can do was damaged and I think that\nTrump in a way a is a classic kind of you know the phrase I Would use as a kind of bully tower he's talked with the people you can push around with and he's very deferential to the people who can hurt him and so he looks at a guy like who well setting aside whatever\nComplicated relationship ... may have with Russia in a general sense but who was a strong guy who can do\nDamage to us a Kim Jong alone is a strong guy who can fire missiles at us and so those people\nHe's rather a sequel is up to our allies use the bully and so you know I think at a certain sense there's there's a logic to it but it's it's not a very sort of a I think a very attractive logic\nMhm you know the the um I\nI'm I'm thinking of uh of three things here I'm under normal circumstances or the president of the United states um the United states would be forcefully out there on this um the stories about the um um the head of Interpol um and what the Chinese have done um\nOur colleague a Washington Post a global an opinion columnist your mouth ...\nAnd his disappearance or Russia poisoning um people in Great Britain with these things be happening if there was a forceful voice coming out of the White House\nNot only that only expressing condemnation from the United states but also standing on those principles that made the United states a shining example to other nations\nBut I mean I don't want to pretend that nothing bad ever happened when the United states was playing its role in the world obviously bad things always happen but I think that you are identifying saw a a real trend here\nAnd the trend is that all kinds of bugs around the world are increasingly believing that they can get away with doing things like this I think in the case of the\nThe the Saudis I'm as it appears assassinating\nOf orange or a Saudi journalist in a foreign\nCountry and sending out a hit team to get him that would not happen unless they were pretty sure\nThat the United states wasn't going to do anything about it after all Saudi Arabia is entirely dependent on the United states for its defense and survival so they had to believe that they should that the Americans would do nothing a similarly for the things that we see Russia doing\nIn terms of poisoning spot so there's this general sense a that it that everybody is sort of free to do what they want and there is no there's no one in four seeing any kind of a fundamental decency in the international system I think there's no question that the increasing absence of the United states in that role\nIs not only encouraging these actions but as one courage more and more and in fact more serious kinds of actions in the in the years to come\nBy boat one were to answer your the name of your book is the jungle grows back if the United states um gets in a new president Democrat or Republican who um decides to stand up for the liberal um the liberal world order will it be too late to beat back the jungle\nI think it depends when it happens that can have a point where it's too late I Want a state of the first point is you've got to re educate the American people why it matters\nAll

days ago the ... office for national statistics published it summary of the day to the old ... in England and Wales into thousands in Seventeen and one section caught our attention divorces all same sex couples so here's a question\nWhich same sex marriages are more likely to end in divorce those between men all those between women\nAnd the dates were clear about Seventy five percent of same sex divorces have been between women\nThere have been slightly more marriages between women but not nearly enough to account for the difference so women are getting divorced from women a lot more than men are getting divorced for men\nAnd this isn't just the u._k. the same pattern shown in Belgium the Netherlands Norway Sweden everywhere whether a statistics on same sex divorce it's the same sex during the ... the divorcing\nThis latest one but what was going on but who could help us with such a question the onset of course is I was always an economist\nWe spoke to do to marina out shade the Vancouver School of economics in Canada\nShe's the author of dirty money a book which applied economic counties to the study of sex and love and she's been digging into the data for us to try to find a few reasons why it's more likely that women will divorced women and men will divorced men\nOne of the things that we do know about opposite sex relationships is that women are significantly more likely to be the ones who initiated the divorce so that you might think well if there's two women in their relationship thing you're twice as likely to get somebody who wants out of the relationship is that sure that's one possible explanation for this story\nOkay so what other explanations if you have\nThe second thing that you think about is is how long people have been in a relationship so there's a joke that you might have heard about which is what does a lesbian and bring to a second date and the answer is and you're moving van with all of her possessions\nThis is a stereotype the evidence is anecdotal but we can't say one way or another if this is the case just because the data doesn't exist\nThere's always ... type is true if we don't have the evidence than the idea would be lesbian relationships move more quickly and then they get married earlier and then maybe didn't realize they made a mistake\nThey are absolutely so they're they're not spending as much time getting to know each other before they get married there or not ... for several years for example before they get married\nMaybe that would be reflected they when they ... we might have for example about the age of the people going into the relationship\nYou know this is actually something that's really interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually been able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorced is a predictor of divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down in in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent or over the age of thirty five compared to fifty two percent of men\nTo women are marrying much younger than the men and so that could be one of the reasons why we see female same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships\nAnd that makes sense I suppose it then poses the following question as to why there is an age difference but we're probably going to be speculation about anything else\nWell this is not a thing is that we know that people who may or may first second third maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time\nAnd that's another thing that we can actually see in the in the data that we've been provided so among the women who are in same sex relationships thirty seven percent of them have already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know again that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nAs a researcher looked into this and related questions was do you need now to go deep or is it more detail in the day to the office rational statistics already have or is it different kinds of questions I was just that you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these devices wanted to be happening across three\nTime will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example one of the possibilities as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup\nThan men do and this is actually in that data so among people who've been separated for two years before divorcing there's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the matter waiting a little bit longer they separated we don't know if they separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relationship breakup but she will notice every relationship very aware of serving the finding of paperwork and maybe men just take longer for paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nUnder the sun to teach Christmas ... but you've researched relationships and how they work and how they don't work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been out for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep that relationship going what would you have said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't laugh at nine your age gap\nIs almost certain divorce statistically right not knowing each other very long these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually try not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of people don't really\nIn the corner of the the wedding who instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have larger age differences in people who are in opposite sex relationships\nBut this is not actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationships so\nThe big age difference could've been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for making comparing women and men in same sex relationship\nUp to ... and now it sounds like ... investigates the age old out of rhetoric\nBrought them back to the clinic pack front and back it's the tag

think that was you know the older hasn't yet come in but I needed to do you think that that that could be given that we are now seeing space tourism begin\nThis is a great question so I can save and the research standpoint we're pushing very hard we'd love to see this view life at least in perhaps a scaled down\nPast it better typecast within the next five to ten years we can get the technology that they're the real question is that the access up to orbit and some of the guidance and navigation controls to make sure that works\nIn terms of the the timeline for winning will be inhabited by humans at the space hotel thinking maybe ten Fifteen\nFifteen Years really that answer depends on the success of enterprises like Virgin Galactic blue origin crappy space X and they're getting into the space travel business can they supply the hotel guests for us if we have this much on the stand\n\n\nFor that space tourists infrastructure but the reality is most needed to commercial opportunities beyond depositing yet more satellites into orbit\nIs likely to come from unmanned activity robot doing stuff oh\nDenis Bush is one of the world's leading lights in the whole field is NASA's veteran chief scientist\nSpent years paving the way for the private sector explosion that we're seeing in space at the moment and he's pretty care where the low hanging\nSpace fruit is located she's\nDue to the cheaper access you can now to space manufacturing they're excellent business plans for things like fiber optics and some crystals and other things the problem is but at the cost of getting up and down and the right to worry about getting up at the\nAs we go to renewables rockets space manufacturing becomes very viable why do you want to manufacture in space was within the month because there are certain properties of the materials and the objects that are just described which are far better quality\nSo you're going out in space and creating little factories of the for the Senate\nYes yes but others say that we need to do which we can make money off is space debris\nSway spurious getting really serious we're putting up a huge number of low we'll satellite so\nTo do first observing and high speed Internet a large number of them\nSo the ... going to get worse\nWhere there's a lot of different satellites of them there's several million particles up there don't do the size of a screw in anything bigger and there's all kinds of scenarios that are getting closer to was that will wipe out the excess displays capability because things are good raise or don't want you\nTo turn to the the major problem with space debris is that everything put up in space is legally owned by somebody\nAnd therefore every screw up there as oh boy so buddy that you have to get a legal release rubble before you tortured so that has to be worked\nMy assume it will be OK debt there's what what do you do that I call it costs to the beach called me\nAnd so what you do is you go up there with a look at my ... mother which you energize either with our nuclear battery or so or you can know maneuver all around without expelling fuel\nAnd you'll just sucking in by magnetic metal

of the world's first and leading prospective space mine that's\nIn the last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general we now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons in other solar systems\nWe've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are\nPassing a tipping point where there is more private money being invested in space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved away as it as it almost always does\nAnd with those points of inside the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society to to new places\nWhat are you going to mine from a space mining standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things in transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things or you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge do a who's who may one right will to win or ice in the form of with what
