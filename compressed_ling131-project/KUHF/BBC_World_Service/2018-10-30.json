O T L\nJoining me now in the studio is Julian zealous or professor of history at Princeton University and co author of the upcoming book fault lines a history of the United states since Nineteen Seventy four\nProfessor sellers are generally and welcome to American America America on the line thanks for having me here [noise] um actually I Want to ask you about the the ... to quickly talk about what are the fault lines in uh in America since since Seventy four do they lie on on\nPolitical issues are cultural issues all of them I mean we have big political figures which we talk about every day between the two parties where the center has disappeared and where their fundamental differences in terms of what the party's stand for and the kind of politics they practice or social divisions\nAre and even though many people are optimistic about what they see at home or in their community\nOn big questions about gender about race about immigration I think we have a kind of pretty big ah areas of separation that have been growing for decades at this point and that's why they're so hard to resolve\nA and then in the economy we have literal division a of economic wealth and economic well being and that's the problem of inequality that we talk about what the thinning of the middle class\nAnd the growth of of wealthier Americans and lower class Americans and there's many divisions that are circulating ... that play into moments like these\nSo on on Saturday President Trump said quote you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past\nCan you talk about it and this was in response to um the murders in in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh and and I'm asking this question because I Want you to talk about anti Semitism in the early twentieth century and white terms like nationalist and nativist our dog whistle\nWell it's called people talk about false equivalency that often we say both sides are polarized both but if I Want to try and sort of a crazy now exactly and it it is a mistake people make there's many reasons for it\nPart of it as Republicans you know they they come of age in some ways in this era that we're talking about since the seventies so they were much better\nAt creating institutions to nurture\nThe conservative movement they they were very good at creating a conservative media and the law or the federalist society and other organizations were very sophisticated in ways that liberal didn't quite catch up a so that's part of it\nI'm going to uh to Gabriel who's calling in from Dover New Hampshire Gabriel thank you for calling into America on the line\nYou thank you for taking my call and thank you for having your show uh I just want to share\nWhat I'm most pessimistic about the lack of attention to climate change and the more and more science I mean that's been out of it and I think since the seventies and eighties\nAnd we mostly failed to act on it and what's also now are all in South America and giving up are treated in the Paris climate accord and even nuclear\nTreated just like we don't care about Chinese that are important humanity all these other devices issue you know Medicare for all isn't going to help anyone waiting for the whole planet with off and I don't know where the outrageous and I\nDon't know what's going on with the Republicans ... more facts and science thoughts for decades and she didn't get that money and energy corporation if that's the only thing that you see I don't know how we're going to change it or what we're going to do\n... ... ... finish your thought that was okay I don't\nI don't see anything changing it only seems like we're going me off my director besides maybe some private industry noticing I Know it's gonna be a big money or should back off so off for the longer we let it go on nope you make money from now\nWhen we start to realize and you can make money with solar and wind um shows are going to need it right so I'm doing something right\nGabriel thank you very much for for calling in Gabriel is calling in from from Dover New Hampshire and it made me wonder uh has made me wonder Julian\n... is is climate change or or or just ... maybe even it's the you know ignorance of factors that one of the fault lines in in where we are since Nineteen\nSeventy four I think the environment is becoming a more of a fault line in some ways I think it's the the direction was toward acknowledging this is a real problem we we we we've seen a change in public opinion and understanding that we have to deal with environmental damage\nA climate change acid rain all all kinds of different problems that we face but I Do think now it's actually getting worse a part of it is the mobilization of business against some regulations but part of it is a bigger problem of attacking the very notion of climate change which is actually gaining strength\nI and that's a problem because it's an amorphous issue for many people don't see it you don't know exactly what you're talking about\nAnd if ultimately the science is question if people questioned the very concept the divisions in this society are going to be very great not everyone agrees that it even exists let alone what to do ah so it's going to take a lot of political work to move back to where we were\nA comeback to the issue at hand and then is

Elizabeth Russia which states very specifically\nBut I kind of answer your question or a ... kind of strange shop and I'm a few weeks ago a journey she began incorporating in his campaign messaging elements of a shared rounds Nineteen eighty six divorce there were allegations of\nA kind of in the vein of domestic violence by um his wife since this kind of insinuating that maybe she exaggerated and she is a big campaign supporter of the house and Republicans in the ... campaign on that issue although interpretation but it's [noise]\nEventually became one of the main features of bringing these campaigns so kind of a combination of him being down ten Fifteen points in public points and then going really hard on this kind of an issue that Republicans have been kind of\nA a reluctant to address head on his has led to a very personally nasty race and you know you see shared around kind of almost you know I'm kind of\nGetting into his mind but I think he's kind of relishing kind of a you know insulting where they'd see during the debates have been happening here and stuff like that so it's just like I said I mean the\nUm the numbers in the race don't really support the idea that it's competitive but it's become a very contentious\nA contentious but but not competitive\nThat's again I mean I think that the the big thing there is that a Gemini she has spent about five hundred thousand dollars in campaign ads during the general election and you know a shared brown heads that somewhere in the ballpark I'd say Fifteen million dollars so I mean I don't know\nWhat the ratio is on top of my head twenty to one twenty five to one but a journey see I'm pulling it just shows a lot of Iowans don't know who gets jerked around in an office here since the late Nineteen seventies and he's he's one of the best known politicians in the states so it's just really uh you know there are some political factors that are Republicans should do well here but it's just kind of never really gotten there hasn't been an even fights\nAre there are a couple of competitive house races then I'm going to try to get to the fore for benefits that we have left um there is the first and the ... district there in the first Congressman Steve it since I mispronounced the\nName of it happened I was about to say Sambo you knew it good he's it proved possibly because of his\nUh the the cabinet bump a what's go who's his opponent in that race\nSo after a hall is the name of the guy running against shouted a he is the Hamilton County a quirk of course I think I'm blanking just off the top of my head but use the county level official in business in Cincinnati and he's a young guy he has an interesting kind of\nImmigrant story and his background and he's running very energetic race but I think that adds some of the Republican groups recognize what was happening there they've been able to deploy a lot of money and it seems that ... ah his his numbers have stabilized ... you know looks like he's in decent sufficient to be reelected at this point but you never know\nAnd in the twelfth district it's congressman Troy Balderson a who won a special election against Danny O'Connor in August to fill the seat and he has now but he has to run against O'Connor a second time to hold the seat for a full term\nRight and then since we don't a lot of time I'm not going to explain the mechanics of it but it involves retiring congressman previously held that seat but something interesting that happened there um you know it was a very close race in August there's less than one percentage point a district that Trump won by\nAround ten points and twenty sixteen um\nAnd ah but O'Connor has maintained a pretty large cash advantage since then voters then was kinda bailed out a last\nMinute then kind of some of the national Republican group seeing the opportunity that Democrats winning in a Republican district will kind of be demoralizing so they kind of the flight a bunch of money to help the owners and help them get over the top well a O'Connor or continue to have the cash and engine that race older son continues to be a weak campaign fundraiser and so\nA pro Donald Trump superPAC actually sent a million dollars so that race just last week to help out or something and so that's assigned to me that Republicans see\nA Democrat opportunity to pick up that seat still remains alive it's has a lot of the suburbs of Columbus is kinda characteristic of some of the districts that Donald Trump's and weak and other areas of the country so I I look at that as as probably the best chance for an upset in Ohio\nAnd into two minutes that will actually minute and a half that we have left the a ballot issue ballot issue one what is this about\nI mentioned it earlier um it's a constitutional amendment that would basically re classify a lot of drugs and I was young ah charger to as misdemeanors were felonies would actually reduce\nBy twenty I think by twenty five percent the sentences of people who are currently serving a sentence is on those types of crimes I mean it's it has some different factors to it\nUm and ah you see it's very well funded and I think it's kind of potentially under the radar factor where they had to get out the vote effort it's hard to know exactly who they're targeting 'cause it's not really traditional political issue right um you do see\nAn opposition um Republicans actually are basically running against it including like the wind you see a lot of judges coming out against that county prosecutors they say that it will make Ohio struggle was last week that it will um take away options from prosecutors and judges so it's it's kind of something in the background here\nOr Andrew Tobias political reporter from Cleveland dot com

moment in you said you did to about dating a white woman playing the race card who is the celebration that those old divisions I'll stand up\nFor the I think so um and like I said ... that's a lot of compositions and the fact that we can joke about these things I mean it's really like weird when people see you with like a\nWhite go in in in society like we'll look at you two seconds more than they're supposed to be looking so so I think yeah I mean I think it's a it's definitely the cause of celebration that we can talk to them in these kind of material way illegal like back when he came

particularly in ... and ... among agreeing that taboos but I think\nIs dangerous octaves risky the one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch to fuel for ... to me and as a writer living in South Africa who came here in Nineteen Ninety two I Am so that African you know I I'm a citizen of this country\nBut I'm a particular kind of citizen until I find that there are certain stories I approach with and I haven't learned how to tell them yet a lot of my main characters are a bit like me\nRight now it's on I mean the CIA has always been an issue in South Africa that all of that any to these huge ...\nI think at the moment there's a real risk you know which he used to having such a history of protests and things are connected to the struggle for freedom on many levels in South Africa and in all kinds of environments most of the opportunities for work\nFor funding to make work is from the government and I think at the moment is a real risk of self censorship so I'll just be very aware of where the opportunity to live and feeling pressure to avoid getting married since and just because those narratives wouldn't be supported financially\n\n\n\n\nAnd I walk which means here is ... ... thank you so much for joining in there on the same\nVisual all the dance moves I have used them out today we left at Thanksgiving ... we've been talking here on the outside when

do you think South Africa needs to continue to talk about the apartheid era or move on from that there's no moving on and\nI'll be talking about a particular guy [noise] um\nI mean to me it it'll lose essentially to the title of my phone which means or the title for the winter to my skin which for me as a butter reflective so that looks back at their whole life and they look at even the hardest times and they look at them and they say you know what that made me who I Am so\nYeah I think we look at a party and hopefully we'll look at it and say\nThat made us who we are as a nation so no no no no there's no there's no ending of their politics to\nTalk about what do you think I think\nThe legacy of the parties are still so evidence in determining so much of how people still live\nAnd it's still so normalized that that's the way it is\nSo I think it is to see the rent is going to be talking about I think particularly as a white person and I'm like this then against North Korea I feel like white people have also not really began to unpack\nWhat it means to be why should now and what the burden is from afar\n[noise] moving to\nWhat are your hopes for the future\nThat children

would you tell me I you know whether you believe that South Africa needs to continue to talk about a ... do we need to move on what are you know\nI think in many ways we we haven't even the gun you know and and I think you know we think we're talking to each other but mostly we talk to each other we took over\nThat we shout there's so much\nStill required in the quality of the conversations we're having generosity and understanding I think if you're beginning to see a humidity the gentler they were talking about identity politics and it's so strange about that but there's a humility that's required particularly\nFor whites are baffled that often and I feel much\nTalking and we will get somewhere but we we need to we need to keep going\nAnd do you believe the art can stop and
