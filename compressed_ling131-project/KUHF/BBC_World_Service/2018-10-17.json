Associated Press national politics reporter Hi Lisa thanks for coming on welcome to America on the line\nHi Brian thanks for having me so this just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an AP interview right how the president is comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's right our White House reporters did sit down with the president just a little while ago and we have a number of stories coming out this evening from that interview one advantage is posted online now in circulating and he said you know the president has really been I'm leaning into this idea of\nGiving and Saudi Arabia some distance from there a case that that they seem journalist and he called the um report right there in the interview he said quote you know I think we have to find out what happened first and here we go again with you're now you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that he said\nWe just went through that with justice cabin on us and this and all the way\nHe's really can Harry and Saudi Arabia\nAnd whether or not they on a ground presence and the government there Saudi Arabia of life at all\nI'm involved in the disappearance of ... the Saudi Arabians\nJournalists to have gone into the consulate there and just involved and never return dad and he um the president is Israelis sort of a questioning whether or not the government with even end often we of course have multiple reports\nUh now you know indicating that they're there may have been involved science airing it is something that is of course a massive investigation right now in Turkey I stay uncover what happened two weeks ago when a journal life went into the consulate on camera king paperwork and and never return\nWell I think Trump at different times does all of those things um I think above all Trump is a very\nSort of instinctive intuitive a politician and I think he I I wouldn't call it quite a strategy here I think he does have some sense of what has worked for him on the campaign trail and what he thinks has worked for him as president and so he kinda follows who's got and he knows that\nLashing out saying what comes into his mind or even if other presidents would have to walk it back in and have it be labeled a gaffe he knows he can kind of bluster and find his way through those kinds of statements because of the persona he's established\nFor himself people often say that we're living in an unprecedented time but historian like yourself usually push back on that\nAnd say no this has happened before I Know you wrote that a Teddy Roosevelt invented spin do do you think it's completely unprecedented the way Trump is using spin and out and outlaws and whatever else you want to label it to achieve those goals\nWell during a the two thousand sixteen campaign I got a lot of calls from reporters saying is this unprecedented and I did push back I Would point to figures like George Wallace or Joe McCarthy who would engage in the kind of demagoguery that that was working for Trump\nNow that he's president now he's been activists for almost two years\nI think we do have to acknowledge there's something unprecedented here uh I thought of with my book Republic of spin which came out in two thousand sixteen adding a chapter beyond spin to to deal with Trump because I Do think\nAh the dynamics that we had gotten used to through the Clinton Bush Obama years\nYou know now do feel a little dated we are on into some very different terrain\nAnd I know you've drawn a distinction between the Kavanaugh hearings where each side had their own truth versus yesterday when Elizabeth Warren as Trump to pay up the million dollars that he said he would pay her if she took a DNA test than it did show some Native American blood\nAnd he just said I never said that well why do you make a distinction between\nThe Elizabeth Warren and be a cabinet situations\nRight so I think in our politics today we have plenty of good old fashioned spin if I can call it that\nThe competing sense sets of part isn't talking points the different frames four interpreting the political situation uh and that's what we saw on Kavanaugh the Republicans were essentially interpreting\nThe charges one way Democrats were for the most part interpreting another way and individuals kind of had these two ah you know interpretations to choose from\nWhat Trump is doing really does recall\nThe propaganda of the communist or the fascists without saying that he deserves those labels himself but it's more of a brazen attempt you know out of George Orwell\nTo say that what you saw with your own eyes what you heard with your own ears is false and that that's different from saying I Do believe her I don't believe him\nThat's what we call ... isn't it\nWell I think gas lighting is a term that's kind of getting use now in this broader sense it's sort of originated well first with the angel is very film and so on but kind of with relationships in psychology so\nThis programming is brought to you by the reach at school and independent Catholic school for boys through eighth grade work to become scholars and gentlemen welcome Wednesday tours this fall more at the region school dot org\nAnd from NPR News this morning beginning at five on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven\n[noise]\nI'm Brian Lehrer enforced Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line orders and call in show about them is term elections we'll talk now about how the steady stream of rough and tumble news about politics and the increasing tenuous relationship of things that are said to be fat and truth\nIs affecting many of us in somewhat less than clinical terms\nThe news is making it was crazy so we brought in an expert Dr Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist who is joining us from Philadelphia\nAnd her take us neither political nor a predictable she's got so many scenarios of individuals from left right and other working through their feelings about the country today in various ways couples to so welcome Dr bound Baker\nThank you very much glad to be here\nAnd listeners will take your calls at\nEight four four seven four or five talk is\nThe news or the political environment being reported on by news outlets stressing you out how are you dealing with it are you cutting back on news are you watching more news I think we'll hear his story of that as a way to cope\nFrom August how if you're dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope or what questions might you have for a doctor Ben Baker\nAid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll do that one more time aid for for seven four or five talk um\nYou have so many interesting scenarios let's run a few before run through a few before we take some calls from listeners\nI'm One of the stories you told us off the air is one member of spousal unit is anxious so she's wanting to watch the news all the time the husband just turned off by that because watching the news is making him anxious can you talk about that couple in what they represent\nOr you can just make up numbers whatever you want to and and you can point to sources than just the belief isn't there\nWhich I also find interesting because it's all about go to school go to school go to school and now that I have this education and I try to bring it home masks none of that's real\nYeah you're the superior to me and we're not going to let you do it fall thank you so much for calling in as we continue a with Philadelphia clinical psychologist Dr Cindy down bacon on how the news is making me crazy can you expand\nA little bit on that Republicans scenario um that I mentioned before but I think we didn't really get to it\nAnd you heard from Paul about his relatives but this this reaction to the rage that liberals are Democrats have as somehow not just being different but being an attempt to silence them\nYeah well I think it's very tough I'm going to shift a little bit and and feel for the people who are Republicans right now who have lost friends those you know they really believe 'em\nWhat they believe and um the rage that I think there's reach really on both sides and whenever we're feeling rage we stop listening you know it's sort of this um nip it in the position of of rage\nBecause for a lot of Democrats and progressives it's not just this tax rate versus that ... or something like that it's if you think this you're ... you're on the ...\nYeah well it's it's shaming it's labeling I I I think of\nI'm a physician or that I Know who um\nIs a Russian descent and\nShe and her entire family ... ... I voted for the president and believe very strongly and the president um and believed that Democrats are really naive as all get out\nAnd in that case um you know there's a sense of you guys are nuts that the Democrats are going to get us you know the belief was the Democrats were going to get us into World War three\nUm and a belief that this kind of authoritarian rule um is what works so it becomes a cultural thing and this is a very good in being she's a caring physician a bug very much a Trump supporter\nLet's take another call here is Marcy and nags head North Carolina Hi Marcy\nHi thanks for having me on tell us your story um I\nCompletely relate to what the last caller said about his family I'm kind of on a different level I live in an area that\nI'm by liberal ideas are considered the minority um the way that I voted consider the minority and that's very difficult um my dad created a monster and me as far as the\nPolitical junkie and he passed away seven years ago he was a moderate Republican who and his older years\nI'm kind of adopted a lot more liberal views\nAnd we had great conversations he would listen to me rant and rave um he would give me his opinion he would agree with me on something so he was kind of like my Republican sounding board to let me know that\nSaid I wasn't crazy about some of these things and now that I'm missing that I feel like I have no one really around my husband you know agrees with me on forty vote the same way but he is an end to it as much as I Am so I feel very isolated I kind of\nTake things then I watch the news I get angry and I don't have an outlet and he has accused me of being angry especially during the Kavanaugh hearings and it wasn't even just because of the me too it was more because\nYou know he blatantly lied and they still confirmed that it was just outrageous the whole charade and I felt like I had no one to discuss it with a little bit with my husband but\nI was angry I was angry that my phone call semi senators and all that and you know and going constantly getting nothing and that's kind of what I feel I'm so waiting for November six because that kind of on holding out hope for that so\nThey could talk to my I have a I have a number of things to say here of Morsi and and you know obviously many of us felt a similarly to you [noise] um I\nI think what's made things a little bit different now to them when you and your dad used to have like a tennis game of politics\nIs that we there was a void in how we identify ourselves these days you know they used to be people identified by where they lived in what religion they were there were a variety of things and now we're in a very mobile society people aren't all that involved in organized religion\nSo that void of how we identify ourselves has been taken over by our political identifications\nAnd I think one something has to do with an identification it's very vulnerable to Shane and so we're shaming each other and that feels really quite\nAwful [noise] I I I get concerned\nAbout the blue wave in November I I Do um you know I think there might be one um but\nIf not I get concerned for the people who are pinning their hopes on it\nUm because it is a perfect example of this and I I Hope this address is it a little bit um I I went to get lunch today I was in the elevator and I wear this button that says moms demand action for gun control\nAnd this stranger in the elevator said to me you know the trouble with today is that we're in so much trouble and there's nothing we can do\nAnd that's exactly what you just said to me I feel this sense of learned helplessness like what can I Do and boy oh boy November better come around and and I feel like I can at least to have a voice again\nI'm a social media maybe plays a part for you in that you can find communities I'm that way it's not you know envy evil real time self centered and ended up getting home unity of people how social\nMedia can be both isolating and community forum and we have to take a break we'll continue with us in a minute on America Online [noise]\nSupport for Houston Public media comes from the clarion of brothers port college

the news um people are yelling at each other on the news so\nThe volume of what we're supposed to has been an uptick in that were over stimulated if you think of the screen it used to be prior to nine

then there are these shows where everybody's just yelling at each other all the time\nSo we were just in the state of over stimulation and and I think in a in a certain way\nYou know you go back to the Seventeen tweets to the president doesn't can taint his thoughts and feelings um and I think as as a reaction to that we're feeling overwhelmed and then the news media is overwhelming and these

I think that most people believe that the Saudi Government or Saudi authorities need to explain what happened\nThere were rumors here as recently as yesterday that the Saudi authorities were about to release a statement acknowledging their responsibility for his death\nAlthough whereas a exploration\nToday we saved or backtracked and they're getting the same debate tonight yet so I I I think that most people here continue to expectations of demand that the Saudi authorities or come up with a better explanation of what exactly happened\nNow speaking to us a little you know that's a former U.S ambassador General Michael Feinstein now or the middle East Institute in Washington\nNow the video streaming service Netflix continues to take viewers for traditional broadcasters because of programs like this one [noise]\nDum from [noise]\nFrom [noise]\nFrom the crown and if like me you are addicted to it that was Netflix's drama that the British royal family you can see why these numbers are growing Netflix has revealed it has added millions of new subscribers are business at present or Rob young is here how many\nYeah Netflix added nearly seven million new customers in just three months and that brings its title to move in a hundred and fifty seven million worldwide and video streaming services which Netflix is the largest all taking on\nTraditional broadcasts disliked the b._b._c. by having huge sums of money into original programming like the crown that with us is Richard ... said ... analysis Hi Richard on a limit to Netflix's grants\nWell this is definitely going to be a limit but it hasn't reached yet um say it's a nice asked me if I'm protections for the school to a continues to shy by strong growth internationally undone it's domestic market\nThat takes a spending huge sums of money on original drama and documentaries how can it food it given it Betty making any money\nI'm less rights I say the the the actual arms race the spending ahead of that means the insight\nOr if you look at them on a on a profit and loss by if they look normally profitable but actually when you look at the cash but on the spending up from ... I mean it's racing ahead to subscribe to ... and the revenue side that's why they need to keep growing to sustain that spend on ...\nRight so is it sustainable and does it get to a point when say it does rates that natural limits of people who want to pay\nSeveral dollars a month for extra programming and have good broadband that that means they can watch and decent quality does it then begin to make money ... was that when the traditional broadcasters perhaps he's a sigh of relief because that takes but how is the big threat they thought\nAnd unfortunately for the big broadcast is it like he is the big threat so Netflix is likely to continue to dating scene is gross begins to drop off in a subscriber base it would begin to increase its prices a little to come and fight for that old and it's cash\nA I'm In that will mean that it can ah can begin to look to them by the cash and piano by say\nThe broadcast is a lot of the BBC and others they they should be a little larger that yes it is the good news [laughter]\nAll right thank you Richard Richard ... from ...\nIn the meantime I'm going to watch the crown again now that ... from many thanks more business news coming up on a nice day and you're listening to and you say China and Lawrence what'd you this morning ...

one minutes ... let's go to India now and talk about the case of the ah somebody ... temple in the Indian state of Quetta which opens its doors to women of all ages today for the first time off for a ruling\nBy the Supreme Court in the country until now only women who were under ten or older than fifty ... able to enter the issue is ... being of reproductive age\nNow there'll be protests against the ruling hundreds of extra police are on alert us\nOr many a Hindu devotees around you that it goes against the teachings of the traditions of that religion or two thousand years that tradition has been in existence\nA jolly George ah started ... ready to wait a campaign by women who believe that the decision to allow in old women is wrong and she joins us now on Charlie welcome to the program as a woman why are you against allowing older women into the temple give us a quick round up of your position\nOn average ... that's the thing is that this is not about demonstration or the age manipulation Egypt of all men but they did about that diet the independent but\nAt each time but it has its own dynasty and each diabetes different in each character and it's a wants and desires\nSo that this particular time British offered him a lot of your part in but the idea of this them but it is that oh it's only in this them but so that did this ... is an aesthetic ... young a teenage boy who can do up to the human and isn't the meditation and he is following\nA nice take up much idea which is a mind they do they eat up all a wolf celibacy which he needs\nTo be going right into his okay right right so ... you know your point is that it's particularly about the day at the who was was shipped in this temple can I ask about the plight principal because I Know that the country's Supreme Court has made similar decisions in other temples do you think that they would rights to do that in the case of the other temples\nHere in this particular a judgment of the Supreme Court access they blindly off a blanket blanket they gave it blanket us like don't do that all kind of\nThat's fiction and the rules and regulations relate that to women in ... and ... and get this particular state of the law which is if it's not just this one time but so that they didn't completely analyze the\nUh the the scheme do side of Hindu point of view point of view and a a rail or things that you know they they didn't look at ... ... ... people\nRight now I understand that and I one thing that has been reported in the news agencies is that some women are being stopped from traveling now do you support that kind of action people being pulled off buses people are being demonstrated against I mean I Know that you've started a hash tag\nAt maybe ... is from our BBC um hiring service in Nairobi and I spoke to her earlier\nOr the prime minister downsized dentistry in office I'm twenty two twenty a and which many streets such as governmental a communication authors are obviously dissolved a and the reason he gave it as close minimization to an institution to ... and also to get the rest of the people and\nIt comes to government institutions but I don't think shoveling the carbonate and downsizing the ministry of his is a is not a new thing\nAnd then you find them in a is a half of the minister said women including a the key positions so such as Ayesha Mohammed or appointed us the minister of defense or and she's the first woman to hold such position and the country's history\nAnd ... who served as the speaker of parliament for the past five months as well ... it's a new port a portfolio\nAnd it's very ... whole portfolio while I understand that she's in the hierarchy in the grand scheme of things she's right after the prime minister\nYeah yeah uh so should be overseeing the countries and not only she's not only the minister but should be overseeing the country's intelligence on security apparatus and also including the federal police commission so it's it's it's very powerful and yeah like you said it's a within the country is not a hierarchy should come after the prime minister\nAnd the prime minister made really interesting comments about well how about why he chose I'm half of his cabinet or to be women what did he say\nA so basically what she said is a women are less corrupt and they'd respect their jobs\nYeah and also to break a conspiracy or politics which dominated the county that in the past a a a a decade or so when he that's why he actually are both women into\nPower it's interesting though because it's an interesting generalization ... beginning what he's trying to say I'm bringing women along because they work hard and the and they're not corrupt and while some woman might find that flattering others might say well actually you know men and women can can be corrupt what's been the reaction to this comment\nSo I was actually monitoring social media and there were discussions among feminist start guns\nAre saying are being ... gender a somewhat criticizing his speech for using a stereotype and ... I mean that's the ... the notion\nThat women are less go up to the respect their jobs but they're also parts of the system and the I think it's some misconduct ... I'm a that's a what ... saying but also a an addition to that some men who are saying yeah\nLet's see also a women holding disposition Z\nAh ah yeah [laughter] oh maybe things might be different\nI mentioned it to know what the reaction has been to the women holding these key positions as you say the minister of defense minister of peace basically responsible for ... intelligence and police what has been the reaction to their employment ... people generally been positive or questioning their qualifications for these positions\nI mean so far people are delighted about this intimate but with the uh with the ministry of defense suspicion that people are raising the question of a good ... and her performance\nI think this is sort of a double standard because the ... quest and when not raised with the former minister of defense or see that's where the guy who did not have any ... uh the background\nThey Selassie take out all their from our BBC America service on the reef shuffle and half of the minister ministers in Ethiopia's new cabinet now are women [noise]\nI was very important meeting of the world Health Organization it's experts that you're going to decide on the committee responsible there's got to decide something that might sound a bit technical but bear with us we will try to explain whether or not the ... outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes a public health emergency of international concern\nIn W. H. O. language basically that means it is an extraordinary event and uh the suspicion is that there is a danger to the disease mice spread across borders and requires a vigorous international response to\nThe center of the government's response to the current outbreak is the ... ... ... who joins us now minister first off\nOn the conditions on the ground can you tell us or what is the latest that you are hearing in terms of casualties on whether you feel it is a situation which is still escalating\nFor good morning\n\nTo order the fiction and the person in this and fifty seven survivors awful so far I think that the situation\nIs it all and we are working in a tool to go so far as I think the real issues under control\nOkay in that case come on us when it comes to the W. H. O. deciding whether they should call it as a public health emergency do you would you recommend that they should do that and what difference would it make on the ground\nSo from my point of view on international trade and frustration\nBut I Would feel much discouraged genes we've been working on that because she's ... if you read working as quickly as possible and it's all the children\nHave been going on in my job you can you imagine you're so often that they've been able to manage our rivers in its own lives and for weeks and described\nRisk the virus hasn't spread in neighboring countries or memory Harvey right I think that\nThe people doing it rich jobs despite all the challenges and the this is a bunch of rich attrition is particularly because the phrase beginning of restructuring into resistance but even on that front much horrific\nWell the space community resistance and also the armed groups operating in the area as well um but when the old neighbors be happy to hear you say that as far as you're concerned it's under control because they will be extremely worried about it crossing borders\nAre they satisfied with with your uh your assurances\nThat from the beginning of the risk spreading it for good record your country is up in your research there seems to be able to come in and\nAnd we have throughout Europe turning working at the port of entry so I think people are really going to take on\nI'm sure I'm sure I'm sure a great deal is being done ... I I just need to have to ask you pure and simple do you want the W. H. O. to call it a public health emergency will not\n[noise] not too long because since the beginning it's a risk and managing it as a as a big risk and wonder if you want it on anything\nFrom the response working governor trees were younger you are rich or you have your own up to the beginning of the country is just not a government response it's already an international response and good either she broke her government\nWell I Want to thank you for coming on and giving us the lay system for health minister\nOf ... about the situation I'm In the Democratic Republic of Congo as regards above the\nAh he was paying tribute to close to the many people who are fighting it both from the government an NGO sides but are you saying there of course there's still cultural difficulties that many people are alarmed by people coming in in hazmat suits the kind of advice that they'd given on burials\nAnd also that uh individually armed groups that some of whom have attacked the a ... as well thanks to minister ...\nYou're listening to it and you stay on the b._b._c.

kind of take the cuisine traditions with them a New York based companies employing women chefs from Syria Iraq and Afghanistan to cater for dinner parties and corporate events it's called ... and it's owned and run by a chef an entrepreneur Goldberg\nI think after the two thousand sixteen presidential election I like most of the people I Know we're looking for ways to be more politically involved\nUm you know to express our general dismay with the direction that our national conversation seemed to be taking 'em and I having worked abroad always traveled to eat and learn about different cultures through their foods\nFor me in aligning myself with the refugee costs felt like a very natural set 'em and I knew that there were a lot of things going on you know worldwide but also in New York City I'm Around refugees and food which I mean just made all the sense in the world because\n[noise] you know because of the way it brings us together and emphasizes our commonality\nUm and so I just felt like it was a place where my skills that could really be a value on and so I started hosting at first just fundraising dinners for various um Syrian refugee related causes in my home\nAnd I started discussing the project with the various resettlement agencies around the city and telling them what sort of women I was looking for and I'm over the course of the spring and summer of two thousand Seventeen we built our team\nAnd how does your team where would you do you put on meals maybe as you mentioned it begins with meals in your home how's it expanded kind of things you ...\nOh sure so um we continue to do our pop up dinners but we also there was a refugee food in arts festival put on during the U.N General assembly week last year and we sort of headlines Adam participated in that and you know we've grown a real community so people you know for their birthday parties for that Christmas parties for\nFor any sort of ... and a half our fundraisers I'm now delegates yesterday or catering and I'm so we've done that as well and then also last winter we added cooking classes\nRunning really so you ... do you kind of so you can say one of the time yes yeah so tell me how you find the women of the rule refugees they're all based in New York and presumably they will have to have skills\nBut for the most part there were just really talented home cooks you know when I went around to the agencies and kind of described what I was looking for I said you know it's it's the woman whose eyes light up when she talks about food you know not just some you'd put dinner on the table because\nIt's part of her responsibility to do that for a family that women who were really excited about food you know and immediately the context of the agencies would smile you know oh yeah I Know exactly what you should talk to you there's always someone who's bringing food into the office who who just can't stop herself from you know putting putting putting something delicious in your book\nOn a couple of songs do have I mean is there a language barrier stew and those who'd get around that\nYeah absolutely um you know it depends some of the women with whom I work are more fluent than others on you know with the woman I work with from Syria you know English is remains pretty pretty limited and so we always work with her daughter who so lovely ... help her in a translator with us\nUm and with my my uh cook from Iraq six pretty excellent English and is a huge personality and I'm\nA woman a from Afghanistan her English has evolved

they have access in the clinic or they welcomed a it's the young girl in particular protected from having a baby too soon\nAll of this implies that choice could change a life that could change the

don't have the control over when to marry one to have a child there there's still a great deal of gender discrimination of depriving many women have the power of that choice\nThe heart of the matter is exactly the men and women are equal but women are the ones that are disadvantaged when choices taken out of their hands\nNot only the information but the services and the expectation that a girl should be able to fulfill her potential this is what the report is showing very clearly\nWere falling back and we can't sit back and relax and things and things of the job is done in that regard we need to bring\nContraception services understanding to young people in particular they're the ones who are not going to be able to reach the job market they're the ones who are not going to be able to

millions of players across the world now for the initiation Fortnite is a collaborative shoot 'em ups survival game essentially\nIt's also a big money generator and now the creators at the game you're selling one player Brandon Lucas who was posted videos online on how to cheat while playing the game\nSo how big of a problem is it when the online video get within the online video game industry let speech Ellie gets in video games journalist who joins us in Studio ... have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you have to ... to pay any money to play the game it's done I think I'm I think one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to look for people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars\nAnd that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing and but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and waiting to find that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes a brand new cars is accused of making these tax to the game and sending them\nAnd these are ... to cheat basic cake so he's made me think who ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you to medicate\nSo he's been sending these molds to the game online\nAnd I'll put the two hundred pounds in some cases wow and you know and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software at a Fortnite\nThat's right that base accusing these papers copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one though surely at the games should be targeting everyone who doesn't\nSlip is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believed at some fat he says they're not not of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic have them in care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nItself as it's not even a fast food night really they vote yeah they they had some people arrested I think in um uh this is a different game actually play online bustle grounds and but it hasn't been arrested in China for hiking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating in games\nAnd like many things he gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit mono a twenty two minutes possibly out now Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalized recreational marijuana consumption on

still getting together while you get more than three like some of our [noise] they got\nThat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [noise] finally there was one thing I'd be wanting to ask you one since I don't write\nSomething that had been playing on my mind since I first found out I was heading into the studio with a minute ... music for some of the biggest ... games in the world if you press the mute button on dying to not be I don't think you would enjoy it as much\nBut I music dialogue or same defects you'd struggle to understand the drama\nBut you can ... Boston New ones work I'm Still understand and enjoy the game\nSo having just played the game myself I we noticed that uh\nThat there's actually a mute button for the sign for the whole game but there's also a mute button just for the music so you can have the the side effects I D I Do you feel about that do you feel about was necessary for them to piece in was that your idea\nNo not at all [laughter] and I don't know how it came to be but I'm I understand if you're on a bus or something you don't want to know about other people\nSo it's it's inevitably alone process for all you know from conception\nTo barked so to speak\nGive hides a brief you ended up going to be the past you've recorded a orchestra you've recorded on Oprah choir so Lewis choir\nYou'd mixed several different versions of it you've done a hundred and fifty same defects\nAnd yet after a whole lot people might still tons of musicals how you feel\n[noise] yeah I mean I'm I Can't do anything about it I'm fine with it but hearing you mean when you put it that way\nIt feels like a ... totally out of the music on and but I Would think that anyway but ah yeah that's I've put down some effort to it I guess and uh\nYeah I Would hope they appreciate the news\nDoesn't upset you that\nPeople will occasionally\nNo I mean it's their\nDecision has their own loss that experience as a whole is\nDale and audio and they have the whole\n[noise] um [noise]\nGet it presumably I mean people switch off not necessarily because they don't like the music\nISIS within which they're playing the game yeah think of as\nI tell myself but it's sad\nBut I I'd say I you know you have to be honest I mean if you play the game and I've\nI've got so much nights you know nice comments from people from all of the world loving the missing in that that\nThat really warms my heart but you got to be honest and if you have the same three minute three thirty whatever it is music and you play that game for let's say hundred too I Would throw around three hundred hours or so you will end up\nGetting fed other there's no way avoiding it yet but you know I I Try my\nFeel good as long as [noise]\nTo have the tools to do as\nYou know have to you know ... sometimes I entered this through this my office\nAnd it's [noise]\nI like being here\nAre still I like the freedom this job crates I mean I [noise]\nIt's it's a U.S you know\nSometimes I go out\nGet creativity from nature or whatever and I feel I've you know I've got their pertinent to do that here or\nNo one bothers me or complaints as long as I deliver\nSome quite content I Hope that will stay here I could say for the rest of my life but as long as I work I Would love to hear\nI can imagine [noise]\nSomething better than this so creative and\nI get to do what I Love which is\nYou've been listening to in the studio with Johan homes from\n... and this has been on audio all was production by Chelsea Dickinson ...

I've been very surprised that\nThe United kingdom for on its side I'm greatness is so if you're like under threat that it's Europe is pushing it I mean that is an extraordinary statement for bars Johnson to make the European Union for all its flaws works on the basis that around the table I remember I come from the flow member state we do have the RG biology\nBut we respect each other's positions we know we need to compromise and we have to move forward what I Would like to see from those who am I Am the bars chunks and a team and I'm not so sure of the phone numbers but you'd have the facts on that is\nWhat do they propose other than to walk away and when you walk away nothing is it changed it might we've had a fight that innate\nGive somebody a kid but it doesn't actually solve the problems for business for supply chain\nThat was ... and ... that you're going to happen\nIn a moment but but if I may just just to continue the mold about Boris Johnson's passion as it was expressed in that very reason newspaper called him what he is getting at is that\nFor his policy which after all just couldn't pull the conservative and union is policy there is something fundamental at stake which is ensuring the continued unity of the United kingdom and they look at what comes out of your own\nCountry Ireland when it comes to an analysis of wherever it tradition they listen to statements like the one from your prime minister leader your party over to the other day wasted our job as an Irish Government has to look out for the interest of the entire\nIsland of Ireland Denise Brexit negotiations you should we are the party of Europe\nAnd we all the night to Ireland partying and it sounds to some conservative and unions politicians is what you have an agenda and your party and indeed in your country which is to see what's happening in Britain sit as a prelude to Irish unification\nBut breakfast has nothing to do with a lot of that the reason why our land and ... leader has a role to play in relation to the north of artist is because of the good friday agreement I mean all governments have a role to play and that's because no they're not it is a unique entity we've had\nViolence that I mentioned to my own childhood we have to pay for Twenty years we have tried to build bridges between coming in to see that\nIn a way we're very divided and\nSadly because of Brexit those divisions are beginning again be very careful and I'm just on a United are into that can only happen with the will of the people of northern\nAre actually one of the island of our hands if he has not remote and they\nCan get is not on the agenda now whatsoever and I think to make it um and I've\nLived here for the game the conservative in ... the ... is being put on the agenda in Iowa and let me quote you Mary Lou McDonald just today the leader of shouldn't be saying she says that if there is a no deal Britain's it has far she concern is concerned the damage\nWill be so severe that all the people of Ireland we will not stand idly by they will have to be a board across the border poll on unification it doesn't matter what the origin\nThis programming is ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the flying detriment story of a quest for true love open season it restored for them to bring nineteenth through November second Houston grand opera dot org\nDisciplined by the EU commission the ISI Jay and others it won't work\nI Know but I've ...

windy quite cold that's it and it's also it's a little dragging ... around us it what the appeal I think\nThey're an amazing tool it started as a hobby for me\nMany years as a producer at CNN and when I saw what you could do from the air it really just\nGave a whole new dimension to the production that I was trying to do and then I actually went out of my own and started a business now everything from industrial surveying and mapping to firefighting and law enforcement\nFilm and television you can really do it all and with the same equipment can I have a guy absolutely this is from the BBC and she wants to fight or you know there are about to do that right now [noise]\nOn the screen hair what we're able to see is the actual image from the camera but what we're able to do is tap zoom to a certain point out that takes series apps in India and actually goes all the way back out\nAnd now and can show that I don't think is that if I could compete that gave the doesn't that yeah the remote itself is very capable if I said oh well yeah I mean it just ... she flies\nWhen it's condensing not to set the record I see yeah oh yeah they're all she rode out are all she alright yeah\nThere'll be timing there with man slowed and CEO of the Atlanta drone group well of course the light weight airborne toys may be good for all kinds of stuff like delivering smoke particles will aerial photography but they haven't been able to carry heavy payloads yet but I could be about to change\nWe're making a a single person aircraft that can take off and land vertically it can also Dr the side of a building it really is a sports car of the sky we want to make the sexy and the fast vehicle that's really cool and fun to fly\nThat Steve tidbits he's CEO of ... era one of the dozens of starts off ... around the world using ... technology to piling in the air flying lightweight vehicles he plans to have his first prototype embolden about a year\nInitially it'll be the early adopters in the you know people who have a lot of disposable income and somebody that might have previously bottle Lamborghini now they can have one of our zero vehicles and fly with it how much would it cost a hundred and forty thousand dollars is estimated in Mississippi\nThat's a lot of money but it's not a lot of money compared to a helicopter I guess\nUh it's about the same as a fully loaded Tesla so\nYou know there you go there both electric vehicles so this is\nGreat I guess if you live on a raunchy and you want to get up to the top of the hill and maybe come down again it's not great if you want to go from you'll suburban home to the office because\nYou're not allowed to do that now with one of these machines\nThat is true but we think both of the air traffic control in the technology and the regulations will catch up to the developments that you know the the regulations always lag technical development so ah we think that that eventually catch up and there'll be guidelines and rules that will allow people to fly in urban urban is\nUm ... very few owning a leads test pilots on the home of had the opportunity to experience this type of and travel [noise]\nSounds like an ... but still the BBC's guy de ... did get his Charles recently on another present times [noise]\nThey raise the whole ... I'm sitting in it right now it's very very simply had just two controls one for altitude most of the direction of weather stinking guys around me you'll say there are ten ... ten most is that keep

will keep it going for around twenty minute that would improve and find my son he make our foster right now but just to be cautious that keeping it around six small brow was sitting in many people think\nIs a glimpse of the future they say that goal is to eliminate traffic and I also don't think many of us get behind whether it will be in one of these that remain the same but it's definitely a very very interesting a futurist [noise]\nInteresting interesting finding\nTerrifying I think what do you reckon the early prototypes unlikely to be part of it but pretty soon they could actually be flying soda or ... still flying\nWould you be willing to commit to one of those and fly over a city official certification but vehicles like these in cities has not yet been granted but\nIt could be sued I'll Steve right he's associate professor in aerospace engineering at the University of west of England I met some of the current obstacles that are holding back the regulators hit its\nSay well from the case of high technology is the things that ... and the things a low cost easy so books are blocked pricing a high rise environment that's not too bad that's not too much of a problem in fact they're pretty ... pretty good\nThe biggest problem we go and buy a hammock chair and itchy can we cram into a box [laughter]\nSo we engineers we've been spoiled rotten for the last hundred and fifty is by this stuff cool\n... hydrocarbon feel\nIs a huge amounts of energy enough that can give us a huge in here and in other words we fly for several hours at the moment it's sort of technology we've got\n... the ocean is probably any good for about half an hour all three coots there now so that doesn't give us the safety margins it would be somebody within the past so in other words the performance that we see is excellent\nThe issue is trying to make that happen over a long period of time since ...\nProfessor Steve right will pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two\nCould double flying time all the same some of those involved in driving the new tech like engineering barge trip star top ... to go Arab uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an onboard generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who were the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries but we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then you\nThis is a hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft some of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft\nBut also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted\nAircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus splits in Europe you worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now\nWhat I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones with vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic check cities in the well a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have perhaps low regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nWell Canada has ten provinces three territories and as you said the rules very and are there you know cities or territories that are against this that are trying to maybe push back against it with their own restrictions\nThere are definitely some jurisdictions that are being more conservative with their rules provincially\nThat's taken the former mainly of restricting where you can consume um there's some\nProvinces where you can only consume ... in your own home for example um whereas a lot of others are making it kind of like smoking cigarettes where wherever smoking's legal then you can smoke marijuana um as long as you're not in your children or you know at the wheel of a car or something like that\nWhat we've yet to see is what municipalities will do because a in a lot of provinces municipalities are being given the power to enact even more stringent rules and that has yet to play out um I think we'll see that in the next few months or how various a local government spies\nAnd we said that happened here in Colorado for instance there began to be concerned about how close a seller could be to school so I'm sure some of that's going to unfold that we understand that\nIn provinces without a regulated retail framework Canadians can purchase marijuana on line but has to be from a federally licensed producer and there has to be secure home delivery\nUm you have to be at least Eighteen and older in Canada to buy recreational marijuana starting today but some provinces have made the age Nineteen\nMhm so so Eighteen is the baseline that set out in the\nFederal law but provinces are given the power to you know raise that age if they want to and a lot of them have aligned it with what they are legal drinking age is a so in a lot of promises that's Nineteen or there's a few that have kept it at Eighteen so we're going to see a lot of those same variations that there are four considering drinking alcohol\nAnd how much can you buy and how much can you grow now that it's legal\nSo under the federal law um you can have up to a thirty grams of of dried candidates or equivalent in in non dried\nYou can grow up to a four plants per home for personal use 'em but again those are all things at least at the number of plants that can be restricted further by promises and there are a few that have said that you actually can't grow any for herself\nWas a huge difference in Canada is that this is a federal law and the government itself the government of Canada is going to oversee the production manufacturing so\nThe fact that the federal government is involved means that banks can be involved here in the United states it's the states that are allowing it one by one but the federal government still outlaws it's so banking\nIs it because of the big problem with what to do with the money that flows from it just doesn't seem like it's going to be a problem in Canada\nUm there there's a huge spotlight on the marijuana market in Canada there has been for quite some time it is looking like it's going to be big business um the stocks have all been skyrocketing up until today\nUm today you know it's a bit of a shaky start and you don't really quite know how that's going to play out there's a lot of fears about um a a bubble of marijuana bubble because you know while there are estimates as to what the market is going to look like we actually don't really know what the demand is yet\nAnd so I think
