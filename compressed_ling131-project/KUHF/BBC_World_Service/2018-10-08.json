U. H. F. Houston and K. U. H. T. T. V. eight point six used to a service of the University of Houston I'm Jared Carol and this is news eighty eight seven\nFrom Texas Public radio this is Texas matters a weekly radio news magazine that looks at the issues events and people in the Lone Star state\nToday on Texas matters it's the most powerful political office in Texas but the two major candidates for lieutenant governor will not be meeting in a debate so who is my colleague here the Democratic challenger we have two\nVery different points of view on very important issues would\nFace Texans this is Texas matters from Texas Public\nRadio I'm David Martin Davies the lieutenant governor is said to be the most powerful politician in Texas because he has so much control over the state Senate Republican Dan Patrick has used that office to further his social conservative vision for the state\nI'm a Christian first a conservative second Republicans or\nMy faith means everything to\nThat's why I've placed in God we trust in the Senate and under God and our state I help build the first president seminary in Texas and pass the sonogram bills that could say Fifteen thousand babies lies this year I honor God's not government\nThat's while fight against Obama's attacked\nAll the taxes conservative values\nAnd then governor but businessmen my Collier says he wants to be the next lieutenant governor of Texas and he's the Democrats nominee I spoke to Collier about his vision for Texas and what he's offering voters were also reaching out to Patrick in\nOffering him equal time\nYeah so my name is Mike Collier and on the Democratic nominee for Texas lieutenant governor and uh I don't hold office I'm an accountant to certify both ... and I have some ideas as to how to solve some of these big problems we face in the states such as public education funding and property taxes so how did you come to be the candidate for lieutenant governor [noise]\nWell I uh my story starts for when I ran for ... years ago and uh so I decided I've always felt like\nA government work a lot better if our politicians had a skilled and the private sector minds finance and accounting if they offered it up for the public good did good work don't stay too long I've always felt that and I decided that I Would\nOffer my skills and my services as the candidate for controller because we have a real problem with public education funding in property taxes in the state and\nAnd so I diagnose the problem in a random basis and it was four years ago but the party a were very supportive of me and they asked me to stay involved in to run again and the party asked me to run for lieutenant governor which brings us to the president\nAnd you're challenging the incumbent Dan Patrick or the Republican who holds the seat now what's wrong with with Dan Patrick's all about\nWell he and I are two very different points of view in terms of what comes next in the state I'm very pro public education\nAnd anti vouchers and a damn Patrick is pro vouchers and so by definition he's not as pro public education as I Am and we could talk about that at like uh in terms of school funding we have a real problem with school funding in in the way we handle school funding it driving her property taxes\nThrough the roof and so I have a plan to begin to resolve that and then Patrick or has failed to resolve the property tax problem it's gotten much worse in his twelve years in government ah\nThose are the two major issues also I Believe we should expand Medicaid I think that's a very good deal for Texas then Patrick as opposed to expanding Medicaid and there are other areas but we're very different people when it comes to what comes next to the state\nYou know nobody's talking about it are worried about it because it's not real except when Dan Patrick flaps his jaws about it and he's trying to do it for political reasons and let me say this you know we have a real school safety issue\nAnd gun safety issue it wouldn't would not call a special session\nOur schools are no less dangerous now than they were when Santa Fe happened he would not call a special session for that but he usually like Governor Greg Abbott who calls a special session well I mean let's talk about that the governor causes special session and governor actually suggested that we have a special session related to gun safety after they headed round table\nBut he said they will only be a special session if there's a political will to get something done and Dan Patrick said there is no political will we will not do it so there was no point in calling a special session that true lieutenant governor does not have the legal authority to call a special session but the lieutenant governor can demand the special session and then Patrick he's done the exact opposite\nSo and so one day Patrick is talking about he's going to protect the second amendment gun rights is this what he means is what he's talking about\nWell let's talk about the second amendment or you know I'm a gun owner right so I you know when I was younger I was a deer hunter my dad and I used to go deer hunting and I've got the rifle that I bought using paper out money I liked that rifle or a and I'm pro Second Amendment all the way\nAnd background check system that works is consistent with the second amendment\nAs is a red flag law and that's what the governor said that we should be considering an expert Texans want including many Republicans are because we've got to do something sensible ah about gun safety\nDamn Patrick block that and that is inconsistent with the will of the state and it's not a Second Amendment argument you can have a red flag law just as we already have other laws\nAre related to gun safety are that are consistent with the second amendment\nRed flag laws me that there are indicators to show that this is a person who would be a danger to himself or others ah it's in other states of it seems to be a trend But Dan Patrick is opposed\nWell let's think about what how a red flag law actually works I mean you must protect the second Amendment rights that's essential the red flag laws do that uh we let me put it to you this way we already have laws on the books for example that's that's if somebody's a convicted of violent crime with a handgun they are not allowed to carry a gun\nThat laws already on the books were all living comfortably with that no one is claiming that's inconsistent with the second amendment what a red flag law is says that you can accelerate that process so if you think that somebody is a danger to themselves or others and you have competent evidence of that and you take it before an independent judge\nThe independent judge can issue in order that temporary until you decide whether or not there should be some sort of permanent injunction and so really all it is is taking the laws that are on the books as we find them and accelerating the process which I think it's perfectly sensible\nThis is Texas matters I'm David Martin Davies I'm speaking with my colleague here the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor another Dan Patrick position is securing the border what a securing the border I mean to you Mike Collyer democratic candidate for lieutenant governor\nWe all agree that we should secure the border we all agree that we should control the border we all agree that we must enforce the laws of the United states of America the difference between me and Dan Patrick is that we should be intelligent about it so we should do what works uh and we should be humane about it I mean there's no question about it this notion that we tore children away from their families\nWell you're right it was a Democrat there's going to be partisan politics if you when your office there'll be partisan politics in in the capital particularly when it comes to the fact that I'm\nMost likely to be a Republican majority of the Texas Senate and you've got to figure out a way if you win the office to ah create bills that are going to I guess compromise\nThe number one problem in the legislature is leadership in my opinion and um you know just dress for example was the kind of leader I really like just ask 'em wish you were still there you found with his leadership the house was much more sensible\nI mean the house proposed increase in funding for public education Republicans in the house proposed increasing a funding for public education jokes for that the problem in the Senate is Dan Patrick\nSo once Dan Patrick's gone then the more moderate element of the Senate can express their point of view and I think we can begin to solve these problems and I'm really quite confidence it will do well\nYou're also have come out in favor of campaign finance reform and redistricting would that look like\nWell let's talk about gerrymandering which is my highest priority because I have a specific plan to deal with ... other states have done this gerrymandering is the root cause in my opinion of all of our political difficulties in the country it prevents our leaders from compromising it it requires our leaders to become hyper partisan in a way that none of us\nPrefer so we must kill gerrymandering before gerrymandering kills democracy Texans are ready for this we should do and other states have done a perfect model and to create an independent redistricting commission was that'd be a very high priority of mine is lieutenant governor is politically doable now so we'll do that first\nI also think that we need to reform a campaign finance a that will be something I intend to work on a in due course uh it's not a first step on the agenda because gerrymandering is for stuff on the agenda and it's a much more complicated issue\nAnd I think before I just race out and and share my point of view as to what the right answer is I'd like to involve other people into thinking I can tell you in terms of my campaign\n[noise] uh I'm not taking money from packs a with a couple of exceptions the Texas ... certified public accountants of which I'm a member has contributed to my campaign as have ah some of the labor unions supported by AFL CIO proudly uh I'm not a soliciting pac money otherwise not receiving pac money otherwise\nThis week we're going to folks and the response to the crisis and ask if the way that governments handled it made things better or worse [noise]\nSame thing I'm not saying we don't we [noise]\nThe u._s. it's estimated that the crisis cost at least twenty thousand dollars for each person and overtime results in the loss of Fifteen billion dollars of national wealth equivalent to almost one year's economic activity\nThe greatest pain has been felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market Jeff Smith executive\nThe ... Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis in the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started to most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration\nOf subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to foreclosure you had a lot of vacant abandoned meant in those neighborhoods and I was really concentrated you know a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis that house itself\nWas likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value their property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI also Jeff what happened to these people\nForeclosure is a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very significant numbers of these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car or for a mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job easy if you can get a apartments so it was a big event that had a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed home ownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings\nHomeownership rates for the under forty five times to sharply since the crash over forty percent of housing wealth is now held by the over sixties compared to own your calls it before the crash poor and middle income families and young people have not benefits from the increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for a certain components of the economy has improved and you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is continuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered\nFrom the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments the families who live there struggle for finding employment and Ford will housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago and I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is a growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources that have been getting a better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\n[noise] the growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and moved the dynamic cities with a new job such we found combined with the\nFact that the U.S government spends one six of the average of other advanced countries on labor market retraining has reduced ability of people to escape their predicament\nBetween Nineteen Seventy in two thousand people have been a hundred and forty seven countries experience banking crises two thousand age was the mother of all crises in the severity and globally impacts\nAveraging comes in the rich world which the grunt uninterrupted since the second world will fail the U.S economy was within three is about a third smaller than it would have been had they not being a crisis [noise] this was despite the fact that the U.S in boxing the stimulation package\nWhich sought to minimize the impact professor Joseph Stiglitz was received a Nobel Prize for economics explains the reasons\nWhenever a car to me is hit by a crisis economy goes down drafts revenues go down often expenditures have to go out for unemployment welfare benefits\nAnd so even countries with surpluses wind up having deficits and even more if you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks [noise]\nHistorically there have been many instances where government seeing that deficit say that deficit will result in a loss of confidence we have to get rid of the deficit the way you get rid of the deficit is cut back expenditures which is called us therapy\nFor raise taxes but actually really hard to do the middle of a downturn\nHerbert Hoover who was the president when the stock market collapsed in Nineteen twenty nine\nUsed austerity and I credit him with converting the stock market crash into the great depression\nThe Obama administration had learned the lesson that the renowned British economist John Maynard Keynes drew from the great depression sooner after Obama became president in early two thousand in line Congress approved the seven hundred and eighty seven billion dollar American recovery and reinvestment act\nWhich aims to spur consumer spending and restore investor confidence through a combination of tax credits increases in welfare payments and cheap loans for businesses\nIn addition the Federal Reserve pumping money into the economy to reduce interest rates in an experiment known this quantitative easing that also was adopted in the u._k. and Europe in the U.S over four trillion dollars was added to the money supply in this way and\nThen you can Europe at least ... trillion\nCanes great work address the question was should have been done and the answer is not austerity but stimulation\nWhat happens in economic downturn is people get fearful they are spending and except vicious cycle is that now spend the economy gets weaker and austerity is a downward spiral\nIn Nineteen twenty nine governments acted like people and when times got tough then reduce spending but while it's rational for people to tighten their belts in tough economic times came showed that if governments did the same that would make mashed his father was\nAn governments needs to overcome fear an economic contracts and by spending to reignite demand\n\nIn Europe and the u._k. like in the U. S. canes approach also was adopted first and when the G twenty finance ministers were convened by the vent prime minister Gordon Brown in April two thousand nine they agreed to one trillion dollar stimulation package\nAnd the European Commission agreed additional spending over two hundred billion euros [noise]\nThe Nineteen countries to show the single European currency the euro sooner forced to reverse course [noise]\nPlus killing me before Mickey you commissioner identifies the contagion that led to the wall street panic spreading to Europe\nThe level of death in many European countries all of a sudden look too high\nThe euro crisis was a consequence of the U.S a crisis\nRoots of the euro crisis that the EU financial system\nHas a quarter of a sovereign holding a sovereign bonds probably debt them and that the quality of the object that was hit by the crises not least because of repeated rise of indebtedness of European countries on stage in order\nTo bump into the economy which was the ... and to be expected reaction now\nFive eurozone countries cypress Greece Ireland Portugal and Spain has to go begging bowl in hand the IMF and European Central bank which imposed further cuts to bring national income in line with the expenditure\nThe result was that Europe experienced a double whammy hit first by the collapse of the financial system as contagion spread from the U.S and then my self imposed austerity\nThe moment banks stopped to pay you know the Republicans ... in the financial system and given the huge amount of cross holding in the financial system so that triggered him a financial crisis in Europe and the experience showed that the way the ... you had been buried the euro house\nWas not be so deeply enough to where they are such a shock and this had to be on the jury and the crises\nEurope's crisis was brutal your area economic activity fell by roughly one point four trillion euros that's about the size of the entire economies of Spain and the Netherlands\nFinland Portugal Spain Italy and Greece have yet to reach the levels of economic activity they had ten years ago\nThe advanced economies the political consequences if Mr Ritchie have been rising public anger and support for extreme parties wage growth in advanced economies ten years off the crisis it's the quota of what it was before\nThis crisis was unusual as for the first time since the great depression eight years before it started in the advanced\nBut its impact was global the share of children living in ... households increased by over ten percent in countries as diverse as island Croatia lack fear Greece the U.S and Mexico\nI almost uncool Korea who was the Mexican minister of economy about the impact on his country of the financial crisis\nOh we had a very serious impact because uh the girl just evaporated we worked a mid sized very open economy depending very crucially on trade and investment flows and of course a country where the level of savings was not enough\nSo it needed the savings from abroad meaning foreign direct investment\nIt also needed the technology et cetera and all these flows which were part and parcel of our daily lives stopped cold and of course a country like Mexico certainly of course felt this impact it was very harsh very hard the buck was very serious and I couldn't we still living with the consequences\nPoor people have less savings and their families and friends are less able to support them and poor countries are less able to provide welfare and other benefits\nThe impact of the crisis was felt acutely in Africa to goes the country was that was the minister financing Nigeria after serving as managing director of the world bank\nWe were struggling with the food crisis that day you had this and the impact I think with three or four kinds ... got no one was fate that private capital flows that was ... at flight to safety that means that they invest us now felt\nVery risk averse than they would drive that money to places they thought they said they had that sense and they can then they'll trade\nAnd trade volume salad dramatically so does developing countries that didn't matter of fact tests on Saturday the house had dropped and plug in out of demand for their products we kept plus rebounded on the economy they had an impact on commodity prices that was another channel\nAnd they ... you know many countries that scale at sporting primary ... so you sell prize is a Monday it's from oil gas to\nAgricultural goods still Metcalfe falling and in fact the price of oil five five recall correctly ... fell dramatically from about the underground fucking four dollars a barrel that about ... dollars within that very short period of time it really ... to launch\nBoil exports is such as Nigeria lose out when prices go down on imports is such a South Africa Tanzania save money\nAnd goes the highlights another impact to the crisis which is that just reduce the opportunities for migrant workers to send money back home\nThese remittances from rich to developing countries amounted to three hundred and fifty six billion dollars in two thousand eight three times greater than aid flows by two thousand nine there were fifty billion dollars lower\nCountries that we make ten states from that people working in developed countries because developed country economy is struggling I'm going into recession of course the jobs that impact tag and people will not send him back\nNormally they may countries average daily in in all kinds of crisis but this time there was an impact\nThat the financial crisis caused immense hardship is indisputable and publishing increased as a result in many countries not at least in Africa\nThe response of governments the crisis mastered enormously\nMassive stimulation package meant that China was relatively immune as well as India which had launched insulation itself from the vagaries of global financial markets [noise]\nThis meant the Asia was least influenced by the crisis in Japan and Korea and as a result it gained enormously economically politically and in terms of confidence\nThat has been rising cultural confidence in Asia India ability to take care of their own societies\nAnd or the global financial crisis gave a set up in a sense almost like an explosive bussed in the cultural self confidence of the ... because they say hey maybe we are doing the right things after all and it's thought the west that we should learn from [noise]\nJoined me in golden here on the b._b._c.

O. two increases is driving the extreme weather and sick and is there something about the way climate change works that does more than merely as jumped the worst whether by increments\nThat second one will take us to the Arctic which could be locking us into patents have drowned them then huge like we've seen this summer the first takes us to the new science of whether the attribution as practiced by climate scientists like Oxford University Freddie also looking for the links between climate change and extreme weather\nWhat education brings is basically it's bringing climate change home where people live because while global mean temperature is a very good measure of climate change it is not what kills you\nHow climate change many tests is through changing extreme weather events and so with that ... we can show\nWhich extreme weather events that people had experience and you can say is climate change really a game changer here and it still by how much but they're also extreme events that are not made more likely\nMean extremes are just part of the climate system they're part of the weather too they happen naturally but they're sometimes is a human induced effect on that and we want to be able to parse out what is natural from what is anthropogenic\nA very extreme and that is unique say you will never be able to say that an event was just caused by climate change I Would have been impossible without climate change how what we can say is how the likelihood of an event occurring is changing the cause of climate change\nEarly player in this exercise is more ... of ... the ... Institute for climate impact research who in twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three still something of a climate models stern\nAnd the scorching Russian ... of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty twenty eleven\nClimate scientists more and more ultimately ... links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing change and extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially heat waves but also after rainfall events\nAre strongly increasing due to climate change and that this was already a mini detectable into observational data we have\nWith just a few years hindsight didn't ... paper seems well timed to five years since I've seen record temperatures above and sing in recent climate history and this year is set to join them\nAlong sciences global highs a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also ought to stick to them as they happen ... outfit will with attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave\nAnd to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years then\nAnd then we ask what would the likelihood of this heat wave occurring be in a well without end to the climate change and then the case of doubling ... it's now we have a climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to protect the climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they meant was made five times more likely to buy into the getting a climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of ... degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that might be to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at like found that if a much much of it right then in the well we live and say I was in the southern model then it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty year then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are\nAll over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher last in this house climate change actually make this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the managing for ... says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses to the comparisons\nThat are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise] so what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like\nPrior to humans producing an effect and we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from will expose so often the finished and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow through the assessment for twenty Seventeen is only now taking shape\nWe won't know what they will make between the Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the followed up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading the extreme looms across Asia one study said would not have been possible without climate change floods in central trying to the Mets are two hundred and fifty seven deaths in twenty two billion dollars of damage\nWe've found to be influenced by global warming\nAre the chances for him to climate fingerprint in flash drowsy in southern Africa in the deadly bleaching of Australia's great Barrier Reef following a prolonged marine see twice\nAnd in a European air pollution crisis that led to vehicle bands in Paris and elsewhere but looking back over the series of reports and oil says system trends standout\nOh temperature no doubt a temperature the increase in the likelihood of daily extremes five daily extreme seasonal extremes\nThat right there is a pretty unequivocal at this point we have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which route so much damage in the ... is just a few weeks back\nWell\nI live\nAround\nThat\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue and me uh culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that the sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nNorth south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it internist dealing with a in more alarming directions\nYou know in one region the jet stream moved north what's it brings warm air holds so topical regions far north Korea it's very warm temperatures region slide Siberia\nAnd at the same time beaches where the jet stream bent self words it brings in the Arctic all the way south ... relatively cold conditions so what's your tend to see if you have to wait for the jet stream you tend to see alternating\nAre normally smuggled him off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand eighty\nAnd the particular version of the ways that most of ... when Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents when are these ... energy become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen wasn't example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at the weather diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out\nAnd that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just one particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing it extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nAround the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed passing the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us in the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils are saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree wave residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if they days and Arctic warming is the drawing in the news from the ... good\nFind it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global is yet to emissions and the Shiites decline in the Arctic at least here in summer but we also see it at all to the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there's a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor in terms of a long term trend at sea ice change in the Arctic\nAnd in our two thousand sixteen paper we competed that for every metric tons of the attitude that added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters at the ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of any relationships and climbed a lot of fun\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate at sea ice loss per increasing C O two\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts MCI conditions from climate models that there'd be conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than what the motives are forecasting so according to our calculations if this linear relationship or to hold\nOver the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September but with more to it often start becoming ice free in August in October and it sort of extending out from there and which here in about Twenty years\nIf this is interesting to me by indeed and he was a policy is that has to be very alarming\nClimate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate won't the world might look like if ... managed to keep average global warming below one point five degrees above pre industrial levels and ambitious and probably impossible target\nWhat we are learning is the worst the weather can throw across can be more dangerous than we did mentioned and that the climate is reorganizing itself to amplify those were ...\nAfter the twenty ninth team will bring our way will not be a topic for another edition of discovery from the
