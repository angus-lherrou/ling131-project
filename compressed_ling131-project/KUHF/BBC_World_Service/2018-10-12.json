hear from you tonight we're focusing on voting who will who won't and who can't\nBecause of new voting rights regulations that make it almost impossible\nWill get into that in a minute but speaking of impossible\nIt may be impossible to imagine\nMore bizarre scene than what occurred today at the White House press corps was brought into the oval office to listen to a ten minute monologue from Kanye West joining me now from the ... from Washington to talk about the event and more consequential news is Washington Post reporter Eugene\nScott Eugene thank you very much for being on America on the line thanks for having me\nSo I Want to start with a serious news and that is\nUm the latest on our colleague Jamal ... is there anything new beyond what our paper the Washington Post reported yesterday in terms of um this being a direct action called by the crown prince\nYeah we're looking at a Congress right now a senator some particular both sides are looking into ways to force a vote that could scrap us arms sales to Saudi Arabia or out of\nFrustration about the disappearance of ... and so we could see some changes happening verified naturally a which is where the Saudi Government has you know been used to being hit most and could lead them to be more forthcoming about what happened\nI'm the president was asked about I'm Jamal ... let's hear what he had to say about the global opinions writer\nThe best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizens is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we don't like it John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars are being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable today\nSo it sounds like we're we're hearing that Congress is is stepping up in trying to be a check on the executive in this regard is anyone talking about the fact that the leader of the free world is not taking a stand on\nFreedom of the press which the United states has always been a beacon of light um when it comes to that in standing up for democracy\nYou do not especially but we should not be surprised considering the track record our president has had when it comes to respecting the press um [noise]\nHe has not been one who has consistently advocated for journalists being able to hold their governments accountable even you know we're dealing with American citizens and as as you saw as you heard in that\nChristina or or or Michael talked about this this interstate cross check system that is the brainchild of Kris Kobach and\nFor listeners who may not know Kris Kobach was um secretary of state of Kansas and who was the one who ... than the now inoperable a voter fraud commission task force that President Trump\nUm impaneled and then disbanded when he came into office\nRight well I think you know what Michael is reminding is is that you know we're still voting without the full protection of the voting rights act\nAnd you know we saw this than twenty sixteen and we're going to see it again and twenty teens so that is a great concern I think\nWhat's going on Indiana and places like Georgia which is really troubling is that you know when we said just a dash is out of place and it can your name is completely annex bunch from the rolls that also disproportionately affects Latino voters who may have hyphenated last name\nSo if that hype and is not there and so there's a gap between the name then that person as it is expunged many people don't know that they're even expunged and so when they do go to vote this type of a discouragement can also turned into a form of voter intimidation which we oftentimes seeing in the south if we remember at brand kept also has a\nCampaign ad with him you know rounding up by truck for him to round up all night\nAnd we quote unquote legal um I don't like the term uh but we've also heard stories from twenty sixteen about people down to the polls armed that will also discourage people so we have some institutional factors as an ex turnout ladies that will disproportionately affects them and let's also remember when Stacey Abrams\nWorked for the non profit news on the worked with a nonprofit the New Georgia project they registered over two hundred thousand Georgians over the past decade or so\nFrank is well aware of that and he he knows that he can't win it outright and says he has to make sure he takes people out of the race because things have us has been traveling the state of Georgia not just Atlanta and that just making into big cities to really make her case not just a black Georgians 'cause they're not enough\nBuilding eligible black Georgian but to poor people middle class people upper class folks all throughout the state and her message is resonating and that is why can't is is really moving forward that this pretty aggressive agenda to explain to people from the girls\nAnd and it's worth noting that Kris Kobach who orchestrated this system called cross tracked where uh it's it's supposedly says oh we think this person might be properly registered and it's full of errors and ... states have pulled out of it because of that\nKris Kobach like camp is running for governor he used both the referee and the player\nAnd co back is\nA notorious as a hobby almost he he went around the country are trying to pass anti immigrant was he's been pedaling the false idea that there's massive widespread voter fraud in the United states and therefore we need to restrict\nThe right to vote in the commission that he orchestrated blew up the ... the White House commission or you the members of the commission began suing each other and it's if it's found no evidence of widespread fraud\nAnd even in his home state of of Kansas there was a lawsuit challenging his purge practices\nAnd the judge ruled against him and ordered him to go back to lawyer school to get remedial legal education because he had so botched this and uh it was quite an extraordinary rebuke of of his entire\nYou had a closet full of objects and he was he instructor whether you ascribe to pick it up to the to the trash can I say or what you're going to show it can I Am sure and that's how I started\nPreserving the legislative to hunt him using that term and extra extra standard friday at ten am on Houston Public media news eighty eight cents [laughter]\n\nI'm Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line a news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations all over the country\nAnd sing with our focus on voter registration we want to welcome to people who've been part of a nationwide effort to register young people it's activism that was born of tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school joining us from Parkland, Florida are ... cofounder of march for our lives\nAnd Ryan beach content creator for march for our lives then leaning Ryan thank you very much for being on America on the line\nI think if I\nSay give 'em ... before I even start this this conversation I Want to thank you for your heart and your activism in everything that you've done\nSince February fourteenth of this year you've done a great thing at such a young age and I was in Washington for march for our lives and had not seen anything like that in my eleven years in the nation's capital\nAnd as everyone knows it was born out of gun violence prevention or was the was the the cause but it's become an even bigger than that what are you working on now what's been the focus\nRyan up well the the the focus so far has has definitely shifted towards as as you know the term election is coming on November sex and we are\nPreparing the young people America as well as everybody else just fruit in this upcoming election really just trying to educate as many people as possible uh we've been registering\nFlorida max calling in to do America on the line\nYeah thanks for having me\nSo if you're registered to vote you're going to vote\nYeah I'm a registered Democrat I'm going to Florida and I go to the proper and I will be voting for general\nAnd and was there and it was there any issue that propelled you the push due to register to vote for was a heavy duty\n[noise] uh I don't think you can boil it down to one is you know there's there's a series of different issues that affect the state of Florida especially young people the the um person bring me to the polls\nAre you focus on the on the gubernatorial race thankfully Dylan versus a government current governor Rick Scott about food\nThe thing that is critically important that we elect go I'm I'm a change the policies that are being propelled by the former minister ration Rick Scott mhm\nYeah and I got that wrong Rick Scott is not running for reelection he's running for Senate and I it's wrong to Sanders who is the Republican the Republican nominee ah my apologies for that max thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nI thank you\nSo the lady and Ryan ... I mean that that's a lot of engagement of of young people that we've just heard from very knowledgeable about\nThe races in their particular states in their communities but as you traveled around the country this summer I'm ... how much apathy did you run into among young people\nI mean the people that we thought too much apathy from the ones that we met with summer coming as these are the people they care enough to to be out there and I think that a lot of them did actually shipped air opinions from one of apathetic on as carrying the ones that we talk to you oftentimes and say\nOh well I didn't really care about letting our politics before that but something about this just drew a connection there and that's why I Do this every day and that's already powerful south\nI assume ten year olds who could talk circles around over half of Congress like\nYoung young people I don't think the issue at this point it's just a matter of making it absolutely important it's easy for them to vote I Know a lot of schools have been putting measures and making it harder for college students to be able to turn in their ballots\nI Know in the state of Florida if you want to turn on that suit T I Believe the secret sure you have to give his I'd have to be identical\nTo your driver's license and I don't have that I don't know many young people who are able to copy their signature almost exactly and my just look rules like that simplified led to April for the younger people of this country to vote then we will have no problem\nLet me go to Luke who is a voting in North Carolina Luke thank you for calling into America on the line thank you for having me so you're you are registered to vote you're going to turn Eighteen just before the midterms\nYes sir I turned Eighteen and nine days\nAnd nine days well happy birthday in advance was there any is there any particular issue that drove you to register to vote to get involved and\nPolitically active so I think there's like a plethora of problems that I'm passionate about um\nFor the primary wanted gun control which hits pretty close to home for me\nMy uncle was at the Las Vegas shooting and saw many of his friends either wind it or died and my fifth grade teacher when I Lived in\nFlorida I'm Scott Segal tragically guy tried to protect his students at Stoneman Douglas I'm so naturally I drove up to DC and attended the march for our lives hoping for some change that housing come to fruition yet\nI'm so dumb controls really important to me in the selection I spoke to the for a candidate though implement some common sense a policy\nLuke thank you thank you very very much for for calling in and I'm I'm Sorry for for your losses there when it come back to Dylan and Ryan Ryan you are the the content creator for march for our lives and in the two minutes that we have left um\nHow are you getting young voters engaged I'm In this voter registration effort and of course this is the leading question to get you to talk

who like sports\nOr who like superheroes or people who like\nCooking shows you're really crippling on to all those other regions because the largest demographic isn't a Democrat or Republican and it's a non boat\nYou know what Ryan we ... we actually have a we actually have a quick clip of the my first time video here it is my first time I was nervous\nMy first time in fact I\nWas in church it was amazing my first time everybody clapped out and finally I just when it\nSnowed [laughter]\nUm when I saw that in the back of the church abide by drugs is just drop but that was that was really

me now from Washington is Derrick Johnson president of the N. double ACP they've launched a new initiative to get black voters to vote and to stay politically engaged particularly African American women and back with me is Fordham political ... political science professor\nChristina Greer welcome to you both to America on the line\nThank you thank you for having me so President Johnson let me start with you and and quote back to you something you wrote in a an opinion piece you wrote in essence magazine that came out yesterday you wrote it is clear that this nation's voting system wasn't built for us\nFor our listeners who who may not know what what this looks like for for black folks can you please explain what you mean what you mean by this\nWith a system of voting in this country was built for aristocratic white males I was not created for full participation of African American and that fact for white women\nAfter American men have the right to vote for white women had the right to vote although there were aggressive efforts to suppress to write\nA to exercise a vote by after America's particularly in the south so the system was not built for us to participate\nBe feeding of of the energy of African American women's but understanding that this one election cycle is not enough it was a five year trajectory that we're on to make sure we sustained movement but more importantly mid term election is the low water mark for voting presidential election as a high watermark\nAnd that as a result of a a heavy concentration of ad by campaigns I use it now that you that presidential elections like a Coca Cola size or add budget by\nI I'm a mid term elections like RC Cola and by your reminded constantly doing president's election so more people go to vote but the mid term elections you don't hear about it as often\nAs you were there for you have a lower voter turnout and so our goal is to do supplement that lack of information understanding unimportant by talking to infrequent voters those individuals who voted on presidential elections\nBut don't folks do a midterm election and using people in the community to go and courage in holding hands and continue to remind them of the important of the vote\nI also I'm reminded of say the work of higher heights because not only are they trying to get women to come out to vote there also inspiring and supporting financially and other ways black\nWomen to actually run for office and so in doing this multi step process you have black women\nAs voters if black women as donors and you also have black women as candidates so that three pronged approach actually has been increasing black female participation on a host of levels because now you have people who were invested\nEmotionally mentally and also financially in the wellbeing of particular black women from across the country and so as they build this fifty state network\nFrom not just women like Stacey Abrams running for governor of Georgia\nBut we are talking about ... in Illinois ran for Congress but also people who are running in lower levels um that are part of this larger network in higher heights I think that's also a sustaining approach to make sure that black women are involved in a year round\nPolitical process you know the postage is every two to four years\nSo when Valerie Jarrett was here the former senior advisor to President Obama and she's on the board\nOf I'm I'm Michelle Obama's group when we all when we all vote the whole purpose is to get people to vote not just in the big elections but in the little like a little election it how do you know that's where the sounds of both of you how do you convince people who\nDon't have a tradition of voting that voting for literally dog catcher school board\nJudges um ... is is important\nI Do this with my students all the time and I said this really briefly when people were watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearing and there were so outraged by\nCertain senators and their behavior and also the age dynamic where we saw many of our elected leaders\nAre were well above Seventy years old I reminded them that so many of them got their start in state houses which then turned into than being members of the house which then turned into than being senators and so these individuals have been in the political process\nSort of in these competitive or sometimes not even not even competitive primary but definitely the vast majority are not even in competitive general election races so there is centrally walking into a D.C\nEvery two four six years depending on on what officer holding and so it is important for them to invest early\nIn elected officials on the state house level keep in mind Shirley Chisholm from New York state got her start in Albany before she became the first black woman\nTo represent New York state in Congress and so it local politics matters and so for a our previous caller is very important to not just vote in mid term and presidential year elections but if you are in a place like New York city you have to vote in municipal elections as well go ahead\nYou know the the question was how do we get low propensity or infrequent voters to vote civil was there was talk to them\nCommunicate with them the magical Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nIs not the result of her win a primary this year the magic is she started four years five years ago matter of fact and she started talking to people getting the ... vote\nBuilding a report communicate with them build a lot of infrastructure and talking to them the magic of Andrew Gillum is not the fact that he was married just before he ran for governor it was the fact that he and share Letterman built an infrastructure talk to people\nDay in and day out and and ... it in a way in which folks felt empowered to say okay I don't know about the voting thing but I Know her because she listens to me she talked to me but most importantly if we look at the history of African American voting\nWe hit a low point in terms of growth than twenty six team right because we want to twenty\nTwo thousand eight we didn't know how we won because it was based on emotion ... and we don't have the President Johnson I'm going to have to do our goes in\nFifteen seconds we're going to be off the air Christina Greer president Derrick Johnson of the N. double ACP

panic buying things are going to watch is not going to show photo ID to vote you know it\nSort of what's going wrong here\nAnd people do choose to food to food because\nIt's almost a year since Robert Mugabe was kicked out of town in Zimbabwe the politicians who replaced and insist they are now taking steps to fix a broken economy that means new taxes and it means new rules for ... local

another ... suspicious and\nDifferent nearly a trillion dollars and I've got three tens of things and some some office to show\nThat was me in a local supermarket a decade ago when hyperinflation

legitimacy as I'm listening to you the symbol of shows that it is an easy vocal part to democratization to reform this is a basket case\nBut it's not too far yes the country's heavily in debt but the economist national Chuck with us he believes the current panic over inflation is being overblown\nThere has to be an adjustment because we have been living beyond our means as a country how big a whole is involved when\nWhen it's a pretty big oil I mean we've been going in this election for the last two years of mismanagement but the measures that are being taken now out in the right direction and I think we need to get used to the idea that we are going to have difficult at times\nBut um you know just as much as we've gone down so far the turn it on can be quite quick also government should do to leave and I think that they should be given an opportunity to actually show what they can do\nIn the meantime I've joined a cue of cars about a mile long waiting for ... here in Harare the mood\nYou remember the last time there was heightened fashion food shortages to them and an eight times coming back\nMaybe what did you feel optimistic when President Mugabe power on new team came oh really [noise]\nYou've ever met my trees\nReports but under hunting [noise]\nNow what questions are being asked about how in American run charge you set up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them wants to be abused instead\nThe more than me educational chance she responded by an American living Katie ... who have millions of dollars and was even granted a building by the then president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf like thank you for seeing how they have a number of golf had come forward and edging they had been raped by the organizations may coordinate can't Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and let the died of aids but the fact that the charge you will still able to operate to raise more funds just by the scandal and good people in Liberia\nOne man who took up the story you know your long investigation is really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro republic ProPublica on time or does it\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier\nIt was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often managing scholarship program last time went on the organization was through the the marketing ability you have to find their kicked him either\nWas able to win the million dollars in a competition through Facebook which then meant that they could open up good on school but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements the police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that\nThey were as young as ten when the rapes began\nOn ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson how did the investigation unfold will basically this was an organization that has had some rumors\nIt was known in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape but are really no one has ever gone deep and to\nReally find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about that is that the organization right after this happened there was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were and its care or so when the ... came to light\nThe organization essentially said and this was in their press statement\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... station had an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him by giving him the power to educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light you had been reaping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating cultures in a challenge in context may have contributed\nTo his ability to access to abused young girl\nDemand ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended and how would you do and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually affected as well\nThe challenge with the story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the time and girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by them die that tested positive and we also know that one of the pen victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate generally there'll be unity changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements of the police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time and\nThe organizations founder and the organization overall we're courted very strongly by international press subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months that these rapes and our organization coming to like a\nJournalist Finley young ... called ... how's this treatment in June of ...\nBills named John some of the abuse of both of the kinds of me on to the community as soon as the fossil fuels reported costs the new stuff we acted swiftly on decisively with corporations with the Liberian national police or the ministry of justice to collect evidence to good jumps and sent to jail\nIf each needs down to ... take a look at the main headlines cat at the BBC a costing tax he's expected to consider the fleeing a U.S pasta detained for two years\n... officials ... recordings that support they have a session at a ... mission in Istanbul and wildlife his name in bats have nearly doubled in Fifteen Years\nAnd Mr Bush famously changed and legions from the national policy to the African National Congress in two thousand and

U. H. F. Houston and kale HDTV eight point six used in a service of the University of Houston\nMaybe see well ... ... with the real story one topic one hour every week\nAnd this week we knew this climate change but what about the political changes that are needed to tackle rising temperatures according to the un report heat waves droughts and floods could be the future is a much of the world if we can't keep the temperature rise to one point five degrees Celsius\nBut we prepared to make dramatic changes to the way we live for the sake of the planet well the public agreed to pay for the switch from producing fossil fuels to clean renewables that's the thought is that it used to a ... of growth and prosperity they willing to give up causing meet for the good of the F\nWill rapidly growing economies except to break on rising living standards to tackle climate change and do the Democratic politicians have the will and the incentive to jump in such a tough policy agenda that's the real story from the BBC coming up off to the news\n\nAnd I'm David ... with the b._b._c. news the president of South Korea has told the BBC that it is only a matter of time before Washington and Pyongyang declared an end to that stage of war on the Korean Peninsula low Rebecca reports from so\nPresident admitted that he feels more than anyone the pain of war and separation his parents like North Korea and Nineteen fifty three and they never sell their family again he had he became president a factory at the help prevent more returning to the peninsula\nFighting ended in Nineteen fifty the with an ... that never peace treaty mangy and in fact the meetings with Kim Jong un this year with the aim of persuading him to end his nuclear program\nHe had ... young has a clear vision for the north and have proven to be candid he said the north Korean leader had promised to relinquish has left in the United states ... case\nA course in Turkey yesterday due to resume hearing the case of the American pastime Andrew Brunson who's been detained in Turkey for two years the U.S State Department has dismissed local ... media reports that American and Turkish officials have struck a secret deal to release the pasta from Istanbul McClellan\nIn October twenty sixteen Andrew Brunson Christian mission ran turkey for twenty three years was detained this possible ... off to the failed coup\nHis charges include supporting terrorists the alleged coup ... Kurdish militants which he asked his governments say a faceless\nAccusing turkey of holding the pastas leverage Donald Trump recently lost patience Washington imposing sanctions on two Turkish ministers at hiking terrorists some Turkish goods\nUs media reports say the Turkish government has audio and video recordings that they say prove the missing Saudi journalist ... ... was killed inside the Saturday comes she lives in Istanbul when he disappeared ten days ago\nThe U.S and Turkish officials are reported is saying that the recordings provide graphic evidence that the Saudis security team detained and killed Mr ...\nSays the Arabian has denied all involvement in the disappearance\nThe ... the Indonesian President Joe co widowed ... has warned of a gathering of a global bankers and finance ministers in body that escalating trade tensions could mean that winter is coming this would do to emphasize that there was a needs to remain vigilant as charisma this funny reports\nAnd climate breaks generally because what we're talking about is we're talking about averting a terrible catastrophe so I think an investment is exactly the way to think about it\nAnd I think we also have to be very realistic about the kinds of things we're trying to preserve for trying to preserve safe human existence on the planet we're trying to preserve the lives in chances of among the most vulnerable people as well because the most vulnerable populations those are already poor\nOr or elderly or have more difficult circumstances will be the most affected the first affected so I think that that has to be your absolute priority and from that perspective economic cost is necessary it's not that it's it's just an an absolutely necessary investment\nNow of course they're all going to have to be very very big changes and we're hopefully going to talk about this quite a bit\nUm including the fact that we're talking about energy rejections so not just energy efficiency that reduction in total levels of energy demand especially in the interim because we've really left the problem too too late we've really been delayed\nBy all kinds of problems um such as a climate denial us and influences of big fossil lobbies so\nBut we usually about reduction of ... of of energy use you're talking about people getting out of that cause and walking all cycling or using public ... for\nAn absolutely absolutely and so especially in the injury and we are talking about reducing our energy use considerably\nUm however uh the research shows in my research and particularly I'm as well as others that energy consumption does not necessarily mean living standards so it is possible to have a perfectly good quality of life\nAnd have lower energy use but the infrastructure has to be there at the infrastructure has to be in place such as public transit ... cities that are safe to cycle and walk in that era\nLordy as an adult do you think that people living in cities as they do now especially in the developed world going to see it quite as positive as\nWell in fact what we know is that people in cities have generally lower carbon footprint\nWhen compared to people who don't even see the if I\nThink just in my experience coming from Cambridge this morning I was biking behind Abbas and there was black smoke coming out of the bus I think that in you know it's easy to see particularly on these ethical benefits from changing most of transportation what some of the state today benefits are from reducing things like oil consumption\nBut tons of ordinary people and you if you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that call and trying to use public transport it's a tough off\nCertainly I think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of top down leadership in terms of what\nLeaders of the city level that the regional level and at the national level do and we also need to my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these benefits of changing the way in which we work but I think you're right that the notion that\nFrom one day to the other we're going to get people in London to completely change the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because actually they release in ... the public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as jewelry and ah and Julia mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that these hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with these balls top down and bought him up\nMolly still Kay says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to the Christmas\nI really don't agree I mean I think of getting people to get us a Cohen still sitting in a traffic jam is that she could and appealing a skinny if lots of people go to the ... and we're on the bus it wouldn't be the traffic down so everybody get to a post a suit you know the private ... such a freedom all happiness and if you sit on the bus then you go look for people to ... way struggle\nBut that's the reason that there are plenty of people who do see that individual is being in the car or something they value very honestly\nI think a lot of people actually enjoy public transport when it works well if we think about young people never looked at them and choosing not to drive particularly if they live in cities where the public transport is good so it's it I think is the others have said it's more important that you have good public transport\nSo you give people are real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoys the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and he said the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they would we can change systems have mobile home working people working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis as well as an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nMobile this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example think about aviation people loved flying gig on holidays about traveling for all kinds of reasons how on us would something like aviation fish in to a much greener well\nWell the new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September I think lays out aware of this restructuring the global economy and the way that allows us great for freedom and greater opportunity for a a more sustainable growth model\nBut we have for a moment about there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems so cold hard to it by sectors including things like shipping aviation\nSome forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on there\nAnd they were crossing our fingers and this and ...\n... people were working on this all across the world a new development going on there's a report you out of the end of November Bobby energy transition commission\nWhich will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development of battery technology is not happening so quickly there is support specter of short flights being possible using ... technology support same with law a long distance trucking Jones\nEasy now slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to end you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every mega Jewell is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNo everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five ... is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of managing the climate and if\nPeople saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the ... fall we just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard folk it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in the life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better call legalized say don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these in the ... they say we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term\nQuip I'm coffee I'll give you some examples we know that\nThe increasing an extra see the price I think that you cannot another country and in other countries have hurt the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot\nSay that there are no Lewis says what we can say that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short term\n... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think is an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I looked\nAn urgent approach to climate change\nAnd I think I Would really go attention feel do sustainable finance we've all good investments whether that's in pension funds of savings and at the moment those are often invested in total destruction of technologies and it's a choice to shift those and in fact just politicians now we're framing a process whereby\nEverybody will have to move their money out so fossil fuels and tools a sustainable future instead so there's a lot of power we have politically over the economy and we need to use that to shift probably just investment\nGiven given the kind of levels of of votes that policies like you'll get do you think there is public awareness public support for those kind of policies\nWill in terms of sustainable finance I went to another report here in the parliament and it was supposed to cross you know really took us to the right wing\nOf the the people who were elected but I didn't think this is an issue that's not exclusively to the ownership of one party all politicians are focused on this and that's how I managed to build a strong ... really to support an important and powerful position on sustainable finance\nSo let's try and understand the ... for a moment before we returned to the politics when we look at renewables are we working towards having enough renewables to power our ... our needs by themselves billboard\nWell in the u._k. for instance we are making a very big switch\nTo a low carbon forms of power generation particularly drive in coal off the system\nSo what's happened since Ninety nine to use the u._k. has managed to reduce its annual emissions of greenhouse gases by more than forty percent of its economy is growing by more than Seventy percent so it has demonstrated that tackling climate change does not mean you have to sacrifice economic growth it hard with a relatively modest\nCarbon price and wise investments in the development of renewables managed to drive coal almost completely out of its power generation system is set itself I\nConservatives talk you've I think of getting cold down to zero by twenty twenty five or does mean investments out front but in many places the price of renewables per unit was just being coming down far quicker even but most economists held on to survive and then in many parts of the world it is now cheaper\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar reform cheaper than relying on coal or gas or the other folks of Judea San\nDiego lots of good news that renewables are going up but all day reliable enough at least their place the nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to touch we need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news however they've not been driving hospitals shows off the grid\nAnd and the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much but just this week the government has given the go ahead to drill for fracking at the press to new roadside which was very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government forced them to accept fracking on their location so very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just on developing renewables and driving their price down\nAnd incentivizing renewable production but we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development and the other two separate efforts why I don't think that we can count on sheep renewables it's too much to ask of cheap renewables to drive felt fulfilled off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking a little lower and another another level and Laura deals\nOn it and we were in Norway last week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all of this was off the back of the sales of ah oil and increasing the gas\nWell I think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and they the the the one thing I report talked about energy talks about land use talks about CDs and talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables themselves kind of do everything it's of course easier to make these investments if there's a lot of surplus however I must say that Norway is actually more some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to sink\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources um happening doing it um I think um\nWe need to you know you you mentioned um retail at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that one point five it's perfectly too old I Would like to kind of real\nHealthy to all I was just a ... there's an optimism that they also bold\nEnough of them but I think is really important to know that he's extremely hard that we need all options that we need action from all sectors we need to finance community we need a policy community at all levels are ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need everything and I think that\nAn enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics and the movement but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between a ...\nYeah I mean there were so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he's had a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or a four different policies\nMulti I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nWill the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five ... ... when the twin daughters and make it was ... I\nThink the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify energy supply and make it a little coping as quickly as fulfilling the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on a no the more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's hit from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the Trump transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's IPC the report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects\nOn the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is in slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they are claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that decides if could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this little stairs [noise]\nAh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's as in David say they got nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this the last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually used the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have the view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that is true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI unimportant me when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states has been long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other forces such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nSome of these challenges with us and I think ah well this is because democracies are very good benefits today costs in the future and in fact here we have a lot of costs today and kind of more feature benefits but I think we can highlight in particular policy actions that the local level that the region level at the national level\nFrom the perspective of these benefits that we will have today or in the short term and we talked about some of these health benefits there are some of the call benefits that we can talk about some of them might be health so much ... ... jobs\nAnd let me bring joy that back in the streets are we talking about benefits in the future\nIn developed countries people don't like having stuff taken away from them they don't want to know that they don't want to hear that they can't buy more clothes or and you call in a country like India where people are aspiring to these things are responding to the refrigerator they moved to bike and perhaps the call Alan us do you persuade them to say you know will you don't want that stuff\nBasically people going to have a good life but they don't necessarily want to have throwaways things that you throw away every day so if you just take the case of plastics them onto plastics me throw we consume huge amounts of muscles feels as well as energy\nSo the question is how do we use the existing culture in different countries in the world to try to focus more on quality rather than quantity so it's not as if you want to really say that you should buy less but why can't you buy better quality\nVery poor person in the air is that even really an option\nNo but the foot up less than he has the right of course to improve his life all her life\nAnd I think the question is much more about the rich the question of inequality was brought up we know that you know one percent of the world's population seems to have as much as the remaining Ninety nine percent and that's also true for India do you need much more equality within the Indian society as well and more sharing of the wealth\nI went to a feature view of a final question I'll begin with you you're in ten years time if we're going to follow those ah recommendations and the reporter the findings of the report we would need to be well on our way to reduce ... emissions so do you believe given what we know now about a\n... on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nThrough this report says read off for by the governments are novel feeding to political pro says up to the end of the year and over the coming years governments who have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table\nSo I really do hope that governments take into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on the tractor worth reducing global emissions Laura\nIn tiny as time I think if we have countries that put in place you know the politically Bible second best policies to create coalitions of winners that reduce the costs to search that invest in innovation at that emphasized fickle benefits maybe [laughter]\nBut I was I don't think we have any choice but to believe we can because we'll tons of it is we just gave up and then it's old do\nSo on one doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it more people have to engage with politicians and said to them we want to see the future we have because there's a future not just for the people here and now\nIt's a condor well we want to leave to our children and grandchildren I think most people want the will to be a better place for their children or grandchildren they currently have\nJoined the group the court cases in India and in the U.S by young children are asking that governments there doing enough\nSo I think that when you see a whole sees all four cases where people who've tried to put pressure on the government's been need much more leadership policy entrepreneurs and social movements to get this going and we desperately need the help of the gym and it's\n... I Would agree\nTo that and I think we can't wait for ten years I think that every decision we make and every anybody who's listening to this try to think about how you can form a neighborhood group to talk to your friends your neighbors making meeting with your local and he\nWe need to get moving every single decision we make every single hour we spend every single piece of information we can bring into schools and bring up for debate\nThis is something that's going to take all of us and it's going to take all the effort we have to keep the number of to be honest dead people as low as\nPossible and ... well I think\nI Am bringing good news really from Brussels because we need to do more we've made very strong progress in terms of industry and an energy systems when I was working on a sustainable finance agenda to stove or the unsustainable sectors and especially for for ... over\nThe finance that they need and I think the ... that we haven't talked about very much which is absolutely crucial is changing the way we eat so that we're reaching let's meet andme approaching groups and changing the way we phone so that we use the land is a natural carbon sink and also bump will treason and have agro forestry system so it's all under way I think there is a lot of hope\nThat's great too low not no\n... says joy to go to your ear a gal Laura Diaz on it on board and do this time but thank you all that's it for this week on the real story\nIf you'd like to listen to the program again or any other from the ... you can listen back on line by such info BBC the real story and if you like this week probably going to make sure you never miss another edition and subscribed to uphold cost you can find a simply by searching for the real story in your poll cost up\nAnd we love to hear your thoughts email is the real story at BBC don't Kendall UK for me with last shot on the team is the real story for this week I was listening\nIn big name said music TV film and the major loan\nTo depression undiscovered Alan ... is our we've mainly keeping the beaches in to be from what I mean everything to me\nAnd I didn't know I used in public media news [noise]\nGood morning to you I'm Stephen K and this is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven K.

girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victim so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the

they affect women and men who is that the world and they rise with economic development\nHere's the thing the women were about to hear from will say the stereotype that eating disorders or rich white west and women's problem still widely prevails\nDealt all say tell me that when eating disorders in that community have already knowledge\nThe blame is often placed on west and I ...\nIn particular that the siege of West and beauty ideals and that to them doesn't always mean tree [noise]\n... is twenty six year old ... in South Africa histories thoughts five years ago but not with a desire to be thin\n[noise] um [noise] so I mean there was some traumas that um I had\nBeen through um\nJust violations um you know against my buddy as a woman um that was a very confusing time um I\nDidn't speak out about it that's the point to my life and so you know I guess as a result of that I\nJust went into this depression it was a lot that I did not understand or even know about depression or even an eating disorder those were foreign um foreign subjects something that you know a stereotypically why people went through\n... can you explain your feelings about food at that time\nThe word I use is it repulsed me\nThe smell of food would make me really sick it would make me ashes actually you know you're taught that it's a if you're visiting someone's house and uh you did not finish your food you being rude\nSo that was something that was super super hot for me to deal with because of the harsh criticism or teasing that I Would get because I haven't touched my food so I guess it's abnormal for a blockbuster and to not want to eat well it's not like food\nUm it was a very strange thing for people to see\nWas any of this about your boss he waits with any of this about wanting to be saying\nThere was never a point where I wanted to be you know a skinny or an ideal body type there was never a point where um you know flipping through a magazine and saying oh I Want to be that size or I Want that buddy I've always been comfortable with my buddy I'm my buddy\nIt is a self image issues only came about after I lost all the way it's because I felt that I looked horrible or couldn't\nQuite handle the comments I'm ... and buddy shaming comments that were being pasta but how skinny hours or how unhealthy I was looking I didn't see my family for very long time you know there's just a grand sense of shame that comes with that as well\nYou know my mum would ask me what is wrong and I could never explain it as a result I just felt to keep to myself how did you ever met anyone with an eating disorder\n[noise] no I never\nHad you ever had of about South Africa with an eating disorder never\nHow different she think things would have been for you if that was more awareness about eating disorders in South Africa and particularly about black women having eating disorders\nIf I had known you know to see think this would existed\nThen I Would have been able to get help\nIt wasn't until he went to see a therapist that she realized ... illness was an eating disorder she told me having a name for it gave her a huge sense of relief and with the support a family and friends she began to recover\nBut she says she didn't continue to see a therapist an older white women\nThere's a lot of complexity to being black and of course a lot of complexity to being watched as well but the experiences because of the history of this country of segregation of about the age\nOf separate development it means that the two realities of distinctly different so a problem that I might pose to an older white women from another generation\nShe is not open to all the possibility of a little while the reality of mine lived experience they will give me watch solutions for my block problems\nWill which good treatment of looked like what did you need to do you think\nUm I definitely think if I had spoken to a black female therapist she would have been more helpful to my um situation\nCould you found a\nFemale therapist or I think they do exist yet but they ought to come by\n[noise]\nHow hot they [noise] I did find that chemical psychologist who specializes in eating disorders but cycled into feeling it might be hard to find many more [noise]\nYou know if there are many black psychologists specialize in eating disorders across South Africa\n[noise] unless they are not really I don't I don't I don't have a good sense of how many they would be out there and there's quite a few chat rooms where we've having us less anyone else\nWell India in [laughter] new one Indian psychologists have you ever met any other psychologists have a specializing in eating disorders and send them to\nKnow do you think it's important that black South Africans with eating disorders can speak to black psychologists\n[noise] what do we know about therapies that if a good relationship can be established any any person took took him to anyone from any race you know confined there'd be beneficial but you do find patients often asking for same race therapists\nAnd then they hold on us on a wet suit to public psychiatric hospital in Johannesburg which has the only state funded inpatient each ... unit in South Africa\nShe told me that was the first cases of eating disorders amongst black South African women were documented in the Nineteen nineties that hasn't seen enough for that since then ship it figures on the scale of the problem although\nThere's definitely a sense um that it it is increasing the exposure to if the culture is something that seems to influence the likelihood of one developing an eating disorder\nWe see me especially in the younger population who live in the ... it's an area is going to make schools that are linked to associated eating disorders thinking so a lot of concern around race in shape losing weight\nIs visiting the pro anorexic open to make with sides so that waste and culture influence is seeming to to be one of the big contributions and the prevalence of eating disorders and blood in the black population\nThe teaching disorders on just about being saying all by some of the people respect and to on this program has been really came to emphasize that that is not well trained and everything to soda\nYeah so it's not just about being send different elements a lot of patients will talk about different things that are on trying to control what feels ... like a very chaotic outside world\nBeing able to live independently without other relationships because people disappoint you and hurt you so that's different sort of narrative behind what away the eating disorder might have stemmed from but I think different if he the pro sin pro\nUm fitness kind of message that's communicated can tend to exist debate\nThose already existing problems so I think that's the one factor that has been researched unfortunately there's not a lot of resurgence of Africa and eating disorders [noise]\nI mean I had some of my family ... found out I was growing up and they can stay with my sister\nShe can front of me\nRather than talk about my eating disorder I started talking about my childhood rape\nLike that was less provocative and upsetting and and unless I was that made me feel less vulnerable than talking about my eating disorder\nYou know I always I always heard things like well you know black women don't have eating disorders black women are incredibly comfortable with with being large black women or you know so I just felt like I was failing all the way around failing at ... at being the archetype strong black woman [noise]\nSay Stephanie suffered inside and\nUntil one day on the New York subway she spotted an ad in the ...\nAnd it said it if you have an eating disorder we can help you and I just remember clutching onto this magazine and thinking this has to be the answer [noise]\nAnd so I went to this guinea pig program was at one of the hot larger hospitals and I felt like a freak people were just staring at me and [noise]\nYou know because what I've since learned is that women of color don't tend to come forward and you know it just didn't work I felt it was another experience where I just felt isolated I felt like the only black woman in the world who didn't know how to eat\nEventually Stephanie found support program which ... but she says accepting help didn't come easily\nI come from a very proud very proud community who like to keep our secrets and our issues to ourselves\nIt's it's like you don't share what's happening in your household with the outside world and and you certainly don't share it with white people you know that's kind of a betrayal and so you learn how to cope on your own\nI always say why are we one of the only communities that have to struggle in silence that have to\nYou know suffer as if it's some badge of courage\nWhat does this attitude to mental health come from do you think\nIt's just like a holdover from slavery it's like you're going to go out into the world and trust\nWhite people you know when you look at these these people of color who have trusted the system\nAnd and been burnt I think it's well deserved this lack of trust she thinks the eastern food is still seen as a white women's problem what do you think sections have changed eating\nDisorders are seen as a white women's problem they're seen as a gateway to wanting to be white they're seen as black women who want to be mainstream or who want to be skinny they're not seen as a mental health issue they're not seen\nAs a coping mechanism and I thought if I wrote a book and helped one person understand all people men and women who deal with stress\nMay develop an unhealthy relationship with food so I wrote my book the response was not what I expected when I found in ... was it was\nA lesbian women why poor women all kinds of ethnic women but it took a while for the black community to kind of embrace me in the same way\nI'm One of those that do you think\nKnow it's it's a shameful thing we don't want to talk about the molester uncle\nThey don't want to talk about things in our community that don't bring us pride like we still have one or two or three black women speaking for the entire community and that is problematical except somebody has to speak why they're so few women speaking\nI mean it's certainly not sexy right like like like yeah I Want to talk about throwing up like ... you know you kinda lose all your oh you're black girl magic when that's where your your conversation it's just less than ... people are less interested\n[noise]\n[noise] we should be listening to the piano ... Stephanie it's clear that to the eating disorders is a problem that time the effects white women in western countries can prevent the women and men who suffer from these potentially fatal illnesses from finding the support they need\nIf you've seen affected by issues in the program does he tell website WWW dot ... feet don't\nSee I don't you pay for what ... the chain and you'll find some links students ... support [noise] and that's just not what you think about this week's program on social media using the hash tag BBC the chain somehow for me anytime is\nAn editor ... thanks than his name and join us\nAgain for the food chain next week\nBy\nOn Christmas really from life of heroin Chris do and\nWe're proud to be the highest rated to our live musical comedy variety show on public radio in this time for\nIt in this weekend for our showed powers leader in Saint Paul Minnesota with the ... brothers this Madison Cunningham\nAnd dirty projector fly from here we make great radio\nThat fly from here Saturday at five pm on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven [noise]\nGood morning to you thanks for joining us here on your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven K. U. H. F. Houston KU HGTV eight point six used in a service of the University of Houston\nI'm Stephen K with your National Weather service for cast includes mostly sunny skies for friday height new in the low eighties will have partly cloudy skies a friday night with a low in the mid the high seventies slight chance we'll see some rain over the weekend but temps will remain consistent it's currently sixty\nComing up off the news on the b._b._c. World Service it's hard to quit me Stephen factor\nThe Saudi journalist Jamal ... disappeared off the train was founded comes you look in Istanbul last week or mineral wealth or speculation of lurid allegations a cloud of suspicion now hangs over the Saudi Government\nTo put it bluntly the wreck or the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman the kingdom's that fact to ruler suggests a ruthless determination to silence criticism\nMy guests today are Saudi academic my that we all Rashid and former senior U.S diplomat Nicholas Burns\nAs an activist as an academic who has written a lot of books that offer a different narrative from the official shouted propaganda I Would never set foot in the Saudi embassy even when I wanted my passport to be renewed that's not that we all Rashid all talk after the news\nOn Justin Greenwood the b._b._c. news the president of South Korea was told the BBC that it's only a matter of time before Washington and Pyongyang declared an end to the state of war on the Korean Peninsula or the moon Jae in admitted that could be more diplomatic bumps and bruises along the way there were ... and so\nThey came out in the middle here to try to mediate between at the U.S and North Korea has been at president named Jan\nAnd he has had three summit with Kim Jong and this year and he says that Kim Jong un is connected to complete\nDenuclearization and that he understands that that means dismantling his current nuclear arsenal bought president made ... said that he hadn't talked about how that process would wet in detail or look a timetable that he hoped that would be looked at at the next United States North Korean summit which could be quite saying\nQuote in Turkey has resumed hearing the case of the American Palestine Andrew Brunson he's been detained in Turkey for two years on charges of supporting terrorism from Istanbul mountain loving\nIn October twenty sixteen Andrew Brunson a Christian mystery in Turkey for twenty three years was detained this positive ... off the failed coup\nHis charges include supporting terrorists the alleged coup autism Kurdish militants which he and his government say a faceless\nAccusing turkey of holding the pastas leverage Donald Trump recently lost patience Washington imposing sanctions on two Turkish ministers hiking terrorists some Turkish goods\nMount Lemmon reporting us media reports say the Turkish government have audio and video recordings they say prove that the missing Saudi journalist Jamal ... was killed inside the Saudi consulate in his stumble when he disappeared ten days ago\nUs tech U.S officials have reported is saying that the recording show that the Saudi security team kill them and just men but his ability Riyadh has denied involvement in his disappearance\nThe former South African foreign minister ... has died in Pretoria at the age of Eighteen six it's both her was one of the most recognizable faces of the apartheid era government during if he is an international isolation ... reports from Johannesburg\nBoth I was at one stage the longest serving foreign minister in the world he became foreign affairs minister in Nineteen Seventy seven\nWell he had been inside the Saudi Government as you mentioned Steven hum at times he obviously had turned against the Saudi Government was quite critical of the Saudi Government that's why I had to position himself\nInside the United states obviously the Saudis are always focused on their relationship with the United states is the most important relationship they have\nWe're not allies but we're very strong security partners and the Saudis care about what the United States thinks the Washington Post has is even in a more influential paper in recent years there has been the past\nAnd so the Saudis obviously bristle I'm at any criticism and that's been the hallmark of Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince the outrageous\nA house arrest of the prime minister of Lebanon by the Saudi crown prince the outrageous house arrest us Saudi princes\nThe temperate criticism of the Canadian government the jailing of female activists he has shown very clearly that he does not Brooke any criticism inside or in this case perhaps outside of Saudi Arabia\nHow far does this determination of the Saudi Government to suppress dissent go I'm just thinking of particular case is one of\nThe leading Saudi a women's rights activists are Lou Gino how to lose who was picked up on the streets of U. A. E. and transported in handcuffs to Saudi Arabia by Saudi officials\nWe've had reports of Canadian blogger whose Youtube videos were critical of Saudi Arabia seeing that his family members including brothers back home in Saudi Arabia were in prison how determined from your experience all the Saudis to reach dissent wherever it might be\nYes absolutely this is a new phase and that had been found to exercise and asylum seekers and opposition figures in London since the Nineteen nineties but we we are entering a new phase where I'm at ten men is determined to show that he could reach everybody outside the borders of Saudi Arabia\nLeave you personally fearful in a way that you weren't perhaps ten years ago\nYes yes because in the past people who had critical opinions wet tolerate it in some ways and\nAs long as they done mobilize people inside Saudi Arabia or if you criticize the government you are ignored and if you're outside but as long as you do not call on people to act on this grievances whether they are the detention of human rights activist lawyers intellectuals and academic you left alone\nAnd I and of course there is over with now with social media threats I mean every day a lot that's how the opposition figures and even academics like myself we received threats on Twitter that\nOh Mohammed bin Salman can get you wherever you are okay this is social media nobody knows where it's coming from but we do take notice of that\nJust want to take a step backwards for a moment because it is important to remember that just Eighteen months ago the world was so excited about this man Mohammed bin ... thirty two years old\nIn effect put in charge of the the world's most oil rich king Dimock key strategic player in the middle east and he came to power pledging reforms saying he was going to\nBe a dynamic reformer of the Saudi economy he was going to moderate\nThe ... be religious or control of the of the nation to to change Saudi Arabia is sort of religious leanings and he was going to free up the society free up women to drive open up cinemas modernize the entire kingdom and he wants\nIt's the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had\nAnd so you've seen the substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steve and I think that there is growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be an entirely reckless inhumane\nBeef steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that\nWith the the problem with the Saudis have cause any ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen with American weapons I think in the United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nI at the Saudis can't develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr could show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAn interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and virtually any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... balls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether\nYour belief that the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia\nIs really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nThe allegations of serious the paper said the president and his family had in all likelihood short changed the government of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes in some cases via outright fraud\nIn a moment we'll speak to the reporter who spent Eighteen months researching the story a story President Trump's lawyer has cooled both and defamatory\nBut first in another age an investigation like this had the power to bring down a politician even a whole government on Twitter President Trump himself but he gave it his attention that was just a single tweet and what she called it\nQuote boring but what about American voters his view from a town in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump San Antonio in Texas\nNew York times is regularly putting out I think incorrect information so my first inclination is to just not\nAnything I say and you think that's like an opinion that a lot of friends neighbors amateur yesterday one of the allegation straight up and\nThen I Would want to look into it and I'd reconsider and you know maybe changed my mind that so far the New York times has been zero for zero I already had a very low opinion\nOf Trump and\nStill have a low opinion of Trump in the article I feel like he he like he can do\nWhatever he wants and articles don't matter it wouldn't change my opinion if someone's on the fence about Trump at this point I'm not sure that this investigation and changing anything there's probably enough information out there for you to make up your mind one way or the other\nSo nah nope all that does then Craig is one of the New York times journalist who spent the last year and a half of their lives delving into the details of President Trump and his family's tax if as to how much would she put into it\nWhen was it now it was march of two thousand and Seventeen Eighteen months ago and Rachel Maddow who has a talk show in the United states she had three pages of Donald Trump's two thousand and five tax returns\nAnd what was striking to us was that he had actually made a hundred and thirty odd million dollars in two thousand five we were just shocked and so the next morning started this odyssey of digging into his finances\nThat ended up with the story that we ran\nAnd it's an incredibly detailed story fourteen thousand would article was it difficult to take that deep I mean how was it hard to get the feuds get the documents you needed\nIt was like having a million puzzle pieces thrown into the middle of the times square and being asked to put them back together we started out trying to figure out that really simple question and it led us to Fred Trump Donald Trump's father who died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd four or five years later the Trump children's sold Fred Trump's empire and it was a massive sale that went through very quietly to another real estate developer in New York\nAnd not let us to just think wow like Fred Trump had a lot more money than we've been thinking through public documents we were able to piece together how Fred Trump\nStarting when Donald Trump was just three started establishing trust for his children so he'd made them his landlords he's sort of putting land and to trust that Donald Trump bone and then he would be paying Donald and his siblings rent and then we started making calls and we were just incredibly fortunate where we had sources who gave us access to\n... and thousands of pages of confidential financial data including two hundred separate tax returns\nAnd the results you know that you've written is really forensic is there a reason why you went into that amount of detail\nWe felt given the allegation that we're accusing sitting president of tax fraud that we owed it to our readers to document that as well as we could\nGo out and she said that the accusation is so serious you have to be forensic and what you're saying\nYeah the New York times to accuse the sitting president of multiple occasions of tax fraud is never happen and it's incredibly\nSerious what all the legal consequences you think now for the president\n[noise] I Know that the city in the state or looking at now various taxes that could be owed both on a city and state level some of it for criminal liability has passed the statute of limitations\nBut there could still be civil fines coming the Internal Revenue service could also open it you have to remember now that the person ultimately in charge of the IRS as Donald Trump\nThat I'm sure as a challenge there should be a right and wrong and all of this and if they did something wrong I Hope somebody is able to show it in a way that results in at least ... taxes being paid on the money that they do\nDo you think that Iraq school will change anyone's opinion about Trump in terms of his support base\n[noise] I don't know I mean I [noise] I sort of try not to write into a political ends or think that way I think what it does is it sets the record straight the Donald Trump got a lot more from his father than you knew you said so many times you know what I'm self made billionaire and my father mainly gave me moral support\nThat line was repeated so often that it has just been repeated as fact but we were able to pin down that it was at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars that was transferred\nBut at the New York times you quote used to say that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to the New York times that the default response is to be well they hate the president that they will write this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be ...\nWouldn't say that it's not political ... were writing into a political world but it's just not what we do Washington is going to say what they're going to say and and that's their job so I just sort of try to figure out on our and how we can best ... to get stories to publication that we're proud of them that are right\nNow\nShe's on Craig narrowed the New York times for some the absence of a political food out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to finance media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as senior editor at the financial news says Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about financing markets for the Financial Times newspaper\nHe wrote a swan song ought to go for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media the immediate response to the New York times story ... is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the awaits crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that got the comedy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that cleanly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was brought on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind those responsible once\nPunished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody is behaving well anyway [noise]\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular story consenting Donald Trump has had a little impacts\nIs it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an unprepared and this to believe actual empirical fact\nA lot of that's possibly does come from the rise of social means yet but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established means ... that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that\nSomebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed essentially that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the F T\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happen to have a\nLot of money just landed in my city by the ... I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits and once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people in\nSmart suits trying to air shuffle them on the around to protect its\nNow that looked like a bank run technically it wasn't they weren't actually taking them on the outs with them but it looks like a bank run and if we had tried publicizing this it would've been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was\nIf we publicize an image like this then we're going to get in trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's great to look for say where in fighting panic\nBanker on basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there is also confidence that you've got to be really really short of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nSaid just because you didn't report it at the time\nI Do not report to the time it didn't particularly seriously occurred to me to say\nI'm ten years on because we have the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about an ... by the ... level of invective and the anger vis a rose the opinion against them as least\nAs an African American to this story hit home for you and served as a catalyst for the for the real miss\nIt and it absolutely did I mean for for me\nIt's it's both about sickle cell specifically and it's also about the reality of health care disparities in this country\nAnd even for someone like prodigy who as a celebrity as this superstar as someone especially in the mid nineties was successful and had access to the best treatment even as a child he had one of the best doctors working in sickle cell he's still went through what he went through\nWere you a little surprised when you know when you you knew that he had sickle cell that he did not even talk about it in his ... as you know in his music as something I'm using my music as a way to inform more people about it\nI mean I I wasn't really surprised I mean knowing music from that era and looking at the image of a group like mob deep\nUm I didn't have a chance to ask you this but I Would guess\nThat that along with that music comes an image of toughness and sort of ... and certainly sickle cell and this idea that he was constantly Iraq with pain was probably not something that he wants to put out there in fact ... Tupac\nIn one of his songs that was basically a distract aimed at all these other rappers included mob deep in in that song Tupac used he sort of weaponized sickle cell and use it as kind of a part of his desk at mob deep so\nProdigy probably was not interested in putting out there that he had this disease that made him or they may have made him appear weak\nHuh and I imagine in in in preparation for your your your story in the real issue must have had to learn a lot of mount circle so absolutely a lotta Linus Pauling tape [laughter] and and you learn why this disease is so painful what it does to the body yeah absolutely\nIt I'm so very very basically the way that it works is that if I normally are red blood cells are so the shape like lifesavers\nAnd their smooth and they move through our body of fairly smoothly with sickle cell does what Linus Pauling found was that it causes this glitch in the hemoglobin which is part of our red blood cells\nIt's where I carry the oxygen through the but it it causes the ... the cells to\nKind of take on a half moon or like a ... fingernail clipping shape is how I looked at it they sickle and they get sticky and tacky and they can clog up the veins and when you exert yourself exercise walking upstairs even it can cause pain all over the body and that was\nPassed and a lot of people can be carriers of it and not know that they haven't\nExactly you can have the trade and not have full blown sickle cell and you can also hassled on sickle cell and that experience it to the extent that prodigy experience to\nAnd from what I Want to thank you very much for taking time to say hey thanks for having me on to it's a great series ...

U. T. in Austin reports\nThat's more than any US Senate candidate has ever raised in One Fund raising quarter\nBeto O'Rourke has been lagging in the polls lately that he is vastly out fundraising his opponent in fact he received more than tripled the amount Ted Cruz race which is about twelve million dollars and the same time period\nUm and it's actually designed to be slightly more difficult to read that in the most fun it's it's kind of tilted in broken\nAnd it's all about at this principle called desirable difficulty which is a phenomenon in learning where you need something to be difficult enough that it holds your interest you know that it doesn't for the person trying to learn the information but not so hard that it keeps them from retaining it\nSo the idea behind this fun is that it kind of break these traditional design principles so that it gets your attention and media helps you retain information a little bit better so there's no public paper on it yet so we can't quite say how well it works but it is a really intriguing idea\nAlways interesting to have you Rachel Ray science editor at the popular science and now it's time to check in on the state of science\nWWE Louis how the breaking island with the\nLocal science stories of national significance California's channel islands a cluster heat islands off of the Southern California coast\nHave been compared to the Galapagos isolated islands with unique ecosystems home to some species found nowhere else in five in the Alan's became a national park in the Nineteen eighties before that they were home to ranching and farming and home to the shore much people for thousands of years before that\nBut a cascade of ecological problems threaten the islands Lance Roscoe news director here at ... is with me now to talk about efforts to protect and preserve ecology there because the CEO and we're good to be with the Irish so tell us about the ecological problems a little bit of a history of this is nothing new rice\nNo it's it's really interesting is sort of like CSI for ... because we have this whole chain reaction of things but uh you as you mentioned we had the ranchers moved in and they brought in cattle and sheep and pigs and other non native things to the islands but what happened was after World War two a lot of DDT ended up in the ocean\nThe DVD ended up and fish now the reason this is significant is the bald eagles which are native to the islands eat these fish\nAnd it builds up to the point in the bald eagles that whenever they would nest the eggs would crack so they would basically they would sit in the exit would crack and the bald eagles came to the point of extinction so they brought in the bald eagles PR captive breeding program\nSo that opens another door golden eagles which don't live in the islands naturally said hey this looks like a great place to live because our our nemesis has gone now so so golden eagles moved out into the islands\nThe golden eagles when they moved out there started to eat the feral pigs are out there and also this rare species of Fox it's called the island Fox it looks like a cat it's a tiny little Fox they're cute they're adorable looking\nAnd the island Fox a very curious about people\nBut the island Fox doesn't have it in their DNA to be on the alert for the golden eagles so the golden eagles basically started feasting on them push them to the point of extinction so you had this whole chain reaction\nBiologist looked at this and said okay we need to grab what a island Fox is we have left we need to bring them in for a captive breeding program to try to save them and so she had this whole cascade of events and so the biologist had to figure out how these things were in a related and they started to fix them\nAnd it's fascinating so what what do you mean if they started to fix\nThem so what happened was they they finally got enough of the bald eagles that they were able to reintroduce them to the islands than the golden eagles to move into the ones that did a trapping program they relocated them to another part of California in into into that as well\nAnd then the island Fox's had gotten to the point where they could re released them onto the islands and and and they they've they've just been growing ... who's a national park service biologist I'm I've talked to them for Twenty years\nThe Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday Thanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last\nPresidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they try to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do it for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand sixteen ... there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there was this something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nAnd I'm In Texas and Florida and North Carolina and uh you know I I think when people see that that um people that legitimately should be entitled to vote and show up at the polls and told they're not on the royals um for whatever reason and it could be because\nThere's there were mistakes programming errors or it could because they were they were improperly purged um that creates a lot of doubt in the integrity of the system one thing that I Would say that every body or in the run up to the election as they should be checking their voter registration that's an easy thing to do on line or if their opinion\nAnd they think they're registered they may not\nYes absolutely and and in fact that's that's an early that can be an early warning sign for election officials that hey maybe I Need to figure out what's going on here maybe there's a problem so I think that's really important to do for the voter 'cause it'll also remind them of where they should be going to vote and they can feel confident about when they show up on election day but I think it's also important for the system\nOh really I'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios ah Charles you looked at how the public sentiment towards election security yeah when it feels if if they think are voting systems are secure do day [noise]\nUm well actually um they they do for the most part I I did a um I did I did a survey I'm just over the weekend on last weekend which I'm I'm replicated something I did in may and I asked um representative sample of voters um potential voters um\nWhether they're competent at least that there um that they're on my own county or locality is prepared for um this November in\nTerms of computer hacking and about I'm sixty percent or so of the respondents said that\nThey were at least somewhat confident and um what um what what is likely to happen in November I'm with\nI'm not surprisingly maybe Republicans being a bit more confident the Democrats and um and that that partisan divide by the way as one of the reasons why I always I'm kind of put an asterisk on\nAny public opinion research being done on public attitudes about confidence and voting whether it be in cyber security or just the vote count in general and that these days everything is partisan and um you know voters expectations\nAbout what's going to happen in November and whether we're prepared on the cyber security side um\nIs as much as is likely to be determined by their partisanship as\nUm attitudes about almost any other issue\nIs voting security politically partisan issue [noise]\nI'm a little bit um I mean it's surprisingly nonpartisan in the sense that I mean there are democratic and Republican differences on the cyber security front um but they are you know they're the sort that a political scientist would write home about but maybe\nOn everybody else would yawn at when you compare it to you know it attitudes about abortion or health care for instance um [noise]\nBut um when you look at other survey research that I've done Democrats for instance are more likely to be concerned about flip on foreign attacks foreign influence on elections um Republicans are more likely to be concerned about um internal\nCybersecurity problems which is I I think consistent with Republican in general about um um fraud and other things that happened domestically\nSaid there is you know that there are those kinds of differences that are gonna reflective of the twenty sixteen election but nonetheless Republicans and Democrats alike are both concern about cyber security and elections\nAnd both of them on a whole are confident that their local initials um are are are doing the right thing\nFor him and very interesting topic well off to take up more of that and maybe even before the weeks before the elections and get an analysis when the elections are over I Want to thank both of my guests Lawrence Norden deputy director\nOf the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at New York university Charles Stuart ... third professor of political science founding director of the election data and science lab
