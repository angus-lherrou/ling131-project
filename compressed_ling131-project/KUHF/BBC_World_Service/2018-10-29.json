Houston and K. U. H. T. T. V. eight point six used in a service of the University of Houston thanks for listening and enjoy your evening [noise]\nFrom Texas Public radio visitors Texas matters a weekly radio news magazine that looks at the issues events and people in the Lone Star state today on Texas matters who gets to vote and who decides who gets to vote\nThere a voter suppression strategy in taxes designed to keep the powerful in power this is Texas matters from Texas Public radio I'm David Martin Davies\nThere were long lines and excited college students during the first three days of early voting at Texas State University in San Marcus this week it's not clear what fired up to Bob cats to exercise their franchise of democracy but they were doing so within Suzie as a reporter leave the lines took about three hours\nAnd some students were skipping class to make sure that their ballots was counted\nThe Senate race between Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and the charismatic challenger Beto O'Rourke has captured the imagination of many but down ballot they are also important races that could be swept up in the possible blue wave of democratic exuberance\nBut then on day for early voting there was no early voting at the university campus\nHayes county officials had only scheduled three days of early voting there\nAnd despite the demand by students county officials say they will not take the necessary steps to address the students concerns is this part of the pattern in Texas of finding ways to limit the access to the polls by populations who have a historic tendency to vote for progressive\nHayes county officials say they're using they're limited voting resources to the best of their ability and they're also along the lines of ... voters in other parts of the county and the county is providing free shuttle rides to off campus voting locations for students\nBut the Texas civil rights project alleges that the county's decision to limit early voting on campus was a violation of the U.S constitution because it targets a class of voter students in this case the Texas civil rights project is threatening legal action\nCongressman Lloyd Doggett a Democrat who represents that area signed a letter with other democratic candidates calling on the haze county commissioners cord to rectify the problem\nAnd a quick note there's been an important late breaking development in this story since it first aired on friday afternoon Hayes county officials held an emergency commissioners court meeting\nAnd the commissioners voted unanimously to add voting locations for early voting and on election day at the Texas State University campus\nThe Texas civil rights project calls this action a victory for voting rights and here's my interview with congressman Lloyd Doggett that was recorded on Thursday Afternoon before these developments\nIt's a big concern I represent all of the Texas sake campus uh I think we need to be encouraging more participation in our democracy there and everywhere else not impeding it we've had now more than three thousand a Texas state Bob cat suit brave some pretty long lunch\nDuring three days of early voting and I think we should celebrate that but there are many more who want to make their voices heard\nUm we certainly think that the county should be providing early voting this week to the purview students on their campus and to provide even more early voting opportunities in the city of um prairie view the surrounding um city\nThere are only a few more days before the first week of early voting is over but it's not too late\nThey could provide more an on campus voting next week\nSo while there's on campus early voting Monday through Wednesday they could keep that voting machine on campus for Thursday and friday and they could provide even more early voting days in the city of ... have you next week but what they could also do is make sure that that were not an exact same situation\nAnd the next election because let it be known\nOur clients and this and then the student body will be participating elections going forward and we'll expect equality and then an elections going forward and they will also be fighting for through this litigation and outside of that making sure that the process is\nBetter than what it has been that they are notified I'm In a in a meaningful way that these decisions are being made and that they are being invited to a conversation about proposals before they are adopted those would be the way to make sure that\nOur litigation and the issues that the students have been working on it are resolved\nIt this is not simply about this two week election cycle this is about\nI'm a history and an ongoing ... ... reality of this county\nI'm not I'm providing a seat at the table sufficiently for the students at prairie view or for the surrounding community and those sort of structural systemic\nUm changes to the process to the notice to the transparency all of those have to be part of\nThe conversation and part of the solution for us to really have moved the conversation forward and and and also a chief for our clients what they've been working for even before they hired us even before they started working for us they were talking about these issues they were demanding these issues and what's unfortunate is that they have to get lawyers\nWho to to go to court because they're ... they're they're not getting the response from their people who say that they represent them I'm\nOutside of the litigation process so that that those sort of systemic things or would be a way to actually resolve what our clients and others have long been fighting for all that campus and outside of it\n... restoration of the voting rights act or something that would work\nThat would definitely help um we litigated that case up to the Supreme Court and defended\nThe process that was in place for over fifty years two or nearly fifty years\nThat what would it would have required um this proposal to have been scrutinized by by someone else including the federal government or federal court it would have not require potentially us to have done the lawsuit that that we have done\nIt would've provided the community engagement process piece that we think is missing 'em through the way that the commissioners are functioning the the scrutiny that the voting rights act gave to places like Waller county that have shown themselves time and time again\nNot just you know with this issue but in the two thousands this county prosecuted student voters and were entered into a settlement ... multiple times related to their tax on student voters they had been scrutinized and slapped by the federal government and by federal\nWhat kind of ... Hindu as few in districts as possible Tim Smith is the producer of rigs the voter suppression play book he says gone are the days of the poll tax but voter elimination ism is still with us it's only gotten more nuanced\nIt wasn't so much rigging the votes for what happens in Texas but for what happens in the U.S Congress\nAnd you know they obviously worked very hard on sort of gerrymandering the district from the Dallas Fort Worth area where I think\nOnly one or two districts ended up being you know I'm sending Democrats to Congress so you know that's you know talk about polka dots I mean they took a poker that district ... or area and somehow managed to turn it read so you know\nThere are obviously trying to get votes and to to Congress in Indiana Republican congressmen and that's why they were gerrymandering\nAnd you know that's what we discovered and then we also as you know went to to Rock Springs\nIn in what did you find in Rock Springs\nWe found a we came across the sheriff is more than happy to sort of work with us in shows her what she had done\nOr very forthcoming\n[laughter] she was a where she had jail the Latino or for voting a who had was a felon but he and he voted in twenty fourteen but she didn't happen to arrest them until close to election and twenty sixteen I think it was in late August and she was herself running for\nReelection the sheriff has a Republican\nAnd it's a district a a Rock Springs is fifty percent Latino so a lot of the people there obviously the Democrats I felt that it was being done to sort of intimidate Latino voters in the you know send a message that said you know you shouldn't vote or you'll end up in jail like this person\nYeah and that's in the twenty third congressional district of Texas rises they have swing district\nIn in which you know every bill that's how we'll heard right yeah and and the district that's been to the Supreme Court multiple times\nRight did you see as you went forward in your documentary making how sophisticated and new ones that people can be when it comes to dealing with drawing districts getting people to the polls keeping people from the polls\nTo get to New York and the Kenyan authorities had to upgrade gym looking at the airport to Nairobi so that it's reached the safety of quality standards that were required by the U.S a there is hope that this move will boost trade investment and also tourism from on that list ... at least in Nairobi um there's a lot more people have you on this morning\n... first of all you tell us about the significance of this flight\nThat well you mentioned a very important milestone for the country Kenya of tests so many as a that is close to four decades\nOr most people think it is the fast to direct flight between Nairobi and that the U.S said that uh what do you have the American or if you recall the Pan American wild outline that flew last in the eighties between there will be and of course that Neal and focus\nThis is very important because of three major issues that he's tourism uh where we see numbers America is currently a produces the most visitors to the countries that are tours him about Seventeen percent growth rate in the last a year that he is from two thousand sixteen to two thousand and Seventeen\nRaking in about at one point two billion dollars we do also have a holiday comes for products that have traditionally been sold to the European markets and therefore uh never will be now has an opportunity to directly I'd be able to interact with the U.S market and so uh you know the quality got floods\nRight I'm I'm just a piece of useless information or do you know the longer a can of journalists who will you look for ... or the ... as we used to walk on on them before it became a famous journalist but let's face it it's not covering y'all go it doesn't have the capacity to recall go\nI'm getting them always struggled quite a lot over the last woman is it's not profitable of the moment I'm just saying this is a silver bullet\n[noise] well I think this is going to work or if everything goes according to plan\nA you rightly said it doesn't carry toggle uh at the moment but then the volume of tried to between Kenya and the United states is not as big a currently speaking to ...\nUh the placement or they should of cargo flights\nBut can you always has about eight or triple seven flights which can easily be converted into a toggle ... cops that are currently at least two major airlines across the world we're talking about ... ... ... neither was\nI Believe can now is can turn around that and being back some of the flights that ah some of the aircraft that are out there are on these\nAnd also um who is on board this flight is expected I'm In the ... or ... or even just the Unabomber speak saws who's on it\nWell the most prominent the gays and bus at a a ... who is a a Kenyan as a foreign affairs minister would also have ah the transport minister from there will be who's also representing the team\nBut most importantly a major league or the number of a big chunk of the two hundred and Seventy four passengers on board agenda these I'm across the region or weren't expected tell the story of the ... flight\nAnd finally before I let you go um yes some of us will be thinking it takes ... it's such a hustle to around Africa wipe tried to go to the streets when you can't get to West Africa easily why no developed in Trump offered them you know ... before reaching for the route\nNow you mentioned that can always has been struggling in terms of uh you know ... ... tons of revenues\nBut I should say that over the last couple of the as isn't despite this struggle most of its growth has been within Africa a non traditional routes\nOr can you always know flights a lot more times towards West Africa which was the case before then and therefore a business within a African you self is quite enormous\nBut then if you look at a ... and the U.S we do also have other at least a for direct flights or that he is in ... and ... and this will be an ongoing for a ... there will be just part of the equation\n... good to talk to think of our ... our colleague based in Nairobi he's a business reports of a [noise]\n\nTwenty three minutes to the next step and visit by the news that some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging produced around the world of sun the commitment to get rid of one used plastic\nIn the next seven years so that things like plastic bags strolls coffee steroids soda water bottles\nAnd most food packaging this means that old plastic produced must be easily and safety reuse recycled or ... one of the organizations who signed up to this is ... chief research and development officer is David ... David welcome to news day just just outlined for ... what exactly unity even signed up see\n[noise] well you really are as I Am very proximity the MacArthur Foundation and you're probably gonna be on global commitment because we've signed up to that commitment to eliminate\nA public are necessary plastic packaging to innovate to ensure that all of our packaging can be probably recycled welcome fostered by twenty twenty five ... and trying to get a written circulate the project that used to it you increase the level of recycled materials and issues now plastic packaging\nHow are you going to do that [noise]\nAh well first of all if it's something that is not necessarily a new to you know leave a back in two thousand and ten we set ourselves up to ... talk in terms of reducing the white about packaging and white packaging and it's when you're Seventeen we signed up to ... we made our commitments drank all of our packaging fully reusable recycler combustible\nAnd so we're them being innovating and not space now for a number of years or so for example we've been friends call of duty in on it\nWhich is a pack it's already a hundred percent recycled and may with a hundred percent every cycle content with partnered with companies like I ...\nThrough a process of chemical recycling ... recycled peachy into our food packaging with Hellmann's in there in the u._k.\nAre the biggest area however ... tackling is issue problematic packaging a because today I'm most problematic packaging around multi use a multi laminate flexible material which today not recyclable\nOr not ripping working with a company the front or fancy shooting Gemini\nProcess called Korea solve which will actually allow it than to action what is the day I normally recycled materials into a recyclable polyethylene and then two years that material packing to decide that we used in places like Indonesia and India\nThat's so really Bastille plastic now isn't it [noise]\nWell so the the chemistry of married at too and she was a tactic to fully reusable and recyclable so this isn't really doing away with plastics at the end of the pie Rick ... is a very important material I don't think the ... here that a plastic remains in the economy\nDoesn't go into the environment and so the innovation is to ensure that\nWe can make all of our partner to be in a few years recycler compost it and then ... problematic packaging which today county recycling therefore it is not remaining part of that ... economy so it wasn't about necessarily moving away from from plastic a day\nA very essential packaging material but ensuring the state and the economy and doesn't go into the environment\nYeah ... is that not possible then to move away from ... together\nWell politics is a very versatile material that we're using across a wide\nRange of packaging a internally we have a framework which talks about\nA sort of less caustic at better plastic but also no plastic so so less traffic is what you would expect but just to ... to reduce the amount of packaging that we're using ... worldwide a better practice it by making up packaging recyclable or with a higher level of recycle content\nAnd that's where their technology such as Chris all come into play habit across for some uh but we're also moving to project so we're looking to for example in the u._k.\nAnd remove the plastics now from PG chip so those are products are now a fully ... at what looking to use all their million troops to replace a plastic tubes or we're looking to launch shape I'm a toothbrush\nTo replace the practical use you know our chief Bush at the same time we'll also talk then innovate within a packet packing itself to ensure that it becomes fully reusable recycle welcome possible by twenty twenty five\nOr I appreciate your time Debbie thank you for joining us David blanche out that a union ... chief\nResearch and development office said something about a commitment that's two hundred and fifty of them as

allows for them to come out now\nIt's hard to be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to\nAccess editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing out of the last two years it's been a initiative started by a FEMA director quit on her I'll quote free to bed which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line basically just need to be female to be a part of it so in case somebody

question I'm joined now by\nAnd ... are valid these were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where did I Believe that the president institutions Cindy president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that's hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but it's a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that\nWell she gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose polo gadgets to be his ministry of finance public editor's is an economist that is very respected in Brazil and someone who has a very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs or a warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that Brazil was a parliamentary system disguised as presidential system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America\nSo the key decisions or they go through the parliament to so the key aspects to observe in the relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition base the indicators that these relationship gives\nWe gave us a da da Da Nang six months for when you go because\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit to show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nChemical yeah I'd I'd go at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant both ... then continues new president but also big challenges ahead\nHe's been accused of having ... tendencies criticized for his comments on homosexuality women and his praise admitted tree dictatorships but despite that he won fifty five percent of the votes\nHis won't support or on the streets of Sao paolo earlier\nThis country is going to move forward because of my cat my president is not homophobic he has a man of God he's a man of character his notes corrupt he will fight for oil Brazilian [noise] if I don't know that\nThat's what's most surprising is the supports both scenarios gained from the business community based at home and on the financial markets surprise me because he freely admits he doesn't really know much about the economy so I Want to know more about how has the power of maverick gained\nOf businesses so I spoke to the BBC South America business correspondent Daniel got us\nShe is definitely the the candidate of the business community at this stage um both so NATO every time he had good polling numbers in this election ... going up and we had a pretty good run this month with the stock exchange basically investors pricing in that he will win\nIn the past the business community used to be tied to a center right candidates but they performed really badly in this election this is an election friend\nAn outsider to politics even those animals that has been in Congress for a long time he's always been a back venture and he presents himself as an outsider to mainstream politics\nWell you have to understand about president economics and market is generally what they read the concern is about stopping left wing parties specially the workers bodies heart for someone who's not in ... which is sort of understand just how much\nOr most businesses big businesses in the financial plays they hate the workers parties and their policies of intervention in states so basically they win brace at any one who stands against that\nEven somebody who's such an outside of it because you know markets and lots of businesses really like stability and predictability so as an outsider who's been such a fringe parts of a Brazilian politics in the past he was still seen as a possible alternative to um his left we're finding\nThe thing is that the sort of center right politicians couldn't get enough votes so the business community you have to make a choice of you know who has the best chance of winning and said well for NATO was definitely the person [noise]\nSo what she did to get the business community on board he named a powerful figure for his economic team that spousal gadgets\nThe bank a man from the business community himself a liberal economist and someone who's promise to carry on with very pro business reforms\nPuzzle gadgets became a very powerful figure in this campaign he's always seen as a sort of prime minister to hide Wilson out of being a president in the sense that you get all the power that he needs\nTo get the economic reforms approved in Congress and move for with this very liberal agenda of privatizing state to companies and know promoting budget cuts and that's something the business community was really happy about\nThat's a good job but he's got someone who's a an experienced economists there isn't it because it or in an interview earlier this month with a global a newspaper Brazil he said in truth I Know nothing about the economy\nExactly shy Wilson I used to actually sort of bragged that he doesn't understand too much about the economy and\nThat's almost seen as a strength of the fact that he's delegating all his powers to ...\nBut a lot of people in the markets are also concerned you know what happens if they have a fight you know if they break up from from the spin this has been described a lot as a sort of a marriage of two people so what happens if they break up\nOr what happens if other people inside it will send US Cabinet or get it you know stand against ... just no one can really predict what will happen because most when I was pretty unpredictable a lot like Donald Trump or which is sort of person that he's been a nearing himself into during this campaign\nSo it's a real concern then that's the business community or or people in Brazil in general are voted in a jar of both of our because they think they'll get ... as a run the economy but they might end up with Jerry both scenario but ... says\nYes that is one concern that and that's one thing that China has been stressing all along that he will not to divorce from ... and that that they will remain married until the end of the term\nBut also now his views about a lot of things are very different from what Pablo gadgets stands for ... in the past ... pretty much a supported interventionist policies\nOr he was always in favor of you know state controlled company Petra brass and now she is sort of changing his speech at least to sit this idea of you know minimal state and in ... companies\nSo it's hard to tell what happens next to ... some arrows old views stand or will his new self and the person of Basel gadgets actually be the one that that goes forward\n... a very divisive figure some people even say quite dangerous to democracy he's seen as north over Terry and figure he said some things are quite offensive to a lot of people of arts um homosexual and women and his approach to fighting crime is not something that the business community is so desperate to sea\nChange in the way the country's run from an economic point of view that for pets are overlook\nWell they say that both so now is just as bad as the workers' party when we're talking about democracy or even a a not as bad as the workers' party\nUm there's a deep hatred within the business community especially the financial markets against the workers' party which they say support regimes like nickel asthma doodle him in as well so they really turned a blind eye to all the things that both ... says\nAbout you know a tax in Congress the Supreme Court and all the risks that he brings to democracy they changed the game a bit around and they say well look the other guys are just as bad as both from\nThe BBC's Daniel guy last in Sao paolo Brazil the president doesn't know much about the economy don't worry his right hand man Paolo gods as does\nAt least that seems to be the hope for businesses and the financial markets he's an avid proponents of free markets and privatized patients get the government running the economy and let the markets work it out but will approach fix Brazil's economic problems\nBrazil recently emerged from the worst recession in its history and it faces rising government debt Gabrielle elicit is a Brazilian economist and associate professor in development economics at Oxford University here in the u._k.\nWe have a very delicate and difficult situation I had the first perhaps and foremost is the fiscal situation which is very worrisome or we have a extremely large deficits\nAnd ruin public that we need to urgently shape public spending for the TV tough labor has stagnated so the challenges are had a considerable\nWhat do you think is the thing that the people who voted for both in our what you think that they will wants him to do first in terms of the economy in terms of business to me honestly it's\nA clear what the demand is in terms of economic policies I think they're voting for him for a kind of like a sense of security and to tackle directly corruption\nI don't think people understand what the stakes are and what the necessary measures are to tackle or economic challenges\nI think they believed that actually he will be able to cut taxes which has been er into that but I don't think that's possible at all given that we have to tackle our current deficit I think they also expect major privatization and reducing the scope for example for corruption in state owned enterprises\nBut now it's also unclear whether or not he will actually implemented\nIn Palo graduates at least we're talking about a man who is a very\nFree market economist believes in the free market so the privatization that some ... some things that Brazil is hired a huge amount of experience with at least with most recent governments more socialist policies have been in place is is it can be a problem to implement those kind of policies in Brazil\nAbsolutely absolutely I think there's a scenario where he embraces ... agenda and try to implement a to Z or extreme liberalism economic liberalism in Brazil\nI think he will face a fierce opposition from unions social movements that will be led by the tea which is actually pretty good at playing the opposition borough so I think we can be looking at an equilibrium similar to Argentina for example where like you have strikes every other day and a very serious political impasse\nThe financial markets have been welcoming both ... ... and the polls are the last few weeks and will no doubt welcome his election they wrong to be so ...\nI think so I think there's a lot of wishful thinking their economic liberalism can only work its magic if it's implemented on a level playing field and we're talking about a country that's marked by extreme inequalities of opportunities for example stream inequalities\nAcross a gender race
