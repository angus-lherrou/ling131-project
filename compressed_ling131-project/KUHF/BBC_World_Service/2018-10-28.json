and\nBut I think you're right to say that most of the guests on this program tend to come from a well more metropolitan areas with perhaps fewer social problems then you come across on a daily basis tell us the kind of issues that you tackle\nWell I mean no these nature has been experiencing complex now for a long\nTime it will be ten years next year since um\nSince we had seen violence and in in

to come from ... from Matthew Green Matthew you've worked in some ... countries for the Financial Times and for Reuters over the years and you've lived in like us having to you\nThat's right it's it's wonderful to be hearing from Nigeria I was back in Lagos about a year ago myself for a couple of weeks and uh I Do miss the place although I was disappointed to\nFind that after returning off for about ten year absence that was still\nNotable shortage of electricity or if any progress is being made on that Chitra but it'll be great to returns like us one day and see the place ... what does that mean for several hours a day without jelly yeah yeah and they don't loan power cuts that but it was prostate single my last visit I I went to report on a small company a coup rentals founded by

well in the city\nAmerica you're an author of aftershock which is a story of surviving pieces you put it it's about posttraumatic stress disorder is it\nYeah that's right I I spent many years working

veterans and their families\nLooking for ways to recover and he'll ah from former of war um and it was an amazing Jeremy I discovered some people doing some really fantastic work lifesaving work\nUh I met a lot of people who were they being for extraordinarily painful experiences are really come out the other side a and I think shows that former survivors where the minutes free all civilian can make remarkable recovery is when that given the right kind of support\nThank you his office topic on the program today the plastics drool a little bit wider than that but it's an example of something that could be consigned to history and European Union countries soon on Wednesday the European Parliament voted in favor of a ban on single use plastic products\nThat would apply to such items is draws plates ... cops in ... which make up more than Seventy percent of waste material in the world's oceans other plastics such as drink bottles will have to be collected separately and recycled at a race of Ninety percent by twenty twenty five on the ... law\nSpeaking during the debate before the vote the Irish Emmy he looked mean Luke men Flanagan described encountering his first plastic capturing the Nineteen seventies and he said nobody thought then that it will prove to be such a threat to the environment\nAt the time we were worried she our main worry on this planet wasn't new care Holocaust nature we realized that the plastic far as food that I had in my hand was actually going to turn out to be more dangerous and I say that now even with who we have in the White House\nBy twenty fifty there will be more classic in the oceans and there are fish fight wish a hundred and ... different marine species known Dr ingested plastic\nCould have been like this work elsewhere in the world specifically could work in the U.S Peter Morici is an American ...\nThis is a professor at the University of Maryland I asked him if he welcomed the legislation from the European Parliament I'm a little\nPuzzled as to what the objective is if it's to reduce carbon that's fine but you have to consider that a sweeping ban\nMay cause producers are manufacturers to come up with solutions that are even more harmful to the environment\n... airplanes because a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nAlso and takes resources to make that metal just like a dust plastic and takes energy and it's heavier ... as a consequence that may cause the airplanes and get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around the metal knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one they're doing the wrong thing or they\nAll I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do\nHowever I don't know that just banning it out right\nAcross the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable resolve\nWhile it's not out right is it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throwing it in a landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single use plastics and a glass bottle you can take back their shopping refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of all bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years whether a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not that single use plastics should be used\nIt's not getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternatives to sweeping is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastic in August ... dozens is it a good thing or is it not in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures to expand that so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well as\nIn not just for the European Union they're certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right what's the only life in your plastic forks or\nAre going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature however one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative\nThat's the problem right then you decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man day at a cost all that is for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic I missed the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic fault surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic ...\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastic probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more arms the environment because in in the nature of the way\nYou use [noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that ...\nWell [laughter] I understand what he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternatives but I Do think that environments degradation on climate change\nThat we're seeing in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need sweeping I'm an action scale on this\nWhat we're playing what are your oh what is my real what do we need that's a problem [noise]\nDemo tests children's language skills when they

those migrants we caught up\nWith on a just a few moments ago and my first question was\nWhat she makes if they started the role that the social media who played in orchestrating what's going on over there\nThey got to know about that got on my face fills capital so that's how they decided to go you know it was amazing thing was the only a couple of days before the carbon that some of them get a you know knew about it great by whatever they could you know I tend to floats\nSomewhat whatever money they had\nAnd then just joined us out of an so it was really important that media the planning for ten dollars for this set up on me\nShow so they have played a role but as anybody who's got a bit of travelling will know even if the best of times it can be difficult to each other since I Want

thing at the moment because uh yeah they I mean that the time\nThey have very little money as I said so they didn't have no\nMoney to pay it to say in a coffee on touch that phones they don't even have sometimes or running water or food so that just like to give that phones off so that you started owning some moments you send them at such and such and then continue so yeah to keep them try\nTo make for all of them not to walk into the network is allowed to play a you know amazingly that company somewhat the ... all the same thing and that was on the way most of the\nYou know but I Know that I say the\n... say three gee even foods that you know a problem sometimes getting uh keeping your fighting Joe it's just a final and a quick call and for you and\nWhat is your your assessments of the extent to which these these have been done before you do is is quite unprecedented over what was going to work out why this is happening now given that you know we've had access to social media and so for quite some time I know uh\nYou know some people that had already done this migration before so they know why all the hassles fall and the way what to say you know that and they find says that but I think five ... than we know that if\nThey touch any fault that Iran in anything\nThat is and I got to be in a row house and she is with that Margaret ...\nIn Mexico you're listening to that going boating and and what really strikes me that really is is that this is no longer a story about ... works and difficulty getting hold of dates or if it's\nIf you will develop more boring idea of just keeping your ... and yet we all hearing about the role of the networks in constructing the thousands of people\nYes I I I I think I mean they had seen these images actually in it ... the last few days and of course because\nThat one needs that has been that country unless absolutely have to know none of us which we wouldn't light or you know to to say you know just grabbing some money and some ... and getting into the cat and like that she knows\nIts end this thing to have to do with your life you know and\nThat is interesting to see how that social media in a way as you know one could say kind of helping them ... feet to find find their way through things um and also guiding them in a way because we know that this is not the first time this has happened died that nev as many migration trial is happening around the world\nIndeed and you're very interested in and you've been following over the years it guns and some of the other um big cause of migrations of people who cross borders on these perilous journeys and some of the apps and services taping\nYes is it because it is and I'm involved in if he leaves projects which should be looking at migration and some of them coming from two sides to sipping consent ... artist in in in Croatia and Slovenia and hungry accept ... and\nAnd and they've been involved in a particularly when cutting hungry mean calls\nAnd it has been actually made it out for\nThe migrants that hitting hungry and trying to come through Hungary this is about three or four years ago and I said Teflon hungry now they've kind of food is except that they were so concerned about these people are writing and not being able to get the ... ... what the rules with the registration and\nA train ticket medical cat those kinds of things they made an app for as they arrived in Hungary that would help them to actually ...\nRight yeah so so many different ways that technology has been used in these kinds of settings what's going on for now thank you very much for speech you as a pregnant goes on but we're going to the sense of computer science and criminal investigation now you were the crime scene and the investigators swapping for the un I and others are tracing fingerprints\nAnd then there were the digital people looking at ... phones will clues married in the ... of household appliances British politicians have just been hearing about the role of digital forensics as\nPossible wind up parliamentary investigation into the states as forensic science one of those reporting on the competing ... ceremony is head of the digital forensics unit at crime field university just outside London Michael's with Sarah after she'd been speaking slave politicians I wants to know more about\nThe kinds of investigations in which she gets involved\nWas a suspect I'll buy in the case and it was a Robin you washing machine way you could control it using an ... say we went off to praise whether the suspected actually hit the button on the washing machine physically and that was in the building\nOr whether they were using the app on the night of fighting and if they ... and I was the fighting in the house who was the final slap\nTo the dismay and going through records from so fucking towers\nYeah so we're looking for more information on the line about whether it was connected to why if I had to take any pictures or any location based on the find\nMore information could you pick up the washing machine itself\nSo it was ... when a set thing had been pre set say if you would say ... five AM you could get that information I Wonder if they useful things are able to get where she could tell whether that washing had been set on via the bus and or not from the washing machine itself\nWhere is that in the washing machine guns just within the micro prices the can down there to talk to\nYou as a that's a small dates chip which we had to re maize and then report on two in the second floor to read the check\nAnd another ... but you know the ... that this would be a particular manufacture I'm sure many of these systems are quite ... actually I just wonder how how you even have a lot about data fall because it must vary according to manufacturers\nSay that's a nice ... digital forensics it makes ... ... much more fun you're looking at a puzzle and trying to ... how each of these devices wax on how each of them still is safe to say it does involve a lot of\nPlaying with the device and trying different types of activity until ... stop too much and you can then walk out I had this cat and appears to me that the devices all know the devices seized and from that translate into something meaningful\nSo it's a bit like CSI were you have the washing machine you take your lab you're wearing a white covered everything of course is completely ... everyone's incredibly attractive in the lab and then you've got like a computer that some of the list of ... and then somebody presses a button on a big green light flashes saying ... served it must be definitely like that\nA sad thing that I Know what ... some fortune at age ... computer geeks and ... that we ... that are trying the washing machine again and again with different cycles and try and get with the fire and\nTrying to find connects to the like Hawaii fight that the washing machine was on trying to find a way from the device not and why\nAnd each time just looking at a day though it was still hold\nThe data itself comes out in binary format on from there it's just a nine year old case if going three and physically ... patents\nWhat was the outcome of this investigation around the washing machine\nSay we're able to say that the fighting was east and I was on site and that helped to shy is that the the suspect was indeed involved in in St and\nSo the suicide of this that is the ... investigative it's computer science this is forensics in action and would I guess be quite typical of the many investigations and what you're going to vote\nYes a lot of the investigations are they called in a department as well as the mall is like devices say something unusual all I really tricky binary for ... they haven't seen before and they're looking for that ... such to a three and try and translate that into something they can ease\nGiven that much crime and you know digital crime scams especially all global and then they show what role can you as digital forensics expert play and hoping to get some ... some of these scams for instance\nThat can be really varied depending on the nature of the devices involved but usually if we've got a device say the victims device you can find quite a lot of information about the day so that we received\nChamberlain said what I'd like to talk about this this and this and it led basically said to him in the life of this massacre we need to act immediately that is essential for us to help these three million Germans in Czechoslovakia because their lives are an immediate danger\nAnd Chamberlain is on so it was very well\nAnd after the talks a rich Chamberlain did agree that Britain would agree to that law annexing parts of Czechoslovakia\nIt turned out that there was not any truth a tool in this story but it was a story that was everywhere on the German media and it it spreads around the world to German while this propaganda\nSo this was fake news of its die you have this new at the time shiny media I'm a writer and and I guess that it was associated with ... other words people tend to trust that they were more likely to believe it\nI think what's really interesting is that even if people didn't trust it even if people knew that there are being told lies\nIt changed the atmosphere it introduced elements of doubt I mean that was one of the things that was very clever about Hitler's propaganda to neighboring countries that would ... the seeds of doubt or it would introduce elements of\nAnti Semitism let's say which wasn't there in the chicken Slovak media for example the other thing was that\nThere would be these invented atrocities\nWhich even if they weren't true the with the sentence and yeah it didn't happen but it might have happened and it might happen and it fed a sense of unease and the sense of fear and then the sad thing is that among people who wanted to believe and who sympathized with the Nazis they could\nKnow full well that they were being told Layton lies\nBut they would think well you know a propagandist ... than the others and and may not be true but it's going to serve this future truth which trumps the current reality\nWhat about the technological approaches well comparisons if any can we make between rage in Nineteen fifty eight and then maybe mainstream media and possibly even social media and that kind of thing\nOne of the power those in the share newness of it radio was very new and international radio was even knew a and it meant that people would use to this being bombarded with global information constantly which was being constantly updated as well every news bulletin would bring a slightly different\nReality it was the beginning of a very media centered world and this one moment when to Czechoslovakia government announced live on radio of this he said agreed in principle to sacrifice parts of its territory to Germany\nThat was immediately a huge demonstration and the central Prague and the crowd\nMoved north towards the government building but towards the radio building even more interestingly they actually by to break into the right to a building\nAnd one of the people actually got into this data and sat down at the microphone and started rather an articulate the bus nonetheless with a very clear message saying we don't want to ... to ... Hitler is demanding\nAnd this actually went out on that and so it was an interesting example of the consumers of of radio talking back so it was a kind of into activity\nYou know I can sit and they say that very interactive indeed storming the radio station that said David vote in his book here my voice is a fictional accounts of those events ... into will events that we were describing ... get out and around with ... you know this is in the Nineteen thirties talking last I knew ...\nAnd actually in a way that ... not buy health related news and I think can I say this now I think the government to set that they want to start his misinformation disinformation again in statton strategy document safe because they need\nA nice just bandage and ... and it could be kind of a joke and it's not this is not to get consent of the stuff that ... which is saying the continued misused by powerful people\nTo manipulate testing will either direction they want it to happen at that point in time\nYeah that makes us being weaponized voice on the laugh yeah just flunking out of the guys yeah like news around which doesn't necessarily move the debate tone um so I I enjoy\nListening to that I was reminded of some coverage we vote here in the year to um the resistance fighters they shouldn't be Ninety two years I was in Yugoslavia in conflict and\nThey pointed Internet streaming and then in the Nineteen nineties shrine Ariana ... anybody everything is streaming audio online to circumvent the middle of it just ... regimes censorship you know they found that transmits as they used the Internet as a transmission channel\nThat that they suddenly actually interacting with it and and and creating a resistance to a backup today to me I mean I guess that's one thing today that is different with sexual ...\nNew Jersey ... station you can actually joined ... and actually saying that this is not to put ... in fact David ... is in place much much more ... with us today if we wanted to have got sorry this isn't right and we can\nWe can get involved into believing that thank you so much for the society has been injured in Seattle I'm Derek Mitchell and we'll see you next week by by\n[noise] I'm Steven governor and the next freakonomics radio in the United states in ...

Pittsburgh\nPresident Trump closely followed Pittsburgh developments and offered expressions of deep sympathy and distress for all of those affected the attack preceded a day of to campaign stops the president has said he intends to visit Pittsburgh\nBut as NPR's Mara Liasson reports with general elections less than two weeks away this case and the case of Caesar say\nAccused of mailing pipe bombs to key Democrats will inevitably be on the minds of voters\nFor the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR's Mara Liasson reporting from Washington in Germany questions are being asked about whether uncle of Merkel's federal government will survive after major election losses in the state of has asked me Nicholson has more\nPut them in the result indicates that goes on to the medical policy the conservative Christian Democrats on ... the center left Social Democrats have lost at least ten points each which commentators believe is down to widespread disenchantment with the federal government\nThey don't fully understand what the specifics of this change are they just know that it's not good for them [laughter] and and they may not know much about artificial intelligence for example but they've heard the term\n... and they know that they are increasingly disposable they feel that in their ... and something that I think that technology evangelist really forget about is that this is a social cultural moment people don't work\nFor money if they can help it what they work for is pride a sense of accomplishment a feeling that they're contributing something this is a lot deeper than whether or not I've got a job and whether or not the job pays enough it's who am I\n... it in America we are defined by the work we do you know you introduce yourself to a party and say oh I'm a writer or or write a radio show hosts ... ... ... ... Silicon Valley forgets about this 'cause oh well you know we'll give them universal basic income well that doesn't solve this problem\nDo you see that yourself like you know you grow up in Ohio you don't live there anymore but you have gone back for sometimes large periods of time to to do is writing do you see that change like if you were talking and nobody else can you perceive that change yourself\nAbsolutely oh yeah yeah no question about it\nWhat's ... what's changed like how how do you feel like the Ohio of your child head it's different\nIf you are from a small town and I think that's the thing it's true not just of Ohio but any place where where are you maybe grew up in a small town there was a a special kind of social cohesiveness\nThat has really eroded all over this country and I think people have a great longing for that a longing for community and the fallout from this lack of social cohesiveness is obvious\nPeople are have been tossed overboard\nTo fend for themselves rather than having a real sense of belonging and community you know what we ought to do I think is sort of question some very basic premise sees about what we want modern day capitalism to look like what's it supposed to do for us\nWe've done a good job in this country of for example destroying unions a lot of people's sort of social cohesiveness their lives their connections their sense of community came from unions it came from their place of work it came from their their civic organizations a lot of that has disappeared or is in the process of disappearing\nI mean you're talking to the fabric of community breaking apart does that\nAll come back to sort of finances in economics and jobs which in time and then coming back to technology yeah say\nPrecisely and and that's where I think technology plays into this you know we've been rushing headlong\nInto a technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we've been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but [noise]\nBut is it has a specially accelerated it seems to me since the late Nineteen seventies or in the early eighties and at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits\nOf all of this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community you know we talk about social networks um and how people can forum online communities that's not a replacement by any\nThis programming it's ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the flying dutchman story of a quest for true love open season in the restored for them to bring Nineteen through November second Houston grand opera dot org\n... years and waiters but it isn't true for people who drive ... who do odds and ends assigned to them by the Wednesday TaskRabbit who delivered seek out the gets ordered on rub hub so what's the dividing line between the jobs that has stayed fairly steady and those that are new unseen\nFull technology obviously except says historian Lewis Hyman it's not really he says American businesses have loved the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups in very low unemployment rates and the shift in the economy that we're seeing about tack\nIt's about us and the choices we make Lewis timing is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp how American work American business in the American dream became temporary Lewis thanks for your time\nA real pleasure to be here thank you\nSo when you hear people say things and I'm sure this comes across a year and certain deft every now and again but he was saying you know like she because of the Internet you know so much work is now ... to get there and there's not that much security there's so much freelancing\n[noise] what do you think when you hear that kind of complaint [noise]\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms and futuristic robots and in the book I really push back against this pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it solves business problems check doesn't drive change it consolidates it and things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps\nAre really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of service economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nAnd it's certainly the the place where the economy is growing\nYou talk about um a system that kind of manages this this gig world in a way or that helps to um called the criminal system and um I Wonder if you will talk a little bit about what that system does a lot of people probably have not heard of this\nYeah there's people who have heard of it because they use it everyday and there's people with celery jobs who have never heard of it and\nIt's hard it is so hard for people with salaries to understand the financial and worked in the lives of shift workers you know many many you know about you know a thirty ... thirty percent of the sort of workforce who basically don't know\nWhen they're going to work that week they ... if you are working at a restaurant if you're working\nIn retail you may not know when your shift is gonna be the that week so how do you plan for and Carlos ... is a workforce management tool it's like a time card and electronic time card and what they do\nIs they say All right well when our customers coming into the coffee shop well we'll have most workers them and we can predict it using software\nAnd that's what role scheduled them and the schedules can shift from week to week depending on what the algorithm say depending on who has you know worked a lot in the past week they want to make sure to keep workers\nFrom getting overtime from even qualifying fulltime workers so they don't repaid healthcare and this is\nIncredibly disruptive for working people in two ways the first way is they can't plan for another job so even if they wanted to have another part time job this scheduling software is largely one sided and\nYou know that is tricky um so they can't plan for the job the camp playing for childcare they can't plan for education it's a lot of the things that\nWe say well why don't they just get go to school while you can't go to school if you don't know when you're shifted right ever and the other part of it is the volatility of income so we talk a lot in this country about income inequality we talk about income volatility\nAnd there was this amazing study done a couple of years ago\nBy J. P. Morgan that left wing bastion of radical fought J. P. Morgan ... they found that\nFour average households median households in America a little over half of those households have month to month fluctuations of thirty percent in their income thirty percent of Matthew ... from valves\nThere yeah and most of the vast majority about eighty percent of that fluctuation is driven by ships it's driven by whether or not you get paid or whether they get ... hours that month and so\nIt's just a very different life than most of those who were in the top twenty percent the salary professional class really experienced and it's it's a very frightening and insecure life\nTo ... you know we've talked about how um the gig economy in many ways it's not the least bit new ah certainly not for women certainly not for you know migrant farm laborers um\nBut but for the population as a whole it's a bit of a it it's a bit of a newer thing where where do these things go from here I mean not not necessarily what you want to see them go but where and like looking into the crust of all do you think they're really going to be in five ten Fifteen Years\n[noise] well I think when over the next crisis economic crisis happens we're going to see just a wholesale shift so one of the things you mentioned before with the unemployment rate and you know economists are debating right now over whether we should use that to understand people who don't have work or whether we should understand labor force participation rates\nAnd we know that participation in the labor force has dropped about between six and eight percent since two thousand eight so there's a whole swaths of people who are just not working and then the next recession we're going to see that again and then the jobs are gonna be created our\nFreelance jobs and we're going to have to figure out a way to support people as they enter the workforce to say look you're not going to get a traditional job\nBut you're going to have to find a way to make it work in this new economy and I think that on the left on the right in the book I lay out both conservative and liberal approach to this\nBecause I think it's important that there is this a stall job but we need to realize that world is gone but we need to make this world we live in now work for us and not hopes for a future that may or may not come I don't know whether you know a a robot urine or future but I Do know that we have income volatility and we have joblessness\nAnd we have also the ways to make that work for people if we just sort of get together and do it\n[noise] Lewis I'm In is the author of camp how American work American business in the American dream became temporary housing associate professor of economic history at Cornell\nLewis thank you so much as great\nA real pleasure thing [noise]\nBy the\nTime

you\nWant them back innovation hub and turn them you know leave then\nRushing headlong\nInto its technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but but you know specially accelerated it seems to me the late Nineteen seventies in the early eighties\nThat's author Brian Alexander who I talked to earlier in the show about how much new technology like automation and robotics has I've ended jobs and communities especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all of this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander says it's been particularly powerful in states where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scarce but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives these sorts of changes have been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded their bikes company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nI think the Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really uh but I Know of has really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications\nUsing switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies the about argues change they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage is who made dresses to order who had had shots at a time when men and women thought it was undignified to go out without a hat all those jobs more or less ultimately came to an end\nYou can't turn back time you know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of
