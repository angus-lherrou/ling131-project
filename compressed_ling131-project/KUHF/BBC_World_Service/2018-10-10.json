stage after she performs she'll get really political\nAnd she won four awards a lot of people knew she would win awards but she saved getting political so to speak up for the end of the show the very last award that she want her fourth award\nThat's when she said you know she was so happy to win an AMA because it's voted on by the public and then she uses that as a segue to transition to the fact that you know what else is voted on by the public\nYou guys that November ... election so make sure you get out there for the midterm elections and you vote it was a real swift\nQuick transition but she got it in there and she didn't say much more so she kept a very short and sweet but notice how she said that little bit of being political towards the end of the show when she won the fourth

I was trying to do it I I Hope so I Hope that\n... that it I I'm not looking to yeah you're right we're not we're not looking I mean you know we all I think\nSome of us thought maybe they wouldn't maybe the cable networks and I work for CNN I Love CNN uh but maybe the cable networks wouldn't carry the whole victory lap with Kavanaugh live last night although I Would argue that it was newsworthy in itself\nRight I mean it is the swearing in of a new justice and the White House by the president\nAnd an incredible exercise in ... white male grievance and year you were found innocent justice cabin on ... I Apologize on behalf of the nation which include you and me and then John\nYeah which is why I I did a campaign rally as opposed to a a solemn national event I didn't even give out our phone number eight four four seven four or five eight to five five if you want to join in on the conversation but that didn't stop Donna\nIn Everett, Washington from calling in Guyana thank you for coming into America on the line\nThank you for having ...\nWhat's ... what do you think about all this\nWell I I Would like to say that Trump ... uh tactics to win the election or not a fact is he did not win the popular vote he only won the electoral votes so apparently the electro college it's susceptible to his tactics but at the clock elation is not\nAnd I also want to remind you that there are more women in this country than are\nTrue but as as we have seen there's a huge chunk of them who voted for the president\nYeah that may be changing this election at least for the terms that the judge Kavanaugh saying what was I think the line I opened our first\nJohn Lennon ... these are old men on the Senate I think we need to turn one that's\nAlready done I'm going to have to leave it there 'cause I Want to thank you very much for calling in to America on the line Donna in Everett, Washington let's go to the middle of the country I'm Claire in Madison, Wisconsin thank you for calling into America on the line\nHi Jonathan thank you I Love your show by the way you\nI'm I Am seeing a trend and you discussed it you touched on it a little while ago [noise] uh it's very disturbing to me if Donald Trump Mitch McConnell and others are going to start it kicking these women who have come out in light of the Brett Kavanaugh issue\nAnd if they're going to get picked us as a bunch of hysterical truth which they came very close to saying yesterday\nI think they're making a huge mistake number one and number two it just proves they don't get it\nNow clear yesterday we had um her name is escaping me but I Believe she was also calling in from Wisconsin Linda that's right Linda from Wisconsin she calls\nThe two o'clock on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven consider Amazon dot com went shopping online Amazon\nContributes a portion of each purchased the Houston Public media with you access the Amazon website from Houston Public media dot org slash Amazon follow us on Facebook get you some public media and tweet us ... Houston Public media\n[noise] Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line we're back with Joan Walsh of the nation in buzzfeed's Ben Smith so for all the talk of a blue wave a takeover of the house and maybe even the Senate\nThere are complaints that the Democrats don't have a unified message and so my message to both or do they need one band\nBasically not I'm In mid term in midterm elections are typically to somebody you know they're driven by dislike of of the of the ruling party this case you know Donald Trump the house the Senate and that gives Democrats room to run very different campaigns in different places\nAnd so you see a Democrat in West Virginia running a campaign in which he supported Brett Kavanaugh for instance and Democrats in Florida and Georgia running kind of a much more progressive campaign you've ever seen in there and I think you know you you're going to see a very very wide range and\nAn who wins and who loses in there we'll we'll we'll say it will shape the party going forward in\nGermany I mean do do are are Democrats running national races or or to pick up on Ben Ben with her or highly localized races or a combination of the two\nI think they're mostly localized I I just spent two weekends with Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA you know watching her talk about Medicaid expansion which is actually popular among sixty percent\nOf Republicans are watching her barely mentioned even her opponent Brian Kemp and not mentioned I don't think I should be careful I don't remember her mentioning Donald Trump even wants seriously\nIf she talks about ... cradle to career education she talks about losing eight million dollars a day because the state did not take federal money to expand Medicaid\nOr it it's it's a national race there's a lot of national attention there's national money on both sides\nOr on the ground working for progress in places where I stay diminished rations I often are very conservative\nAnd um you know I I just take issue with the idea that ... that we can on that we can stereotype or even caricature and such an immense piece of this country politically culturally and racially for that matter it it all off and announced to light washing when they're talking about the um\nThe working class that I'm a native of in this part of the country so and the problems that exist on many levels I think\nAnd and that's what I Love about your book I I I'm going to admit I didn't read the entire thing but I read big chunks of it and what I came out what I boost appreciated was it sort of lists the veil off of a narrative an American narrative that\nBeing being poor\nAnd the situations that the quote unquote poor get themselves into our situations that are the the sole province of\nPeople of color and African Americans in particular and what you do in your book is make it clear that no no no no these are the situations that\nUm the poor writ large\nAre buying them so these are are living in and um I don't know I guess as someone who writes about politics and writes about race\nA off in that I actually found myself very appreciative than your story is one that takes into account um\nThat what you were living in living through and what people of color are living through our one in the same it's just your prospect you're coming at it from your perspective as a as white and as a white woman\n... yeah I mean you know I don't think that I cast as went so far to say one in the same because the the um the particular thing about my experience of poverty at a white\nWoman is that um you can as I say in the book simultaneously have racial privilege and economic disadvantage to I Would not put my ... and I don't think this is what you're suggesting but I wanted to be clear that I I Would not put my experience up you know next\nTo a woman of color who was raised in poverty and say we had the same experience however there certainly are more commonalities and and\nThen one would have had to leave for a mom and dad\nYes sure um you know political discourse there's often very artfully leverage to divide people on color lines on a among the poor uh is is a incredibly destructive for for our country and um you know it's been very heartening\nFor me the last few weeks on book tour all over the country and having people of of all backgrounds and colors and even political persuasion come through signing lines and say\nUm our stories different and yet it's the same then subtitled in my book is um a number of working hard and being broke and the richest country on earth and and while there are different strata of disadvantage and privilege with within that experience it is a shame fully a common one in this country\nAnd you know that could sue something new to this is what I was thinking of when I'm I've struggled to find a word commonalities with you you grew up in Kansas and the Nineteen eighties in the Nineteen nineties when President Reagan was in office and convincing America that government was the problem not the solution and he used terms like welfare queen\nThat have an impact on how your family and other working for Kansas viewed government social programs\nYou know I think it did that a language of course had had and what's code in some ways for a a really um a racist take on the role that government programs\nUh serve in this country and in fact most people in this country on public assistance are white just Enron numbers\nUm but a lot of that discourse in mind during my childhood was ah was really targeted specifically at African American women\nI didn't have the political savvy to understand\nThat in my largely white rural place and all I understood was\nAs a bunch of single poor moms in my family and I and I understood that we were people who would qualify for such programs and and I also understood therefore that there must be some shame inherent to seeking such assistance and and that was absorb deeply by by the the women specifically in my family I think\nOne of the narratives that comes out of the twenty sixteen election is this notion that Trump capitalize on the fear of the other which may be just another word for bigotry and you\nWrite a lot about um the other or euros vividly about what it's like to be white and also other can you in the less than two minutes that we have\nExtra expand on that\nSure where when I was I'm not a not just the first from my family to go to college but the\nFirst from my farm house to to finish high school so when I arrived on at a State University even and I was I sense that I was at the uh on a lower rung of some economic pecking order and and I was really um different for being having a rural background and and coming from a place where people\nBroke their backs with manual labor and and didn't get a chance at such things like a college degree so um so that's really when I came into kind of a class awareness and when I was a kid\nI I never would have used the word poor about my experience 'cause I I had enough to eat and I had a roof over my head but it turns out that what that is what I was and um and so it is a particular kind of other that can be physically invisible but the other two experienced by um by millions of Americans right at this moment\nAnd real quickly molested admitted that we have left uh did you give a quick uh an update on how Kris Kobach who's doing in his gubernatorial campaign against the Democrat Mark Kelly\nMm well I haven't seen any recent polling but I Do know that um his opponent laurels Laura Kelly has a a fierce um activated and\nA contingent that is on both sides of the Iowa by the way she's been endorsed by over ... over two dozen current and former GOP lawmakers in this state which I Believe must be unprecedented on and so I'm Sorry\nTo cut you off are gonna have to leave it there in about six seconds we're going to take a break and come back with more America on the line\nSupport for Houston

more\nJonathan Capehart and this is America on the line and news and call in show about mid term politics from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWe turn now to Wisconsin where Republican Governor Scott Walker is in the reelection race of his career and joining me to talk about this bellwether state our our regular contributor\nMilwaukee residents Charlie Sykes author of how to write lost its mind and Craig Gilbert political reporter in Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel and Wisconsin listeners we want to hear from you call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five to tell us\nWho you're voting for and the issues that matter in Wisconsin that's eight four four seven four or five talk\nGet Craig and Charlie welcome to America on the line Charlie welcome back thank\nI'm Craig let me start with you I'm clearly Governor Walker's reelection races that the high high profile race in the state and your latest article you report that while Walker has strong support from the conservative base he's struggling\nTo reach voters in the middle why do you think that is and why are swing voters so important in this race\nWell there were important because Wisconsin's are really evenly divided state they swing by definition Scott Walker is always one independent voters in his victorious campaigns but he's losing them right now so his problems really go to sort of\nWhat we call it sort of true independents people that really don't lean toward either party but he also has a problem with with kind of soft Republicans independent leaning moderate Republicans a lot of these people\nBelong to that minority within the party that have major qualms about Donald Trump and the polling shows that they're supporting Scott Walker but by ... much smaller margins than the party base and they're also\nBut I'm going to disagree with him just a little bit in terms of there being a swing voter in the state of Wisconsin because there is a swing vote in the state of Wisconsin it and the last forgotten generation X.\nUm those voters from about age thirty eight forty to fifty to fifty three have a got a ten ten point difference in their performance for presidential candidate democratic presidential candidates\nAnd democratic gubernatorial candidates so when you're talking about those kinds of issues as bread and butter those uh you know his wallet issues whether it's student loan debt childcare family medical\nWe have um what are you going to do for retirement ... for the first generation do not have employer provided pensions by and large you know those economic issues or what's going to drive that that demographic to the polls and decide whether or not they vote for Tony even worse or they vote for the longest serving Gen x politician American history that being Scott Kevin Walker\nI got that this time yeah\nHey it's great I agree with you there are I mean I think there are swing voters I mean there were five hundred communities in Wisconsin that voted for Obama and then voted for Trump four years later I mean there are definitely swing voters we know they're not a lot of them but they matter if they're going to matter in this race\nYeah but I you know here's the is the one thing I'll say about that is it you know basically last Thirty years Republicans have won gubernatorial races in the state of Wisconsin the only guy who's one is a Democrat is Jim Doyle now he won in two thousand two but that was after sixteen years a Republican and that was where there was a third party candidate Tommy Thompson brother who got\nEleven percent a hundred and eighty thousand votes enjoy one sixty five thousand\nThe real model for how Democrats should win and gubernatorial gubernatorial election in Wisconsin It's two thousand six where it was a wave election year and you know we always say you got to turn them on if you want to turn them out so if you're not talking about the issues they care about you can't expect them to come out to the\nPolls and when it came to do to do inspiration than it is to do to do motivation persuasion\nScott Scott Ross in Madison, Wisconsin I mean thank you very much for calling in and use the last three minutes or so to give Craig and I'm Charlie a chance to weigh in on everything that they heard\nFor just a couple of things if it's funny to get all those calls were Madison I mean that just might be like the most politically engaged place in America in fact it's like there is no other like ultra Baluch county that votes or that turns out at the rate that Dane County which is Madison\nDoes I mean it's just and it has an impact on state wide elections well we had a bigger and blue or can weigh in on this\nYeah try and we had ... don't forget about Gore T the extremely conservative independent who is calling in from Madison but go ahead Charlie\nYeah no I mean I we we we we just sort of went into a fast of of of Walker bashing here and I don't actually disagree with Gordy about the ah the corporate welfare and the\nAnd the transfer of wealth but they also understand that the Wisconsin's a much larger states in Madison and got\nWe've got a lot of

three hundred thousand dollars\nCorrect yeah three hundred thousand dollars yeah was shooting the expensive this\nAnd that price has come down considerably how much would a burger today costs\nUm it's it's hard to tell you can only do calculations because for the prices come down to four is it needs to be scaled up to production and you need to know exactly what the production system is\nI'm having with a couple of some show that you can scale up to let's say twenty five thousand leader bioreactor which comes out about ten thousand a meat for ten thousand people a year\nThat price will be around ten dollars for a number of the cost will be ten dollars for their costs yeah and it's of course the old way too high\nA\nJersey but even in this country cellular grown meat on the menu the offerings were strictly vegetarian including burgers and hot dogs made from plants but not from the sounds of animals\nThat's partly because no one has scaled up to a level where they can feed hundreds of

figure out are regulatory situation us or we could do it here but it's much more likely to be outside the United states are him for countries that we're we're talking so we're optimistic um a few of

or on the equator on two sides so definitely stands out it's a pasture ride balloon so I'm Carrying twelve passengers every morning with me\nAnd this is my fortieth a fiesta that I've attended iPhone thirty seven of them and I'm Still in all every single time it's a beautiful sight out there it is\n... what's your ...\nAh my balloon is black on the bottom with a rainbow the rainbow colors coming down from the top and it's believed that holds or about a four people and it's amazing and this is my third year in fiesta but I've seen it every year in my life and I love it\nSavannah we heard how your dad is this experience sort of celebrated pilot what's it like to have him as your guy does he given you tips for flying over the years\nI'm definitely I actually\nFunny enough I didn't want to learn how to fly from my dad 'cause as great as he is he's my dad didn't want him telling you what to do their homework flier balance so I had a different instructor but now especially as I'm becoming a more experienced pilot he's been a very great mentor and helped me\nTo work towards the things I Want to accomplish\nRight I'm sure you're very comfortable up there in the sky but do you worry about your daughter up in a balloon\nOf course because it's so my daughter so as as accomplished as she is and I know how good of a pilot she is um I still require after every landing to give me a call and let me know that she's down in safe show yeah I'm Still bad for sure what what are the risks up there so high in this guy\nThe risks are nominal um provided that you're a really uh you know paying attention it's like any other form of aviation um the number of accidents that happen are very rare and then it's infrequent however when they do or they can have some dire consequences so um that's the real risk that are out there and\nAre mitigated by you know good calls on on the field before you ever take off so it's really a pilot judgment and making sure that the pilots picking a good day to fly\nWell there are some changes to the fiesta this year one drone will be allowed to fly with the balloons to take pictures and there have been some concerns or by local pilots maybe you're one of them about not having enough places to land because the area around Albuquerque is becoming more developed\nWhat about that if you notice any big changes to your sport\nOh the the Albuquerque areas definitely changed dramatically like\nUm when I started flying the entire north part of Albuquerque was not built up into anything is still open fields and now we're really truly flying into congested area every single flight so um but the city of Albuquerque is very very ballooned friendly so the city itself does\nMates that basically any school park golf course anything this city owned is open and and welcoming to bonus\n[noise] that's Troy Bradley and his daughter savannah who are hot air balloon pilots flying in the forty seven Albuquerque\nInternational balloon fiesta\nThings people have

other places I feel as though we're in a period where leaders feel as though they can get away with punishing political opponents they don't like\n... can you tell us about Mr shrunk jeeze plans to set up an organization to promote democracy and human rights in the Arab world he loved being in the state Senate he [noise]\nI don't think he loved as much as a mom had many friends in the media and the think tank but I don't think he lobbied much on this issue\nThe idea of ... the root called dawn democracy in a world now was an idea he discussed with few people they incorporated the group in

who's been campaigning for gay rights now for more than four decades worldwide\nI think the whole issue is very complex and there are some gray areas but over what I'd say the Supreme Court's decision today was a victory for freedom of expression\nFreedom of expression includes both the right to express and a point of view but also the right to not be forced to express or facilitated view with which you disagree\nSo the upshot of today's ruling is ashes cannot be legally forced to aid the promotion of same sex marriage by putting such a slogan on a cake\nBut it also means that gay bakers cannot be compelled by law to decorate cakes with slogans against gay marriage so we work both ways certainly and it's got much wider implications and just gay rights does it say price it at\nThat ... that people could discriminate on the grounds on the basis of religious belief that is what complicates it\nUm no I I think it's belief not religion it it's about an idea whatever the motive um the court is saying that\nA business doesn't have a right or doesn't have a duty to promotion idea whatever the idea is if it conflicts with its basic fundamental beliefs now this issue is much wider than gay rights if ashes had been ruled against\nIf if if if the cost and said that they should be compelled to promote a message we disagreed\nYou can imagine a scenario where a Muslim print or could be
