I Want to make one data point here\nThe last time a Republican won this office was Nineteen sixty six that was our ten years before I was born so I mean I don't know whether it's been a\nA very long time and Republicans have feel like they've got a great shot fought mhm our poll showed one thing that that might give Keith awesome some hope that there was plenty of undecided and one in five Democrats listed themselves as undecided in that race\nSo for for them this might have been a wakeup call that this is not a drill and they're really going to have to make a choice and Keith Ellison has been this week trying to make that case bringing up things about his opponent Doug war though and and how conservative e is telling people you might not like me but look at him\nYou know I was going to ask you about that the undecided but in relation to the the the run for governor but real quickly how much of the Kavanaugh hearings on how much did that play into\nUm the ... the poll plummet for Keith Ellison well a lot of\nPeople use that to make the case that if you're going to hold him\n... justice now justice Kavanaugh too high standard Democrat you better hope Keith Ellison too high standard and if you turn on the TV there's a lot of ads for other races for Congress for a you know these these competitive races where Keith Ellison his picture right next to the Democratic opponent so he he's a fixture in more than his own race\nI'm a real quickly in the in the governor's race will those that large percentage of of independence now the governors' races in is an open race because the incumbent governor Mark Dayton is not running for reelection and so you've got congressman Tim Walz and a Republican Hennepin County commissioner Jeff Johnson\nI'm In the in the past you get it from the past election results do you get a sense of where this big chunk of undecided voters might go I think it stands at twelve percent at least in\nOne of the polls you know it's a great question and I wish I knew but but he you know this is a case where there is a Democrat running to succeed a two term Democrat that's never happened in Minnesota where the Democrat has won a the Democrats usually a C a quite a bit of a drop off in Minnesota in these midterm elections\nThis time they nominated Tim Walz who's a congressman from southern Minnesota and his had somewhat of a moderate record so\nThere is a really hoping that he can kind of carry some of those centrist voters who might\nLean a little bit right a Jeff Johnson has run a pretty standard Republican campaign he's echoing the president on somebody's immigration topics and and uh cut government cut taxes and Tim Walz is has not really had to go negative on his opponent yet so he feels like he's in a good spot\nOkay and and and and how long were you and I were talking about Montana a moment ago but you've done a lot of reporting in from Idaho where Medicaid expansion is on the ballot it's a ballot initiative Idaho is a ruby red state\nDancing with an exclusively stationed tour schedule your tour of Houston Public media at Houston Public media dot org slash contact\nFollow us on Facebook ...

before\nSome of you listening lived through the tunnel of Nineteen sixty eight the assassinations of Martin Luther king and Robert Robert F Kennedy and the massive anti war protests and then there was the political turn of Watergate and the question\nIs what lessons did we learn and can we get back on less divided ground here now to talk about where we've banned and where where we are and where we're going is James Fallows national correspondent for the Atlantic and co author with his wife debt Fallows of our town a one hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America\nWelcome James I just want to remind everyone that the question for tonight is what are you personally optimistic that optimistic about college at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nSo James have you ever\nIn all your years of political reporting seen a political climate like this\nUh this you very tactful eight point out it's been a lot of years a same politics in college back in the late Nineteen sixties and so\nI've seen things I haven't seen anything just like this because there's never been anybody just like Donald Trump\nBut there are times in my lifetime when American politics have been I think objectively worse than out in Nineteen sixty six eight we had Martin Luther king and Bobby kennedy be assassinated within the course of a couple of months we had hundreds and hundreds of Americans per week\nDying in Vietnam and you know thousands of Vietnamese when we had dozens of cities with outright\nUm you know all all the way from just from reading age right now ...

Missoula, Montana and Helen Peterson of buzzfeed\nI'm James Fallows is always is always good to listen to\nA he's sort of like that led posted in the middle of a of a hurricane steady in short ... by the way not just the ... would I Would love to get your reactions to to what he had to say and whatever thoughts you had have from what we've been talking about tonight rental start with you\nWill or somebody who works in public radio um I think he was right about sensationalism and commercialization of the media\nSince the advent of cable television um they found that the formula to profit in news was to have shows like cross fire\nAnd now hold channels that are one side or the other side and that does how polarized the country that's not to say that Trump is right about the media echoing what James Fallows said about that\nUm but uh I think it's a port and point to make about media for profit versus media republics of\n... and how long yeah you know I've read on ... and I\nI really love the fact that I was lucky that all of these towns a lot of and smaller mid sized towns and thinking about\nLike what are people actually talking about and thinking about an optimistic about\nAnd I think that most reporters will tell you that when they're actually on the ground talking to people\nNot at political rallies that's how you send in similar that there is a lot that's going on in their communities that they are really excited about and things that they feel like they can change meanwhile what's going on at the federal level feels so distant and gridlocked an impossible\nAnd like there's these two realities that bump up against one another on a daily basis\nI yeah or do they bumped up against each other are they like magnets the opposite sides of magnets where they repel each other I'm always I'm fascinated by this seeming disconnect between the activity inaction on the ground locally and then the other\nUm hold of any kind of ... of action at the federal level\nOh yeah absolutely I think you're right and that's that they repel each other and that's part of that sensation of whiplash is that you'll come from one of those activities like\nYou know the other day I was chateau and some people who were going door to door getting out the vote for the Medicaid expansion initiative in Idaho and like you know no matter what your political inclination no one was rude like they had real conversations\nAnd then you come home and you are you look at your phone and you see what's happening rhetorically and in all other forms on the national level\nAnd it does feel like that that does national conversations make\nThe smaller conversations to more meaningful one's more difficult\nBrian you're on the you're on the air every day five days a week and you had been you've been doing your show\nFor a long a long time so of the three of us are on the show right now you're the one who's got the most experience with just the the mood of the country in the mood of people um even in what people consider the bubble\nThat is that is New York city do you get a sense that the the drama that is the Trump Administration in Washington that it's not even ... even hear it doesn't have any kind of real impact because people are ignoring it\nNo people aren't ignoring A People's lives are affected by it um I don't want to make this out to seem like you know there's just a nation of spectators who were choosing upsides and rooting for the Dodgers are the red Sox in the world series\nPeople's lives were affected black people's lives are affected immigrants lives are affected women's lives are effective\nUm intensely indirectly\nBy the ways that Trump is too much without going into all those ways that everybody knows people feel personally flat and\nUm so I I hear my call is being more inflamed and\nFrankly more afraid I'm Ben and all my years of hosting my show at least you know significant portions of the audience and I think that's very real and can't be ignored\nRyan layer and Helen Petersen we're coming back for ... a a longer discussion about a bunch of other things that have happened in the news today you're listening to America on the line we

are you register or you\nCan have you research the candidates and a lot of times these\nYou know sometimes middle aged people who say things like that to me and my friends I Can't say yes to those questions and a lot of us can and so I think that\nYou know I think people should give us a chance as a demographic and give us a chance and realize that a lot of us they're willing to educate ourselves regardless of you know what side and they fall on\nMolly you are part of that that park land generation that makes me optimistic about the future of our country thank you so much for calling

call\nSure why are you optimistic\nI'm optimistic I'm a therapist by trade and and I I I can tell that America's sheen seasons like this before where there's intense optimism and as a tense disagreement on both sides and\nI think that I'm optimistic about both sides getting serious about each other's pain and I'm not saying that pain is\nYou know shared in certain points on both sides but I think we have to get back to being serious and I think that season is going to come around where something something's gonna happen you know whether it be another recession or you know the

show talking about getting your reactions to what you heard and Helen how about I start with you\nYou know I really think that it's one of those things where you know there's this old study about how people ... perception of how much violence there was in there in the world like in the United states\nIt there was a correlation with how much violence they saw on television on how much violence was depicted in the TV shows they watched and so they just got the sense watching shows is in the late seventies that oh there's violence on the show so that means that there's also violence in my world\nAnd I think that our media diets are not going to go back to the the ... there needs to be a new more good news in the world but I think that the more\nYou know glued we are attacked our phones into these quick\nTake you know like there's just a lot of things that are really suck that are happening and it's hard to have\nThe balance summits that to think about you know not\nPersonal like developments in your personal life developments in your community and your kids live you know things that that either way's paint a more holistic portray it instead of thinking about like oh we're screwed and so I think that there is I've just watched people who are more likely to the staff\nFeel sadder feel you know like a real depression and you know I think that the fears warranted but at the same time there is as this program has emphasized something to be optimistic about\nHere and Brock Obama at the end of his term used to talk about how we are living in the best time and all of human history to be alive\nBut the major metrics of poverty and life expectancy and things like that and if you take a big step back you can say from a progressive point of view or if you put just a little bit of an optimistic spin on it\nThat we have been moving for the last century do an steadily in the direction of social justice\nAnd it's not a straight line hardly a straight line we're in a period of major backlash right now but look where we were in this country in this world a hundred years ago\nA and it is possible that still the arc of\nThe moral arc of history is long but it does been toward justice if we've been to\nI I like to tell people are in in speeches just how wonderful ... this country is and how far we've come and to bring that point home I tell people that you know

to present anymore\nMonica who to that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy\nRound has a lot of ... wife\nMary easy to have a budget surplus when commodity boom and the first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I Would have voted for a little bit I don't I'm hearing us for a long time but if I were in Brazil I Would have voted for a little in the first\nBlack pointing out that he increased welfare benefits an introduced a minimum wage yeah and\nIt was the right thing to do but after\nThe subprime crisis you start seeing a lot of counter cyclical policies that were not sustainable in the long run and by the time that a deal made her lacked you see a reverse off many of the policy that the first term of Lula that little had pursued you start seeing more much more interventionist economy\nAnd when you look at the ... program for these election they just talking about increasing resources for areas like education health which you are very important but ...\n... ... we will talk about that in a bit ... in a bit more details of the moment but I just want to think about this the backdrop to this election you have to president dude I Do the PG president who is embroiled in corruption finds himself in prison his successor July ... recess who was impeached\nSuggests to those are two factors the economy corruption the face of these two leaders that perhaps as as affected this election enormously but what about the other two things that are getting on top of that crime and the conduct to this election crime is an enormous feature present in life and Brazilian concern\nFor the for addressing this topic and I take a step back and with all due respect to Diego I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others it's not working any longer to the the the first one the scandal when the cyclical a corruption came was discovered\nThe the PTA react to the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of the conspiracy against the P. T.\nThen when a before that when the economy started going down they said that they shifted the blame to the external environment so a yearly this is just rhetoric is not working longer just look at the polls I mean people are not buying the story and they won't\nLet me let me throw food then let's talk about how crime and we'll talk about how this election is being conducted how those affecting how Brazilians think about which way tonight\nCrime has become endemic in Brazil the reeds of homicides in Brazil or has reached\nThe fast let's talk about whether this country's democracy is somehow in jeopardy shy about an hour as a former army captain and much of it in a cycle has close ties to the country's current military leadership Brazil lived ... minute tree dictatorship for more than two decades it came to an end though need in Nineteen eighty five\n... ... what do you think uh both in our government would look like would it have militaristic aspect\nCertainly he has had many military advisors or his vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached certain traditional politicians to join his ticket and they ordered refused so\nThe military would certainly have more influence in government he's likely to appoint ministers who are retired military men\nBut the military in the sense of the currently operating armed forces I think at this point they asked to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new adventure pure warmed\nMonica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... security by moving closer to the minute tree\nThe fact that he's a former military that in itself\nFor many people raised flags but you know I think that the military can be very helpful\nIn many areas of ... of you need we need stronger defense or in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take place on the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that Brazil's is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we were getting a lot of the trade of weapons is just huge and and they are little narrative millions tree or is that a role for the police\nOr the borders for the military and I've heard from people from inside the campaign that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the interior of the country which the military has expertise right I'm\nModerate don't is that or is that usual to have the minute you and your boat is would it be welcome do you think in any country to have to admit it tri ... involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presidents in the Amazon and such adopt extend the sort of\nNationalist view of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the voter\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military is on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude two words growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development\nAnd I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or do\nThey think that both so narrow will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet and then I don't see how they can expect to realize this sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor to gather stokes about\n... there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on it just didn't need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many interviews acknowledge that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of undecided edition of the country the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHe's government is clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's already has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team\nThey have a very clear record of being very pro market and fraud ...\nMonica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust read from from from well I Know I've been\nCovering them for eight years I don't know how this things worse than realize this coalition has been put together hastily right and you have different groups\nThat do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues and I think a ... through march through is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic mind side of the military and the liberal routine which has\nGathering around the economist in a previously announced finance minister Paolo gathered let's see how this story on the program an old programs are deliberately vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what we have to judge if there's if you read the two programs right and I think there was a stark contrast between this ... of the quote on the project\nThat's what we go for on the other hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the past whether they're going to be faithful I understand that\nBut clearly that's how the business community in Brazil ... believes as well and you see that in ... just how the stock market and the other behaves when he became a including his lead in the ...\nRemains it remains to be seen markets are my offered by nature\nYou know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving\n... you know today if I can bring us there is there is there a nude\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil but ... days of the world of one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in their lives\n[noise] we have two different very different projects with these two very different approach\nIn one side we have a few of those that are in South as a liberal surrounded by ministry a national is on the other side has a dodge\nWho has a kind of a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage ought to have a friend [noise] so what we have every zoo is is most state\nVersus I stayed that way we intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people having jobs market we spend money and ... the Brazilian economy\nProblems that they don't ... they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank and they compete with the banking system right in front of that is why\nYou have these big fancy with I Know they can get ...\nWhen he called on his ... companies giving loans like very low interest rates\nMorning as an example you said that ah most of my roommates very clear comments actually not for example initially they talk about ... talks about privatization of state owned enterprises and then of course both\nDenaro immediately boats in and say oh yeah yeah yeah privatization bucked knocked\nRetro bras not generations or the electorate Ross Perot says almost on the brink of going for privatization is not going to be halted\nIt's all very conditioned maybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice were known to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just Brazil's development history\nLit hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I wanted to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talked about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minutes dictatorship which is still rule now in the ... followed that the hundreds of people would disappear do killed and many more were detained and tool shed\nAn amnesty law was passed in Nineteen Seventy nine which meant that when they public reckoning on trials about what had happened in those twenty or so years and today the majority of Brazil's votes as is about a hundred and forty seven million of them they didn't live through that but at the regime which came to an end in eighty five\nAnd you documentaries made in ... tells the story of a dictatorship bureau women's president's op how the Suzanne ... is the film's director and she explain more about the tower\n... and that's the idea that they face up on a deck of that it's a thing that\nThe child was a prison during the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWhere hundreds of women were held because they went against the dictatorship they're fighting for democracy prominent women like former president Dilma Rousseff wearing prison that there will also university students\nSociology historian doctors and they ended up that either because they believed in the struggle simply because they were handing\nAnd might be you know and that would be a very very unfortunate thing to happen\nYou know one one a light into a ... at the end of the tone that I just saw today that they he's going to see requested during a he's this huge him to uh put together the debit culture minister into and the environment ministry which um from what I Know it doesn't work in anywhere any part of the world\nSo are there are a lot of moderate people working for ... campaign there quietly working for him [noise]\nUh they're not debating they're not into social media um but there and working for him and my hope is that\nIf he's really I'm committed to creating jobs of the future to foster a tourism in in in Brazil especially ... tourism that he there will be an economic incentive\nTo protect 'em a man in Brazil and um\nAnd and I hope that to happen\nWhere all laid out on top of the time I'm going to move on if if Brazil chooses shy adults now are easy it's embracing some kind of strong arm rule that at face it has become popular in many parts of the wild\nOr is this a more profound change that will change the nature of Brazilian democracy a moderate talks to\nI think Brazil as the recession\nThe corruption investigations have really battled its institutions and for years for decades Brazil\nPoliticians have been modeling alone muddling through each crisis each scandal and now I think finally\nIf somebody steps forward and does this in\nA way that respects the rule of law and shakes up in a way the system yes we could see something like that however\nI really have lots of cautions lots of concerns about it the situation and the most important let's see signs for us to look for is how do the people\nAccept it all things going to be calm when he takes office in early January who are we going to have riots is escalating the violence that Tim Tim to bring the military onto the streets I think that's where we will see if we're going to go faster or slower or just actually have a chance for reform Diego's\nGot any given everything that Brazil's going through the near the strong man simply too powerful the old policy to succeed\nNo actually opinion polls show that is has changed over the last week between October let's start this week uh books that are lost or at a two percent of the voters she's rejection increase by five percent\nAre going from ... to ... to ... percent with similar to dodge if that trend keeps going on Sunday we could see a river a similar to what happened\nIn the last election when Dilma Rousseff was running against a shoe leather Monica Potts who is not lost ...\nYeah I Know I I I mean we know a lot to them and ah [noise] ah we ah we don't know who's going to win elections there is a ... view of NATO but we just you know we can't\nNobody can celebrate in the elections are happy to occur I'm I'm I'm if people are concerned I think there is a lot of reason to be concerned about both on our own government and in fact democracy but I'm equally concerned if not more we don't we in from the uh died\nUm and they are the ones in their own program who say about changing the uh the makeup of the uh superior a I'm a courts and and the change\nIn the past attrition pardon shit that's not true that is not at that age they according to the wider okay are you worried about it and so that probably ...\nWatch and they weren't clearance rates parents it works that\nOkay I just read it says you have also led to UC Brazil's the chat embracing a strongman or if it's just as a temporary change for now is there more profound change at at work ...\nWell that remains to be seen my take is that in a in a symbolic way Brazil is shorter back in the strong man rule but in real life or to run the country is not a one man show Brazil is a federal system has a multi party system has Congress with\nA veto powers has a strong judicial power so if ... tries to test the waters let's put it that way I think she want go very far [noise]\nI just think about that I look forward to I think it says you fast a\nDegas God da de Monica who dominate

um she's looking for us She's looking for customers that's what she told him she has to make what the cost more small I think in the end of the\n... down the line he gets as well I think that there's a lot more people involved and tasting the food so a dish that we might change\nWill take good six months to get ... the restaurant it's not like today ah we've got the whole will stick it on there is none of that not only is it just about the customers it's about getting it right every single time\nIt was very difficult with Indian food because you have to go to the balance right through the spices and the parents here you're introduced spices ... start middle and then so you have to build a practice to get the consistency right down to taste right every time you do it\nAnd when it comes to cooking is high and you'll partners just sick of this at the end of the day when it when it's the weekend when they have a day off and they came to gets in the kitchen O O G Jacque I thought that

suited and unfortunately I'm at the same\nKind of really into cooking for you then now do you think you are less good cook\nI think come a little bit brave a book because then all that all the time to kind of a nice treat when they do it's not like he's in that little time pushing everyone out he knows what he's doing but he had any shelter salon meal [noise]\nSam what do you think about that\nShe always organized the best party for me but the the pet thing like the worst case is that's only happened like every two years because her focus is at the restaurant\nThat was about ... fast and west things about being married to a chef and do you think I'm Tom will agree\nWith very very tight and we it was a relief for me to be with somebody who was as focused on that would cause me incredible lifestyle now having done a lot of hard work\nWe do meet some incredible people and the worst thing is possibly seeing him not have enough\nTime where they feel though I was really really really really hard to make sure that he has so much time with him taken him to the restaurants and eating out on a day time not so he can spend time with ... on the ... so some things you know I don't know we'll just have to say\nNow I think the best thing about the merits were chef best will say will be can cook a pretty good Sunday lunch and I mean only\nFor the worst thing beer by by being married to a chef is probably [noise]\nYou never quite know when I'm going to be there to do it\n[laughter] he's so direct there's no there's no I Know I I don't know if that was really funny is there's no underlying things that told me that that's what it is a lover that's talking\nAbout the incredible lifestyle you have now but it hasn't always been that easy we talked to last about the stress if the long hours and how this affects people but\nFinancially running restaurants is going to be a risky business and just because the restaurant has ... even doesn't mean it's got to be easy to make ends meet does it\nKnow cry Kate\nIs tough but that is still my job I I called sleep without having seen the bank accounts and made sure that the guy got paid and the stuff get paid which is that she would have to do when I get home [noise] it is tough on the margins are really really really tight [noise]\nIt's tough I didn't really know how to tell you how tough\nBut there are a lot of sleepless nights\nMost about the more rock and roll\nSide of all this because chefs and nine to ... really hard if that sort of thing it's really good fun Sam\nShe party really really hard like a one time we were at all and therefore festival in Paris all the chefs came out and then they party until four AM and she lost everything like phone wallet and that's how they party I think they're the most fun people\nThat I've ever met best\nDoes the partying ever get too much I read that you actually stopped drinking even tell them because of the intense snake ... the common read all you know\nVery very frightening good at it or yeah\nUm we used to meet up after he finished work and we'd be out in so how we'd have\nBreakfast at six AM and go back to him to bed about nine in the morning that was all social life early days it's hard cool and he's given samples that added up the minute\nWe have the two stars and book writing making TV shows come would not\nBe able to do all of that and I probably wouldn't have a nice if I did only because we really really did too much of it and ...\nIt's a restaurant for any rock and roll into your life\nOh not me [laughter] I don't like going to the parties don't mean does go but I don't think she can bring them all she fought off after a couple of losses of wine\nIf anyone's listening today and they've got that I on the show I think ... and nice and I think about making that fascinates back would you have any advice for them but you don't get I\nThink very Cassidy it's definitely a different lifestyle I Try really hard to support the gals at the restaurant he see the shaft his Haji\nHe can feel quite alienated at times even the nothing's happened that that is just purely business in time and but it can be incredibly passionate and scientists about life and and love and all of that but just definitely think\n... that's ... what she found find from ...\nFrom the hash tag BBC the chain or a ... at any time is the fate [noise]\nFor me and the

government um they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment\nThat's how many there are a lot more hitting all talk after the news\nThis is the b._b._c. news hello I'm Jonathan eyes on\nShinzo Abe's meeting China's president Xi Jinping in Beijing shortly during the first visit by Japanese head of government to the country in Seventy is speaking off the talks with the Chinese premier Li Keqiang is are they heralded the new era and his country's relations with China Steve McDonald reports\nThe ages of China and Japan and those are the full scale summer since ... eleven but they've put aside political differences following a territorial dispute in the East China sea to talk of the potential benefits of increased cooperation between the world's second and third largest economies\nTalks between Shinzo Abe's ensue Jim pain inside the ... the people the scene is highly symbolic\nThis mating between the Japanese

closer I suspect the fiery language will return\nKris butler reporting\nWorld football's governing body FIFA is considering plans for an expanded version of the club World Cup which it hopes will boost support for the competition in Europe a meeting in Rwanda of these as ruling council will discuss options including one for told them and every four years Richard Conway reports\nThey may not be a Taliban flag flying but everyone will know who is in charge the Taliban may can enforce the rules they collect the taxes they decide how much of a president's the state government can retain is that true or not\nIt's not look there are areas there are districts where there are a ... where Taliban are collecting taxes and they are\nAre benefiting from illegal minds and they are uh are exploiting a in a in the businesses in the areas are from the jungles illegal logging and the likes of criminal activities that they are engaged in\nA but to say that they control those areas is I think a a very big exaggeration yes they can drive fear into people in those areas they can they can get and they they will be able to kidnap and there'll be able to attack people but do they govern those areas I think that there is has to be a distinction between does\nWell forgotten it if you're telling me is it off you will still every\nInch of the country is is it possible to man every inch of the country no do you know but no country does that but to be able to bring the ah the population centers the Afghan population central under control and provide them with security\nIs an effort that we are a than we have that we've been working on and are not working well Lance or even for the areas where there is a there is in security so that we have the support of the people in New solutions to uh to bring stability to those areas and security for the people\nI I understand you know you understand you're working on the challenges and the challenges are real just explained to me if you can because you all the\nPresident's national security advisor as over the last few months explained to me why according to the Pentagon inspector general the civilian death toll in Afghanistan\nHas reached a new record high in recent months the last year why is it the the trajectory is it in the wrong direction and the the most important function of any government that is protecting civilians your government cannot achieve\n... where we are under attack as the space for the insurgents grew smaller and they're not able to launch the kind of attacks they wanted to to take territory in two thousand fourteen after the international security forces the majority of the national security forces left\nAnd they tried to take territory and that has been there a strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics which two attacks in cities in populated areas\nTo bring international pressure and of course pressure on the Afghan government um that said we have been working at protecting public a population centers um you hear of the news of the extraordinary of attacks that happen but you don't hear of all the attacks that have been preventing\nThat we have been preventing our security institutions have been a improving their ... their service system to prevent them and prepare themselves for the changing tactics\nThat he had about an hour later you get a little later by that I I'm\nSo sorry to interrupt ms might have been at it it is difficult with this delay on the line for the more you tell me about the scale of the Taliban's threat\nThe more I get completely confused about what your own government is doing in response for example why is it that you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised\nTo actually deliver security to the Afghan\nAfghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from Nathan forces all from your own Afghan forces unfold Walt because this is all you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see t._v. there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nUh a space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a foreign country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially\nI'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war or our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste\nYes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a it it it takes more\nNow than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nI've come to a service station just a few miles from the border it's in the republic of Ireland commuters and truck has come here to fill up and grab a cup of coffee so let's see what people here making all this fuss about the border [noise]\nHow does the ... you know of or the checks sold them let some more restrictions on the border war without me\nEven if we leave the reason why we chose to check in the same system there is no we\nDon't know what's going to whether we're going to have her business just cuts on not just because it would be so hard to get across in yeah yeah what was going to be taxes are going to be top sort of going to stop at the border\nAsking waiting for the guy from the man from Romania even if I\nHave a portable they going to be a ball\nHas to be with some very very easy like [noise]\nWhen I'm driving alongside the border patrol sites in the ... the u._k. the republic of Ireland and Europe they all agree that the border should stay open\nProblem is they just called in Korea that can be done it is the biggest block to British prime minister Theresa May's Brexit plans\nAt a huge Laurie from people on both sides of the border oh\nCountry motherhood in the republic it's home to Columbia left which produces forklift trucks march in ... ... is managing director\nTwenty five percent of what we produce a shift in the u._k. markets so breaks it as a big eight and\nPut on top of that which is even more major for our company\nFifty eight of her own place to live in Northern Ireland and travel across the border de ... sort of fear if these tools you could not talk to them and I was I think for any of us in the ... that's the last thing any of us want to see the reality is if you have any Cain of checkpoint on the border crossing is going to disrupt flow\nAnd when you disrupt fluid inconvenience and it costs money\nOn the on the phone fell off a guy walking in front of\nMe I have family from\nThe moment it takes probably about thirty minutes from the top of the cost of all parties offensive in a wheel known of it is actually the previous experience of\nWhy I Would definitely be a lot of water every day\nI mean the movie you're saying it to me so yeah\nHe's a big question do you think we could\nSome of them get in on one of these red lines children's yeah\nDefinitely have to stop the war you know ...\nOf the most of the moment are on a half of what he I\nMean they're going to come\nSo what's clear is that any change to the moon and wouldn't be a huge issue for a company like this\nEspecially when you consider that a court of ... to ... [noise]\n\n... really really illustrates the challenges to board a present such a [noise] it's a form that actually struggles ... fields here at the moment I'm In a\nNote on and in the u._k. and the ah there's a little stream of hedge on on the other side I'm just crossing it now on the other side here\nIs the Republican bought and didn't ah the former who runs this lunch is Henry McIlroy\nHow difficult would it be to close this boat or do you think they're cutting Rico's\nYou know yeah you just like the whole thing by talking on a ... and ... but I don't want to stage they're cooking until ... but they're still fuck you want to know quite folks here in fact I'm a\nOn the recording told the situation\nWhen the ... the British troops were I guess I couldn't ...\nPlus he's ... years I've been using the ... what are some some stumbles obese on every\nTime he suffered only getting some ... ... so the u._k. and crossing through the federal ... hat yeah becomes a person's right through into the into the European Community ... on a\nShort drive from the border you know ma brings me to market hill in North and on and so I Wonder what things ... small independent trying to like this\nAre you worried the might be a hard border again but not be appropriate for the shop chasing\nA weak country far worse than not here we had five bombs at her door and businesses here for ... years and to be honest I think Theresa May has Ninety five percent of\nIt started I ate the other side of the shortest she's come say so you know it's afternoon\nNow comes through very clearly from those interviews is how important it is for ... everyone who lives works near the border\nThat it stays open so why is on a divided on why is this division still such a sensitive issue that is what my colleague ... ... Amanda focused and a freelance journalist from Belfast\nIn Northern Ireland\nI didn't because I did indeed teacher sections the republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. so governed by Britain within Northern Ireland are are sort of three sets of people there are people who have the British identity people they have an Irish should end today and then the group in the middle that have a mixture of those identities\nSo the union is that people with the British identity one term in part of the United kingdom whereas the other side won the whole identified in to be one\nNation and not to be governed by Britain so that's what the conflict came into it and not still a cultural war still a political war so the Nineteen Ninety eight Good Friday agreement to peace protest teamed up with scientists given Northern Ireland uh degreed stability prior to that was in decades of conflict ties ...\nMurders and bombs and people were fair to the troubles which doesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland it would have been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day not fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction we knew it was like having to show documents that the idea that you might go back to there being any sort of the it presents or a military presence or anything like that\nAlong the border is if deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of finance returning if there is a pool to reestablish between\nThe Irish republican or the night and it's a real\nThreat I think that it is you know when people talk about I returned to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nThink about the hard border would introduce would bring to all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups so gifted and Republicans and what are most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are carrying that work would become a target than it is that police duty to defend people here are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so\nThe play service here has serious concerns about wants a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view you\nAll that people in the non into it would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know political parties in Northern Ireland devote pursue Asians all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that you know where that can be treated any differently to the rest of the case of in the future if there was any trade data is that the Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the parties have you back so it's sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've cut her head in her hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement on it's not being accepted as\nHow much of a discussion topic is for people on the day to day basis in way you are in Belfast this is something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking by day in day I\nWas ... that has done is put the issue of the constitutional position\nHigh up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the ... the constitutional position whereas now I with Brecht said people here are talking about Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice that will strengthen northern Ireland's union with Britain\nWhereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances\nI certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every TV show every talk show every pulling all by these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel it but\nWho has sent that particular ... whether it was unknown elephant or now and that they didn't day and obviously this is something that needs a lot more steady intensive understanding the sensitivity of the fence I'm really starting to look at how that might change under different noise conditions for example\nWhat ... what about other animal besides the elephants can we use seismic you know to protect them talk to them possibly\nThis technique is going to be best suited for animals that are generated large amounts of force say lodged land mammals it's possible that we can pick up\nThe research that needs to be done is obviously looking at how no any way that we can detect them but whether we can discriminate between say ... or looking at a different ... that ... the next research project that needs a lot more at ...\nSorry or do you ever think there is a geophysicist you'd be involved and tracking elephants\n[laughter] no I mean certainly has an interest in animals have all sorts of sizes ever since being a child like many others\nBut I guess growing into the feel of seismology you sort of realized that the Web rations to happen everywhere in the planet and of course the Trump prevent us from studying any sort of liberation rather than just earthquakes\nSo it's it's a natural trajectory of taking advantage\nOf think that more than a research fellow in neurology and ... so she professor of physics both at the University of Oxford in the u._k. thank you for taking time to be with us today\nThinking thank you You're

ahead you know and it's just gonna say I love that aspect of the book I think that's so important um exactly what you're saying that for that a lot of science that's a kind of coming down from the mountain and again that district that 'cause they're wonderful but with the answers\nAnd really the process of discovery is very very nasty and very exciting that's half the thrill and and as I was saying in the sketches you see this kind of wonderful process of discovery and uh and and getting deeper and better it'll closer to some kind of representation that that you're really looking for\nIt did you said ... did you set out to do with that way or did you wind up saying this is the only way I could do it\n[noise] I'm actually a a boat I Want to say Eighteen years ago um I first had the core idea for the book which was to\nTo have dialogues I really want to ... to be up front I wanted it to be a more that your your your being invited to be part of or at least to a witness conversations about science as\nOpposed to having the news brought to you from on high as it was so that was the core idea and then I thought it would be really engaging a to maybe see\nWho these people who having the conversation and then later on I thought hey it would be fun to see whether having the conversation and then gradually over a number of years um those elements the visual elements became more and more important to me and it wasn't until about um two thousand five two thousand six when I realized oh wait I should just use narrative\nOr art for this and then I realized oh this is a non fiction nonfiction graphic novel um that or I should just I should just make this thing and so that was that was the beginning of the of the final journey of are starting to draw it\nTalking about the the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe with the Clifford or the Johnson and I'm also a a gentle Evan tell you tell us about your nova\nIt was a real experiment and also digital representation and that's a different situation\nNine zero nine zero eight eight seven I'm Dave ... news director here at news is seven this is Houston Public media's fall campaign will it and successfully that is completely up to those of you who have not given yet what is right level of support for you ten dollars twenty dollars\nMaybe thirty dollars a month or they sustain her\nBut I'm In a real difference on this the final friday of the campaign with me today is Elizabeth trouble\nWe are several heartened to see people come together to support an organization that is solely dedicated to keeping greater Houston informed with top shelf reporting called I call donation ... donation\nYou make a place for a fact based journalism is allowed to flourish if your life is better because of news eighty eight seven\nTake a few minutes just show your support this is why your gift matters the critical thing is to help out now because every donation is helping us get closer to our overall goal\nVisit Houston Public media dot org or make a donation right now by calling AAA nine zero nine zero eight seven that's triple eight nine zero nine zero eight eight seven\nWe've been getting calls from all over the Houston area from the woodland or from Galveston Bel Air Cyprus spring just got a cold most recent from Logan in women's thank you so much for for contributing Logan well you know you name it and\nScience friday on the program we're listening to right now has covered it every kind of science imaginable physical size life science earth science even even theoretical computer science\nThere was no the program like science friday that's why you find yourself tuning in week after week and says this is public radio it does not take a rocket scientist to understand the listeners are the most reliable source of funding for this not for profit stations station I Know your rocket scientist we have a lot of here in Houston\nUnderstand that this is why you're give matters a contribution right now is so important\nToday news eighty eight seven is asking you to become a supporter of our mission people tell us they have relied on in that first rate reporting on local issues for years that's what we're here for\nAnd and then the conversation but come back later on and we'd again sort of back off from the fully quantum description this time round by revisiting a lot of these old questions about the nature of space time and quantum physics and what have you with perhaps better tools and better intuition than we've ever had\nAnd those tools include full on descriptions of things like a entanglement from quantum theory and uncertain so full of ... to the point now\nThat they're all toy models that people work on where you actually discover space time as a sort of approximation to an underlying reality which is much more corn to mechanical which is much more about uh entanglements so space time images as a as a sort of\nA derived object from an underlying quantum reality and those sorts of things we're hoping we can build into a full theory of how the world works eventually\n... circus going back to one of the main points I made before because we're we're running a little bit and I'm like we could talk about this forever but\nLet's talk about the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room which is a black hole heavier than than me [laughter] he's he's the black hole ... gonna be the Rosetta Stone for physics [noise]\nYeah I mean I really feel the black hole is the key to providing as evidence it's giving us close all the time and and as we experiment even just in pen and paper on the surface of the black hole\nIt is not joining us ever closer to some revelation and and I think it may be what do you think ... [noise]\nYeah I I I think it ... as I said before it it it it it has this this pool of both both are literally in metro ... which is ... which is interesting in that it showing the ... the concepts of black hole and the the mathematics and physics at the black hole lead you to shows up in so many different areas of theoretical physics um\nAh both directly and indirectly uh and uh that's really interesting to see I think his ... there's an interesting history story that's going to be told about that and um but it's also instructive physically ... Ito astrophysics is the obvious place um [noise]\nUh now an a whole new ... new way because of a colliding black holes giving us gravitational wave signals that we can detect a expanding astrophysics in a huge way\nBut then you come to questions of ah the corner of nature of space time et cetera and again black hole seem to be a central there but then through things like string theory you find that the properties of black holes even abstract properties on the page black holes in strange space times if you work out the mathematics\nSometimes turn out to be powerful ways of re costing other kinds of physics which you can actually dress up to look like the physics of black holes for the sake of doing a useful calculation\nSo black holes are becoming this sort of you bake it just concept and ah even a tool box for doing physics so it is quite a remarkable um idea\nIn case you're just joining us talking with Clifford Johnson author of the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe and we're also talking with a gentleman who is ... you got the nova ... the nova specially the same title of your book black hole blues\nNets black hole apocalypse [laughter] yeah it's the only black hole utopia [laughter]\nI'm black hole blends\nIs actually so named because ... won the Nobel Prize for the light the discovery of the ... black holes along with kept dying day there that could just mentioned um ah gave me the title because he said to me like a month before the discovery if we don't detect flat halls this whole thing's a failure [laughter]\nWell I'm thinking of things we haven't discovered that the whole idea of the theory of everything is that guy is there still possible we talk that's been talked about for decades\nYeah it's gone down that's really still in some sense what what what ... referencing when when we're describing the black hole can do for us it can drive us towards that Syria and everything it will be interesting if it turns out to the theory of everything is supposed to unify the matter forces which is a lecture leak\nAnd strong currently which we think can be unified and gravity gravity is really the outlier know it might be interesting if again is Clifford said it turns out that it's only matter forces and gravity is this illusion that emerges from the quantum phenomena that man it's just something that we see a large scale protests in actually fundamentally exist your\nCountry do you still have a second act the dialogue or another book\nUm I I I uh ... the original book as originally proposed was about four hundred pages long so I I cut out about um a enough for almost a second volume I actually think it would be fun to revisit uh some of the same characters are having other conversations\nBut ... but in terms of the physics which is really the starring character\nI think I Would probably delve even more into the quantum aspects and for him so I Do in this book I I think there's some wonderful things going on as we've already talked about in the ... in the concepts of understanding space time and entanglements and things like that\nThat deserve a visual treatment that they really haven't been given and there's something about the language of a narrative sequential art comics if you like\nThat lends itself to physics more than almost any other form and uh I I I think this is just the beginning of of what one might be able to do so as an experiment I'm curious to get going it just takes a long time\nAnd I can say that I can talent and then it's beautifully written beautifully drawn very well thought out the easy to read makes you think and\nIt's beautiful book great work you like it very much clearer Johnson author of the dialogue this conversation about the nature of the universe he's also professor of physics at the University of Southern California and co director of the\nLA Institute for humanity they want to talk about that some day Yeah John eleven author of black hole blues and she's also professor of physics\nAnd astronomy at Barnard and you can see her nova series can stream it yeah\nAgain giant ... we've been talking with Dana Lebanon separate Johnson about our amazing universe and how to explain it you know each day this station helps to explain your universe and helps you make sense of the world around you but they can't do it without your support so please give them a ...\nAll now here's the number eight\nEight eight nine zero nine zero eight eight seven or if you're at your computer right now go online it's used in public media dot org\nYou're listening to news eighty seven I'm Jay Field a news director here we have all been impressed by the outpouring of support from the community and greater Houston thank you if you've already done your part if you're still haven't had a chance to pitch in on this the final friday\nOnly take three minutes to have a profound effect on daily news coverage that you hear right here on who's eighty seven and it was going today is one of the people that brings you some of the daily news coverage or immigration reporter Elizabeth trouble\nLending a helping hand is something that we do when someone is in need it's just so we are as he ...\nThe need we're talking about today involves all of us they need to find all of the programs here on news eighty eight seven for the coming months others are taking responsibility for a portion of the goal so if you can give a hundred dollars two hundred dollars five hundred dollars or more\nHappy huge help or we hope you will join others who are signing up to
