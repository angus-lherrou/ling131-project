{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "But yesterday they said well you know see the appeal against his conviction but he then announced that he will take the United kingdom to the European Court to begin to his case he expected Duncan Haynes who's director of policy ... national UK\nDreams of bore a was a former governor for eight years of Nigeria's ... province and he was sentenced in the u._k. in twenty twelve for several offenses including the laundering off tens of millions of pounds worth of stolen public funds from Nigeria\nHe lost his case yesterday as him Wednesday lost his that was being described as a non mock appeal against these charges in London but he now apparently has instructed his own loyalist institution appeal against it so can you tell us more about this how does that one\nWay of Transparency International UK role is off the view that his appeal was a merely playing for time seeking to undermine the seriousness of his criminal record\nHe did all through all plead guilty in that trial in twenty twelve\nAnd so any further attempts to a pill this conviction are probably from the very same playbook but um we we don't believe they\nHave much prospect whatsoever but it might provide him with some cover through which to try and a rain gauge and I'm establishing itself on the front line them behind the scenes in Niger and politics\nI mean we know the elections and next February in Nigeria but aside from his political ambitions the fact that this appeal has been overturned are you seeing it as a as a victory all what significance of this case the\nUh this is very good news for the place in the United kingdom a who were being very directly challenged by the uh specifics of his appeal\nUp but I think the thing to remember here is that the extravagant lifestyle or that he was able to enjoy in the United kingdom a was with money that was stolen from the Nigerian people\nAnd uh these uh funds which are old to be recovered now by the police in the United kingdom so that they can be returned\nTo the benefits of over ...\nI mean we're talking about some to the tune of was it not more than sixty million US

excess of two million pound\nAnd a ... may well be wet weather place a stops in that case we think is also very important as the United kingdom a tries to turn its back on the money and to see those that have a salt to a lot of the process of crime and corruption\nAt here in Britain a and there are new powers available to the police now which are being tested uh in the British ... so at the moment we should make it easier to confiscate a unexplained well\nCan you describe some of the ... places because I understand it wasn't just in England\nHe had a a mansion in South Africa as well but it may well be that ah actions will be able to be taken in the United states as a result of\nA this conviction being held a bill this week\nAnd he didn't just have property he had that feats of calls as well and he\nAnd other on a date I think there was an attempt to a process of conviction to to secure a private jet other assets a harder to prevent being moved on ... uh in the same place that were when they purchased\nIndeed they uh that was that Duncan Haynes diet until policy at Transparency International do tell us if you have comments you'd like to share plus four four seven seven

group\nWell the minute she launched to launch scandal ... got cyanide Twinkie Eighteen in February to in the peninsula of I asked you had to sell to an attack on a mosque in the ... and you know which killed more than three hundred people so how much off the track\nIs the uh yes if a man in the Sinai colored Chuck ... who has his just published a study on the good\nWell you know without fear mongering I think it's an incredible threat based on a couple of factors the first is the ability to plot and\nExecute spectacular attacks or if you think back to the Russian airliner that was down using\nA a bomb that was discussed in a soda can clearly the capabilities there I said the other piece to it is the sanctuary and safe haven that's provided by such austere terrain you know these guys have pretty much a free rein to move around the northern China as they please\nAnd then the third critical factor is really the ineptitude of the Egyptian army\nAnd that is the big question because I reach stand Cairo maintains a real best conventional miniature ... that what are they not getting to try and come this\nExactly they are not considering I'm a hearts and minds approach whatsoever or they're not engaging in a parsimonious use of force in fact they are doing just the opposite they're engaging and scorched earth tactics and so they're not attempting to separate the insurgents from the population as we know and classic counterinsurgency\nDoctrine a or best practices so they've ignored all that\nLeslie they've outsourced a portion of the counter insurgency the Israelis who've taken over a in a covert matter um although not covert enough because here we are talking about it a a significant portion of the air power involved and bombing I asked a physician's throughout the

interesting thing Egypt has been said desperate to try and quality and ... the ... yeah that the Syrian Government has he been tend to these rainy but how so more help needed because that's these ratings are providing assistance to power I think that what about the international sad\nYeah so it's a classic Middle East the enemy of my enemy is my friend I'm certainly no love lost between the Egyptians and the Israelis although with cc in power now we've seen kind of warming relations between Cairo in Jerusalem uh I'd say to the extent that other players are involved internationally I'd keep my eye on what Russia does\nAll we know Russia's been quite active in Syria Russia's even taken a more concerned an invested interest in neighboring Libya\nSo to the extent that the Russians get involved whether that's through direct trading were more uh in terms of arms sales to be determined but certainly that you know the kind of cultural heart of the Arab world a lot of other countries

thanks for having me well\nLet's start off with the uh the mess with a Saudi Arabian we have a couple of a sound bite here he is the president who's asked a well you don't have you asked about that audiotape that that the Turks um apparently have showing or a recording the brutal murder in December moment of ...\nWe've asked for it if it exists rises no I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly the uh I'll have a full report on that for my when it comes to\nMind being Mike Pompeo the secretary of state who wins to Riyadh and after a photo op with no smiling handshake so with the with the crown prince\nSaid that um he didn't really want to talk about the specific this is what the secretary of state said when he was asked well you know what did they say about whether democracy hoagie was alive or ... what what happened to him\nI don't want to talk about any of the facts\nThey they didn't want to either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete the investigation or a wife\nI got I think that's I think that's I think that's a reasonable thing to do to give them that opportunity and then we'll all get to judge will all get to evaluate the work that they do\nOkay so Amanda what was the point of that visit by Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia\n[laughter] I mean I think it was to give the appearance that the Trump Administration is taking seriously a but\nIt didn't really come off that way ... ah was shown in photographs they're laughing at me with Saudi officials at the state department spokeswoman was\nUh put up on social media to take care of herself or sightseeing and ... that's not a great luck when you are over there in fact to getting the grizzly death of this journalist and I mean the Trump Administration seems like they are\nRight now looking for any way possible not to implicate the crown prince who has close ties to Jared Kushner for example a but it's becoming increasingly hard because all signs point to Mohammad Solomon crown prince and being involved\nWell there's there's global outrage about this a lot of pressure even from Republicans in Congress to do something about the murder of this Washington Post columnist\nOr Russia North Korea none of our allies right we're we're constantly beeping on getting in Germany or strongman he has a thing for strongman dot dot dot so\nI think this is really upsetting not just journalists but you know certain members are definitely democratic elected officials that even some Republican officials who are finally starting to just wake up just to touch we don't know if they'll you know pull a flake in sort of raise a red flag and then quietly sit down but they're saying is this actually\nDoesn't smell right in the sense that we cannot as a nation\nWe cannot have a journalist going into embassies\nAnd dean brutally murdered that just cannot stand and it can't stand for president to say well we've got a lot of big deals cooking so what are you gonna do he wasn't a citizen that is absolutely not again I think finally they're going to be some people within his own party who say sir I think that this is actually a much larger case\nOn and we might need to put ... finances aside in an address it\nProbably should have a more delicate transition now from from this really serious topic to to do to domestic politics now that we're we're twenty four forty eight hours away and I want to get you know T this up to you or Ben I'm\nHow did how do you evaluate the Elizabeth Warren rolling out of her DNA she seems to be right now under fire from both the left and the right I'm clearly she thought this was a way to counter Donald Trump to prove that she fight how do you evaluate\nThe success or lack of success of the uh of of the war in DNA roll up\nA real mistake on her part I think she thought it would play very differently than it ended up playing\nA statement in particular put out by the Cherokee Nation was was really brutal and and not something that\nI think she could have anticipated frankly I'm surprised but she did it it seemed like a big mistake to me to even engage on that topic\nUm and I don't the Democrats are going to take away a positive development on her part the other thing is\nI think the timing of suspect it doing this before a midterm election when you want the focus to be on any number of different critiques of Republican Party and the administration middle it takes one more news cycle\nAway from I think a lot of things that could be used to increase the number of Democrats in the Senate\nThe number of mistakes that I've seen happen on the on the part of of a was with Warren or the last couple of years does raise some serious questions for me about how effective she will be as a candidate and twenty twenty I think she'll still have a lot of support\n'em but you know she doesn't really telegraph the sense of of necessarily having a a real connection real an awareness of the way that things developing media which is we've seen now becomes an incredibly important aspect of\nWhat people believe qualifies you to become president to\nJoan Joan Walsh what what about that did it backfire on or was it a mistake\nI I think he did backfire I'm ... and that means I guess it is a mistake I mean I'm I'm going to confess I'm somebody who really loved the video when I first thought so\nOr I'm going to stand by as some of that reaction uh I think what I worry about now is that it does seem like she did not adequately that this whole idea with native leaders ah I don't consider the the you know the statement of the Cherokee Nation leader is is is very\nDamning on the other hand the Cherokee Nation has had its own problems on on issues of race and inclusion or trying to kick out the black Cherokees or a few years ago so the but but it just shows you how fraught these issues are when it comes to race or had nothing in order to get a call him quite well I think\nYou know I think what she was trying to do is say look\nAnd leave your mark on the city that helps you achieve their dreams will help you get your ducks in a row for more information coming Courtney land at seven three seven four three eighty four four visit Houston Public media dot org slash ducks\nFollow us on Facebook at Houston Public media and tweet us at Houston Public media\n[noise] I'm Shirley psych skin for Jonathan Capehart tonight and you're listening to America on the line from W N y C and public radio stations across the country I think we're on more than a hundred and fifty stations tonight when they return to the state of Georgia were early voting has begun\nAnd with the race for governor there between Republican Brian Kemp and Democrats Stacey Abrams is making national headlines\nIn front of his reasons if she wins Stacey Abrams would be both the first black governor and the first female governor of Georgia which is not elected a Democrat Tibet office in Twenty years meanwhile as you've probably heard by now\nSecretary of state Brian Kemp the Republican candidate for governor is facing lawsuits and the range of Democrats for initiating new order rules\nThat landed fifty three thousand voter applications in limbo there's another lawsuit against when it county for rejecting an unusually high proportion of absentee ballots in that county has one sixty percent non white\nSort of talk about all of this and more we're back with Joan Walsh national affairs correspondent for the nation and we're also joined by copyright host of W. N. Y. sees United States of anxiety podcast who's just back\nFrom a reporting trip to Georgia thanks for being an American ally thanks for average or well let's talk about this uh Stacey Abrams what makes her different I mean obviously you know on paper for ... ... you know black female governor of the state of Georgia give me some sense of what makes her this distinctive\nWell first black woman to be would be the first by going to be governor of any state in the history the United states uh so you I think you run out of things I could go we go all night on what makes her exceptional I mean there's there's who she is\nBut then there's also what her strategy is is a ... if she wins she will mark a dramatic change in the Democratic party politics for the south\nAnd since twenty Thirteen what we've seen quite predictably is a return to this patchwork of ways of suppressing\nSo we're focused on those fifty three thousand voters in in Georgia but the thing about it is like it's not just those ... the the the ... campaign and and voting rights advocates have right we really focused in on that 'cause it's easy to understand and there is very specific people but there's a whole host of things at play\nThe state of Georgia has closed two hundred and fourteen precincts in the last four years doing for ... years and so when when we talk about clay county would you heard in that clip from Stacey aimed when I talk about the woman who who's who's doesn't have a car and she's trying to get out the vote for\nHer ... places recently been moved used to be down the streets\nAnd now she's got to go another twenty minutes to get to it and so it's there's this patchwork of things that is made voting in Georgia a lot harder\nThan ... now my understanding is of course that these fifty three thousand votes are cast as provisional ballots yes you can show up but if this election turns out to be decided by one or two thousand votes then they go into you know some sort of legal limbo or you know you\nKnow they can't they get counted I mean it's my understanding is they get counted\nBut the problem is that they're vulnerable to challenge right I mean you want the the whole the whole fight here in the voting rights real becomes\nPeople who are trying to expand the opportunity to vote to get ... votes clearly in the bank get this is a vote that it does not have an ...\nAnd all of this sort of concern about voter fraud is about racking up the number of votes to have an asterisk next to them that are going to have to be litigated over and so that if you have a close election like you're going to have most likely in Georgia\nThat there are as many votes as possible uh this is I I Believe this to be true and certainly what the critics of the state would say that there are as many books as possible that you can fight over whether it's a valid or not\nAnd and and and so that's what really stands for these fifty three of those fifty three thousand people absolutely can vote they will receive it they'll they'll they'll receive a a\nI don't know the legal status I'm not going to myself but they'll be able to vote but but the state will\nBe able to challenge or ... is that a voter suppression\nYeah suppression because you're adding an extra hurdle to two people a ... for for a very arbitrary reason end to it to go to ... bigger point in the states that used to be covered by this pre clearance requirement of the voting rights act\nThey had literally kicked millions of beyond Georgia millions of black voters off the rolls since ... twenty fourteen\nThey have literally closed hundreds of polling places in black neighborhoods since twenty\nThirteen and they would not have been able to do that or not they were not if they do they try to join the cake this is the case known as Shelby County versus holders\nThat ... that night and this requirement that if you were a bad actor for you know Ninety plus years we we're going to ask you to submit your new plans for the way you're going to mess with the voter rolls\nTo to the Justice Department and we're going to say oh no that makes sense people have moved moved moved the polling place where there's going to say no we see what you're doing a ... and it it's just no coincidence that all this change has happened and it's affecting black voters only and I don't want to say only in the states but we've documented\nWhat are you going to make them a worst case scenario for you know the village intimacy of a democracy if we start to have these elections that are decided by very very narrow margins in which a large portion of the population believes that there was voter suppression of voter fraud visit that they believe that the system is fundamentally rigged against them\nLook we're coming to ahead and this is where again I uh I think this this particular race is so important in instructive you know because\nYou have two strategies planning out that are gonna that will that will be in conflict for a long time where you have a Democratic Party that if if it switches toward prospect deflect Stacey Abrams that says we're going to explain the span of playing field into these play into these countries in the state that we have normally ignored get new voters out get\nA registered voters who don't vote often out\nOr that have a lot of hurdles in their lives and living in the first place that are trying to expand democracy\nAh and you have a and certainly in the south the Republican Party that has\n... has spent the past decade saying you know the biggest problem with democracy is that people are cheating and there's fraud and so we're gonna try to constrain it and those two things are going to be an absolute conflict and and and and they're going to be in most in conflict in places where you have a majority of voters\nWho are people of color and for Democrats and that's where the ... that's where this is playing out\nIt is but how will play out in in sort of the electoral college states I mean I I mean obviously you know one of the things when I first read it but ... why would why would the Republicans be willing to sustain the kind of political damage spend the kind of political capital on some of this\nHave they just made the calculation that the winning in those states is going to counter whatever the full ... sellout is going to be I\nI think that's right and we've got a media the coverage that you know uh these fifty three thousand a voters critics charge they were they were you know they're they're about their\nApplications are in limbo critics charge the a P ... there's an expose a ... but the rest of the media was reporting it as a he said she said story the media is not sufficiently ... educated about exactly what's happening so Republicans get away with it but when we talk about the electoral college to talk about your home state Charlie\nI Believe it was to something like two hundred thousand or maybe it was three hundred thousand black voters in Milwaukee could not get that I I'd rather we never bought that I ... I you didn't know I\nKnow but but you're speaking of you know talking about turnout you know I'm ... I'm Brock Obama won Wisconsin easily um\nThe right to defer the real difference was that the African American vote for Hillary Clinton was down dramatically and she under performed bronco bound by by forty thousand votes Justin Milwaukee County\nHad they turned out for her in the same a margin or she would have won the state of with our lives for us so it was a new voter id there was a new voter id law since ... it was like do we need to take another break and when we come back political tribalism and the exhausted majority\nYou're listening to America on the line stay tuned\n[noise]\nCivil

in tonight for Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line and he was and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country look you've probably heard the term tribalism to describe are deeply divided political landscape\nAnd most of us would say a reasonably there are two tribes ... the red truck Republican and Democrat or three tribes if you count and independence\nSo what if you were told there were in fact seven tribes but two of them roughly Fifteen Percent of us seemed to control the political dialogue for everybody else\nThat's the finding of a new study of eight thousand Americans that was launched by the nonpartisan organization called more in common\nThey released a fascinating report called hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscape and earlier today I spoke with one of the researchers Daniel Yergin thank you for coming on the show thanks for having ms so\nThe most fascinating part of your study what how you describe the two groups with the most influence tell us about that\nYeah so what we have our two groups that really in total comprise about Fifteen Percent of the American population\nUm on one side you have the progressive activists that eight percent of the population there on the far left hand side on the right hand side you have the devoted conservatives those are also a smaller percentage of the population about six percent\nBut what's interesting is that those two groups despite the fact that they're actually a lot less than what you would have to consider the majority of American population are making the most noise\nAnd that's really what's contributing to our sense of polarization in America today so these are the ... the loud mouth at the end of the bar led right back later said that's it yeah and on social media on Facebook on Twitter all those things citizens who their race education economic status\nYeah so both of them are actually in terms of um socioeconomic status they're actually better off than you might expect so um you know I think there is sometimes this narrative that people in the um\nAs you know as you know Charlie the the fact is that the vast\nMajority of Americans don't engage to the same degree\nThat those who are you know have the have the means and have the interest or do you know it's it's a popular talked about the way that people silo themselves on social media and that's certainly something that happens but the vast majority of people are not involved on social media\nWay that others are and when it comes to the media to consume you and I both know that you know the the ratings that Fox News or CNN and MSNBC get on an average night even put together as a very small portion of the voting electorate\nIt's one of these things that I think is is probably true that the conversation is being directed by those who have you know perhaps the most passionate or or the most extreme views depending on how you look at it but I don't think that that's really the core problem and it's one that I I Wish that the that the study which is interesting had done a little bit more investigating of\nI'm particularly interested in the differences that happens within communities that still have a significant amount of community health to them particularly those\nThat have a healthy involvement in religious faith\nI think there's a difference as a a ramification of secularization in America that we underestimate a little bit which is that back when people had the ability to argue with each other about what they wanted for their town or their community and then had to see each other in a few on a Sunday or on a Saturday\nOn that that actually it was something that I think changed the way that we were able to us talk and speak to each other and view each other as equally\nHuman and value and I think that has that has gone away we've seen these increased problems of of division within communities where we lack of perspective even view the person on the other side is being human let alone citizen\nChristian what do you ... what do you think you're I don't necessarily think that the church is is the case because I mean we we know that studies have always shown is that you know Sunday between ten and twelve and most segregated two hours\nIn America I mean I'm not buying the study I I definitely agree that yes you know um there's hyper partisanship and there's different polarization and obviously you know we've definitely miss counted elections just by looking at Twitter and Facebook to those aren't really realistic so we have lots of people in the polls\nThat we have to remember with George Washington warned us about and Seventeen Ninety six and a farewell address\nAbout this hyper partisanship that we see ourselves in right now but I think you know part of the problem\nWith what's going on right now is that there is a consistent message of both sides it's actually not both

involved\nI think nowadays\nHaving a large political relevance being a certain economic power we cannot shy away anymore we have to say because of our history we have to get involved and that's the process we are and now the problem\nThough is that for decades Germany has fielded a century hollow armed forces on demand poorly equipped an under funded it was Russia's annexation of Crimea that really began to change their minds this is compounded by Donald Trump's arrival in the White House a couple of years later\nWe sent shockwaves through the Atlantic alliance\nA sort of underlying

more difficult to quantify isn't too\nBad so well that's exactly why Twitter has released this information I mean Twitter's released the information so that\nWe get a better idea of what's going on but also so that researchers can actually delve into that and to see how exactly they're working on you know selling to score a online and what effect that pattern only through you know really delving into the data that we're going to be able to figure that out\nTo about some of the ... to each of these trolls\nThese trolls work in a couple of ways first in by seizing on and actually mimicking a

on that Trump really like to hit on about open borders an immigration and basically just showing that Israel and partisanship\nDonald Trump or a big powerful leaders are candidates you had so many millions of twisted photos do a few extra camps really might not much of a difference\nSo political researchers have shown that when you get information from someone who is in your community someone who you trust that has much more of a fact than any other message so because a lot of these accounts were posing as real people you know ... particularly after\nAnother veteran or no military or other evangelical communities even walk communities\nSo repeating the the talking points but making it seem like it's coming from an actual person actually did have an amplified in fact that's actually what one researcher who is working on the issue has found that gets kind of stuff really did make a difference in the election my sense is that\n... many of us the most sophisticated it establishing

spot a troll some trolls pretty easily you know there is no profile picture it's random string of numbers let our letter but that wasn't always the case\nFor me the counts these were accounts posing as real people and a lot of it is not something that you know a casual Twitter user can spot on the naked eye it something that Twitter's algorithms are identifying on the back and\nTwitter is

damaging how many jobs where the cost would actually save the peninsula no that's the folks have known houses modeling and he's been working on this since Nineteen Seventy five Roma focuses on what causes these drugs\nAnd what causes drugs according to Rome is ideas there is a wonderful connection I think between that work because if the economy is going to continue to grow and we're going to do something about climate change\nWe're going to need to do more with less I'm not going to acquire better ideas\nDo you think that these two themselves have to answer to this question's\nRoma wrote a blog post saying that we should be conditions in the optimistic optimistic because we can do something about climate change but conditional optimistic because we actually have to pull a finger out and take action serious action\nWe're gonna have to produce a valuable product we're gonna have to produce them more efficiently with less use of energy and particularly with less use of carbon dioxide now what both men would say is the obvious way to do that\nIs to put a price on carbon dioxide most rate for whites do that is a tax on top and\nIf you do that and everything that you do in the economy that involves carbon dioxide emissions is going to get a bit more expensive and that means there are lots of things that people all through the economy will do to ensure that lesson that happens\nSo that could be anything from a better product designed to changes in human behavior to a cleaner sources of fuel\nSo they both believe that if you tax carbon dioxide that's getting to

the rules if you get the rules right and that credible you've got the right to institutions you can do it all again and China was doing this in his own along the coast but what about an African

regular says why doesn't say no Mauritania contract out a little bit of swamp to Canada and say Canada we run this first place is not what if anything to us but it might be worth something if Canada set up all the rules\nAnd then anyone in Mauritania could immigrate to little chunk of Canada Canada rooms rules it's not colonialism because no one has to go there is no compulsion and then maybe we

sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamb\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and
