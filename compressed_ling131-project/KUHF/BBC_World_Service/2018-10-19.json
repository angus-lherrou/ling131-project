and even possibly more countries than that\nBut I'm new reports are merging all the time so I'm you know we don't have very good estimates at the time about prevalence for instance just because it's a widely staying with stigmatized exam but um are thought is that it's probably either and more than the twenty countries that have been documented\nIt's quite amazing well if you say that more people

everywhere there's that but for had politics not good for him I Would be the headline there's one for insurance I Would add this amount standing in a back when you have that level\nBut you're going to

heart if the judge is huge\nAnd has a lot of the things that doesn't mean that he doesn't know any closer to your blood I Would say that the average age they let it outside show those things have changed a lot of those things have been commercialized and not not so much ... like a lot of people\nThere's no doubt that the economy of one of the world's largest city a lot of it has actually decreased around this particular religious festival when go to the guard is basically triumphed over evil if I Walk outside once again I can see that it'll who stole say when you're so most of us and

putting these necklaces and they can generate a lot of money is that money not then pumped back into the community\nAnd sometimes it is but sometimes it goes into the the the companies that are that are beginning to put this up and I think the problem is is the scale of this has become much bigger than what with the stick but you know food gentle push initially with something that was done in the house with families would get together to build an idle maybe build a much smaller\nSample but this has moved on to a different scale and religion in\nBusiness here in India was business as politics got an election coming up it's going to be a crucial part\nThat as well and I think what we're saying when they'll go through to him in Kolkata is a reflection of but much bigger trend that is taking

and all that that was very important part of all is said just become much less\nThan a hundred off your back your heart or people who works for an individual but it's not the profile of rich people

losing by five to listen to them I think there's always\nAll of this generational gap here\nDo think that some of the older people having all kind of like this is not what it used to be on the festival shouldn't be all about but when you don't see young people here for what they want they say look we love it will go from one different sample doing although we've not that different themes\nAnd just pick up some things too much and I found some things have been more lenient than it used to be\nThat doesn't mean that we don't understand that spirit ... aspect to it that it's not

the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nEvery Monday through Thursday we bring you the latest political developments issues and analysis and we hear from you tonight we're focusing on voting who will who won't and who can't\nBecause of new voting rights regulations that make it almost impossible\nWill get into that in a minute but speaking of impossible it may be impossible to imagine a more bizarre scene than what occurred today at the White House press corps was brought into the oval office to listen to a ten minute monologue\nFrom Kanye West joining me now from the ... from Washington to talk about the event and more consequential news is Washington Post reporter Eugene Scott\nEugene thank you very much for being on America on the line thanks for having me\nSo I Want to start with a serious news and that is\nUm the latest on our colleague Jamal ... is there anything new beyond what our paper the Washington Post reported yesterday in terms of um this being a direct action called by the crown prince [noise]\nYeah we're looking at a Congress right now a senator some particular both sides are looking into ways to force a vote that could scrap us arms sales to Saudi Arabia or out of frustration about the disappearance\nOf ... and so we could see some changes happening verify naturally\nA which is where the Saudi Government has you know been used to being at most and could lead them to be more forthcoming about what happened\nThe president was asked about I'm Jamal 'cause she'll get let's hear what he had to say about the global opinions writer\nThe best of our knowledge to show he is not a United States citizens is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we don't like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit\nBut as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives\nThat would not be acceptable today\nSo it sounds like we're we're hearing that Congress is stepping up in trying to be a check on the executive in this regard is anyone talking about the fact that the leader of the free world is not taking a stand\nOn freedom of the press which the United states\nHas always been a beacon of light um when it comes to that in standing up for democracy\nYou do not especially but we should not be surprised considering ah their track record our president has had when it comes to respecting the press um [noise]\nHe has not been one who has consistently or advocated for journalists being able to hold their governments accountable or even you know dealing with American citizens and as as you saw as you heard in that\nThe headline I have is Indiana purged twenty thousand voters using a Chris Kovacs cross check system which I Want to ask you about a moment but the number is up to four hundred something thousand people have been purged from the voter rolls in Indiana\nI'm casino or or or Michael talked about this this interstate cross checks system that is the brainchild of Crisco back and\nFor listeners who may not know Kris Kobach was um secretary of state of Kansas and who was the one who Helmand than the now inoperable a voter fraud commission task force that President Trump um impaneled and then disbanded\nWhen he came into office right well I think you know what Michael is reminding us that you know we're still voting without the full protection the voting rights act\nAnd you know we saw this than twenty sixteen and we're going to see it again and twenty teens so that is a great concern\nI think what's going on Indiana and places like Georgia which is really troubling is that you know when we said just a dash is out of place and it can get your name is completely\nUnexpected from the rolls that also disproportionately affects Latino voters who may have a hyphenated laughing\nSo if that hype and is not there and so there's a gap between the name then that person as it is expunged many people don't know that they're even expunged and so when they do go to vote\nThis type of a discouragement can also turned into a form of voter intimidation which we often times the ... in the south if we remember at brand kept also has a campaign ad with him you know rounding at my truck for him to round up all night\nAnd we quote unquote legal um I don't like the term uh but we've also heard stories from twenty sixteen about people down to the polls armed that will also discourage people so we have some institutional factors as an ex turnout ... that will disproportionately affect someone and let's also remember when Stacey Abrams\nWorked for the non profit news on the worked with the nonprofit the New Georgia project they registered over two hundred thousand Georgians over say the past decade or so\nFrank is well aware of that and he he knows that he can't win it outright and says he has to make sure he takes people out of the race because things have been traveling the state of Georgia and not just Atlanta and that just making in the big cities to really make her case not just a black Georgians 'cause they're not enough\nBuilding eligible black Georgian but to poor people middle class people upper class folks all throughout the state and her message is resonating and that is why can't is is really moving forward that this pretty aggressive agenda too expensive people from the squirrels\nAnd it's worth noting that Kris Kobach who orchestrated the system called cross check where uh it's it's supposedly says oh we think this person might be they properly registered and it's full of errors and ... states have pulled out of it because of that Kris Kobach like camp is running for governor he is both the referee\nAnd the player and co back is a notorious as a hobby almost he he went around the country are trying to pass anti immigrant was\nHe's been pedaling the false idea that there's massive widespread voter fraud in the United states and therefore we need to restrict the right to vote\nIn the commission that he orchestrated blew up the ... the White House commission or you the members of the commission began suing each other and it's if it's found no evidence of widespread fraud and even in his home state of of Kansas\nThere was a lawsuit challenging his purge practices and the judge ruled against him and ordered him to go back to a lawyer school to get remedial legal education because he had so botched this and uh it was quite an extraordinary rebuke of of\nIn our community

my eleven years in the nation's capital\nAnd as everyone knows it was born out of gun violence prevention or was that was the the cause but it's become an even bigger than that and what are you working on now what's been the focus\nSee Ryan up a well ... the the focus so far has has\nDefinitely shift towards as as you know the midterm election is coming on November sex and we are preparing

one is you know there's there's a series of different issues that affect the state of Florida especially young people the the um person bring me to the polls\nAre you focus on the on the gubernatorial race signed for ... um ... current governor ridge\nUh about food I think that it's critically important that we elect go I'm I'm a change the policies that are being propelled by the former ministry

for that max thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nAnd thank you\nSo the lenient Ryan ... I mean that that's a lot of engagement of of young people that we've just heard from very knowledgeable about the races in their particular states in their communities but as you traveled around the country this summer\nI'm ... how much apathy did you run into among young people [noise]\nI mean the people that we thought too much emphasis on loans that mean that was already has those are the people they care enough to to be out there and I think that a lot of them did actually shipped air opinions from one of apathetic on as carrying the ones that we talk you out and say oh\nWell I didn't really care about voting on politics before that but something about this just drew a connection and that's why it every day and that's horrible south\nI I'd seen ten year olds who could talk circles around over half of Congress\nLike young young\nPeople I don't think it's just a matter of making it absolutely important it's easy for them to vote I Know a lot of schools have been putting measures and making it harder for college students to be able to turn in their ballots\nI Know in the state of Florida if you want to turn on that since the ... the cigarette sure you have to give is I'd have to be identical\nTo your driver's license and I don't have that I don't know many young people who are able to copy their signature almost exactly and my just look rules like that simplified next

confirmation or how they flip the script on this how does it become a story about mob rule smear tactics and\nAnd the and the smearing of of an innocent man well Christine Blasey Ford who everybody said was credible and compelling when she was testified has really just disappeared as a factor I mean it is\nBeing a couple of weeks and that almost seems to be invisible so I mean is this is this how Republicans win the battle is no more I I Know you may have a different perspective on all of this\n[noise] yes I um I actually think this was ... on the part of the Democrats um they piled on too much\nThey embraced um implausible and even outlandish accusations along with a serious accusation that his forwards\nAnd by so doing they diluted the strength of her accusation and they allowed I'm

example when African Americans are being discriminated against and how do we argue about that the majority population and one of the answer is\nYou claim to care about universal principles you claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian time beyond we have something in common as Americans and that is the right way I think ... ...\nBy off for an ad on piled high density politics that I was given black lives matter and I showed it to you from the accepts that we just listen to that black lives matter will not say we are different\nI ... well the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy and then the economy that is actually open tools to the point about identity politics as very exclusive ways a sense of belonging that everyone can shatter needs to redo the\nThing I just went through in a can I throw in a different element or if this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say at the civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that what we're grappling with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is an American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't ...\nYourself as a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character of the conversation that's being had on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous in Norwalk\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth\nTo white identity politics\nIs it to them enough ... that actually is destructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there is a fending off it has one that has been set up by the majority this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and set protests\nI'm all in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim narratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your loss of privilege as outrageous\nSo is that rather than putting pointed and how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing by abstract things that didn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBy the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ... if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would just simply not recognized as vets exactly\nIn fact what the beauty movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what type of sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but it is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like last summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big thick\nA very nice movie which is what about graphical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a wide them out and go into sort of dramatic life story they have\nNo spot is um I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us have to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left\nBut some of food that was problematic exercise leave for me\nIs the crux of a disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation says I needed a picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably not very identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics until it kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nLight all I Want to bring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ...\nWell I think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation in identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nWell I think the um Trump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to\nA identity politics and if it's in a reaction against it the shrill know that I observed earlier\nIs alienating to the majority and it's I I I saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the\nProportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims of discrimination in the United states is shockingly high and of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous\nBut it's you know that's what they feel and it's partly the results of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against\nAnd um they look at what is often a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomenon as only coming from this small campus movement but it hasn't helped\nAnd this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely infected the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's a couple of things to say I'm really struck by the way of saying what she does in fact a sudden form of white identity politics um that brought Trump to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority but the majority is playing\nA is being made to play a role that identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how facts maps and help the truth matters and how fake news has a problem\nSuddenly feeling the hurt feelings of the majority of become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what else feelings if I\nFeel that there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the staff affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people\nNowhere near proportional into academia for instance I feel\nAffirmative action is upsetting but it does that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality where the facts what is the truth well on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really say it's just a city as river sexism\nThe point is that racism and sexism are about palace tucked okay so you can't really punch up well it's you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally\nYeah Sherman races so a few points you're first of all unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and then the moxie if you have to ... somewhat about the feelings of the majority because otherwise the booth with people like Donald Trump and but as a disaster for everybody especially for the most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together as a society and help us fight discrimination rather than ... and so the reason to have a feeling of people is that in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a political\nAdvisor Caitlin facts we can't do we talk to and ... and the name all feel\nA little hard and Frank I'm Talking about in countries like the other thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think it's up to ...\n... did you find a counter that we have different kinds of I didn't know what I Would say that well actually I did not do it for what he does in my mouth so I didn't finish by bringing about Trump precisely shows what's the problem is with conception of politics but says we're going to fight for our group and for our side or\nWe don't care about anything else Priya\nSo we shouldn't have a son of action because that upsets white people for the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised groups fair access to writes in order that the majority and not be hooked\nUp outside but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including vast majority of people of color and the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on behalf of cancer and\nI wanted to move away from that point and bring you in Adrian we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system\nIs that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies actually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like\nThem I mean it's a big ah issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites do you stop the Sherman simply on representative\nThat often very smooth any groups and yes often watching the groups within groups which actually bend bring about the system is unjust almost a father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot majorities in since wide working class a population\nAnd in certain countries I've simply not be the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all that kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um I thought that the W. W. see either white ... a very interesting construct\nCan cut off as as a whole have not done ... and the working class as as a whole on not white they ain't too white people but they're all working classes who have been at the shop end of ... near liberalism of capitalism\nHe's pressed their ... because they're working class not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white looking to us it was out doing disproportionately bat as compared to let us say the Latino all black working\nClass which is an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in Bavaria what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller that policy than it had been hemorrhage fights the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant ask the on the other\nMeanwhile the S. P. D. which is the left a sense of ...\nIt seems to lose his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant or you know I'm a lifetime working class I'm ... I Do feel happy and his biggest base people pushing themselves into\nWell I think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working tops have suffered an often suffer more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who reached to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much as last semester father does not like that I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're able to be most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not that was approaching ... rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe ... we have people embedded in relationships institutions lessons feelings do methane in his face or the longing and if they were going to a place to people to communities and countries might just be kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning so who onto wet and these parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it was six if you'll\nNever end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India\nIt winds foods well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nHigher because the votes you they will be very difficult there'll be contested\nBut we Tom somehow pretend that is a world without hierarchy the world without power without differences in well in stages and problem is when when small groups often it leads the pasta older leads new classes or new groups come on the block and simply want to claim the hockey for themselves [noise]\nBother what we should have is a ... actually works Ron roles talents vacations and actually give everyone a sense of dignity which hasn't been\nAn ... what a recognition markings held analytical shares kind of a liberal fundamentalism that we will always have hierarchy and what matters is what kind of hierarchy we have\nI you know I'm all for the human imagination and the human imagination has many times through history and in many places and they shouldn't ... without hierarchy what people are in fact able to be at once individual\nAnd part of the collective good so I actually don't buy a we talked about you know the extreme left\nIn the extreme right we need to talk about the extreme sent to an extreme liberalism as well you know these are the banal ideas about hierarchy and tribalism and this is the way that human beings are and always will be I don't think that if the case I think human beings evolved I\nThink the imagination involves second political imaginations changed\nHave no real idea what that meant but um no I Know a kitty I'm ... I Want to go back to what kind of society we should envisage and and imagine I'm under question you asked about whether it will ever be possible to get away from your identity entirely\nI'm for liberal democracy which means but um for society where people have a a great amount of freedom in fashioning on life and that means that some people will do you identify with the groups of from and say\nI was born a religious Muslim and I want to be able to not just not be white but ah where for example the headscarf and be accepted as a full member of the society and treated a with equal dignity and respect\nBut very much leave within my comment um sense of my life around ... percent of my life around those kinds of things at the same time I also think I Want to live in a society in which the same person can grow up and make the choice about where to come from the time to come from this can kind of religion is not an old important to them\nAnd they don't want that to play a very large role in the lives at all\nAnd at the moment I think the vision that society which has his double freedom is ... it's ... from the radical right it's ... some people are like Donald Trump who want to discriminate you don't want to recognize people have different skin color and then the thesis equal but it's also fun from people who say\nEverything is identity everything's going to be your top national belonging and there's no getting away from that Asian is that how you use it a a a democracy that threaten from the radical right on the radical left\nAlmost certainly as it is also threatened by that kind of a hype liberalism that says that we're just all ruthless isolates individuals or nothing in common with anyone else so we we want to I think generally lemonade older as extremes and get back to the conversation about belonging about the things that we haven't come and his workers\nAs men and women and people of other you know orientation\nAs people leaving the same places as citizens I think it's that conversation about blowing that matches rather than you know keep on emphasizing all the differences and saying that somehow\nWe can imagine some sort of utopia without no distinctions all or you know differences in in in roles whatsoever I'm according for liberal extremism whatsoever that itself as the ... ... what I'm calling for as a society that recognizes people for the different roles and talents implications\nEnded affords public you know dignity to everyone and dignity means being respected fool the sorts of rules you play for the relationships you have not being forced into warm identity oh into just being a a nice lesson vigil\nFree of very briefly ... is that the world you're championing a hyper liberal one where everybody goes back into that separate identities\nHotly I don't think anything on sets today has tended in that direction and in fact I've I've no idea who these mystical people are who've been claiming this I think what we need to be looking at quite simply it's who has wealth and power and who is in fact inflicting suffering and\nExploitation on other people and focus on that and ask the real questions instead of having a false debate about how people who want to be able to use women's boxing them let's say are uh you know a responsible for the rise of racism I think that's just a\nA really kind of a surreal discussion that we have sometimes at the expense of looking at actuality it's no Shriver\nWell as a novelist and they'd person\nUm I get concerned that the identity politics in much like that just that last comment is now trapping us into a world where we think all that matters is human hierarchy that that's the only conversation we ever have identity politics has been very concerned of course with\nWho's privileged who's on top who's been more disadvantage\n... you know life and the world are bigger than that and I don't want to live in that in that space I Want to be able to talk about architecture and all that so\nThat's it for this week on the real story Lionel Shriver\n...

better in a fight to fit ready ready to talk of the will to gain thank you so how far are you running up to an eastern again\nSo in Afghanistan I run that twenty six point two miles a full month and I think\nProbably the big challenge was that it was slightly different than most more than the because it was a eleven thousand feet up I'll shoot it was in the mountains of central Afghanistan which I made it quite difficult from silver breathing oxygen perspective or the ... center at the fight them but I I imagine\nMost of the risk assessment did you need to sign off in order to run the Muslim

and there was one from friends that was one from the U.S and\nPrimarily runners and the what was perhaps the most incredible thing about the importance of Afghanistan was that for\nFor one day and for twenty six point two miles both men and women regardless of gender or social status class at background everybody was support and everybody and everybody runs together and and you know the sun's out big message for me when I when I think of Afghanistan over the last ten Fifteen Years\nAnd so our differences that from the Iraqi ... both of which was also done\nAnd it was it was very different um I I think I'm the only three ... three rooms brought their own challenges whether that was from security whether it was some environmental factors whether it was the heat and both at the same time all three things at odd similarities as well because\nIt was like anywhere in the world I think most people when you visit the country whether the U.S as a soldier or civilian you you're always push by the people you may end for me the project was about children and helping them access to education and all three of these countries are incredible stories of humanity\nThat incredible people and it was an absolute pleasure to to go back to me I was I felt so welcomed in all three of these countries in\nYou know oh ... wheels spin from the western media that these are countries that we shouldn't go to that we should stay away from me too dangerous boy I can sit and they say that my experience that was as good as any holiday I've been on the west\nYou know how does being a soldier um was subdued Iraq can be ... for the British forces how does that prepares you for running a mile from in places like um of context on Somalia Iraq\nI think that as a former soldier you know your fingers you used to operating in hostile environment so you're not naive to the crops the security risks and the dangers\nAnd as a soldier was well you're expected to be physically fit and you also up or you know originally a mindset you know you you know that there's going to be challenges and it's about how you money to deal with those challenges which which ultimately might as most than\nHaving traveled the world as a soldier met most people it taught me to respect everybody regardless of whether they come from me to respect that religion that culture and I think you know in all three of these countries I I did my best to\nUh to respect the people in in in ... the people respected me and I think that goes but anyway you go in the world if you show respect you will get respect and you know those countries and do different well\nNext briefly\nAnd I'm so next next year I'm going to be rowing dangerously or I'm going to be a will for ... but I'm going to row across the ... strikes which is the

ultimately everybody did the right thing and we're thrilled that the empty space is now filled with this amazing monuments and we'll just truly grateful to those who helped\nIt recover it negates the eight and ... and it's right for face\nI contacted the auction house at the request of the church I negotiated with the possess or the dealer and several dealers behind him aware they got the peace and how to get it back to the church\nThat's Chris Marion hello one of the people who played a key role in tending the stolen sculpture to St ... London He's the CEO of a recovery international demand to cool when up what goes missing he's even been dubbed the shuttle combs of off looted by the Nazis\nWith a lot of arm twisting and a little bit of threatening litigation we managed to convince to possess or to voluntarily give it back\nTo the church I can imagine that the people you who's on you're twisting a very very reluctant that's right I mean do they know most of the time that they are in possession of stolen all knew it was dodgy okay they claimed that they bought the piece from\nA you Cade dealer who was specializing in sculpture when in fact we discovered that this dealer was actually arrested for smuggling cocaine inside of sculptures\nAnd it was the threat of a BBC story they were covering it at the time\nThat convinced this dealer to relinquish the sculpture but it's it's a significant loss presumably if money on the deal is signed well you know what money really didn't change hands they traded things amongst themselves to get the peace suck to her value of about fifty thousand pounds\nWhich is what they demanded before they voluntarily\nRelease the work but we refuse to pay them I Try to beat them down with the law and morality to return the object without demanding\nSome sort of payments on what works best a mixture of vote independent who you're dealing with I mean I've dealt with some pretty feisty people where the only resort is going to the court system\nBut that's always a last resort why is it was the last resort because it's expensive time consuming embarrassing to the dealers to collectors that to their name becomes public and\nThere are a lot of judges that don't know a ... from their album so it's something we try to avoid\nAnd when you say you twist I'm [laughter] I'm just trying to imagine that kind of conversation how that works where the art world fixers people come to us and say look I've got something that I Know it was stolen I don't want to be arrested I I don't I'm my name in the paper I Want to cooperate and get rid of it can you help me\nAnd we are asked to keep things out of the press in exchange for cooperation which is something we can offer to go to the press is one of your ways of armed I hate to say that we use it as a weapon sometimes name and shame they have slowly I mean there are people who are well heeled individuals for bold faced names\nThat have stolen and looted works of art in their collections and they do not want to be ...\nThat must be loads of pieces out that that you would like to see ... to ... ... ... well I represent the heirs of the dealer Paul Rosenberg who's gallery was looted by Herman Gehring himself in Paris in Nineteen forty there are over sixty\nTop paintings missing\nSince Nineteen forty and I know where some of them are I Know where one of them is right now in Switzerland and there's a very uncooperative dealer in Hamburg I Would like to get back piece back\nSo in that particular case why is that dealer refusing to cooperate why have your threats not speaking while he sold it to his client so he knows he's on the hook for the money if his client has to give up the painting he's going to have to reimburse a significant amount of money that's why he doesn't want to cooperate it's all about greed it's all about money\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Nazi looted works of art still out there in the marketplace perhaps six seven hundred thousand objects and not all top ... but you know tourists roles and other important religious objects that are just gone\nSo is the art well do you think doing enough to stop this or you can find a lot of people coming here and praise the big auction houses are free to criticize them because they are so powerful but I'm not one of those people the major auction houses maintain\nRestitution departments to make sure\nThat Nazi looted works of art are researched and then funneled through the auction house so that they can earn commissions on sale the auction houses help facilitate deals between victims and possesses of Nazi looted works of art so that they can sell it through the auction house so they've got a vested interest do\nChris Marietta that may be but the auction house Christie's did help Sylvie ... Sylvia describes itself as just a French woman living somewhere in the south\nFrom her grandfather though was Alfred wind the guy\nA prominent ... to ... will perish in fact he was such a respected authority that during the war the Nazi general home uncovering wanted to employ Mr Weinberg to verify the off with heat looted Weinberger refused and so the Nazis pills that his odd collection too\nBut last month off to Seventy is a painting from his collection two women in a garden Byron wall was finally returned Sylvie Christie's in New York\nThe ... you know say that the ... and that's where the Nazis told them most of them were found after the war that we're still she paintings missing five hundred law including the one I received back in New York\nWere you aware that this one particular painting had been missing all alone\nNo never I never heard about this story\nThe war was a taboo subject I suppose that's when my grandfather died you would never expect we could find his painting so long afterwards and he died I was Fifteen so I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things after my mother died now I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that\nThere were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... what did I missed me quite a shocking revelation [laughter] yes it was a huge shock and awe after a few weeks\nI've been told that there should be I was investigating on the property of the painting and the American government decided that it's your painting so they're going to give it back to you so I was a yes\nYou did not know that it belonged to you I mean I haven't made you more curious to go and look at water the looted property there is that belong to a grandfather\nWhat we know actually above the five other paintings\nBut I've got an everyday life and honestly I'm not leaving with that kind of idea I think I'm already been very lucky to get one back but you can't do it when you you can't keep this particular painting unfortunately not\nBecause the French government compensated for the paintings so as I have a back I have to give the government the money back which means you how to ... to raise the money to do that exactly yes yes\nDistributions of birds are changing for example to black vulture used to be a bird that was always in the south and never really got that far north\nAnd now more and more we're seeing those in bird strikes from northern states and so over time or distributions change we don't know why or what the cause of it but we can just see those kinds of things in our data\nJust anybody ever send you stuff they may have a bird unit once an identification of what you know maybe it's an animal swallowed it or something like\nThat yes we worked on a project in fact we're still involved in it with\nThe Everglades national park biologist on identifying the prey remains of the Burmese python there non native species and they're eating birds and of course you know once you get the stomach contents of a Burmese python it's not going to be\nPolite thing you want to see in the morning but [laughter] but uh the\nThe snake DNA will overtake the sample and so it's very difficult to get DNA from material like that so we're using the morphological characters of the bones and the feathers and the other microscopic characters up the feathers to help us determine the species that they're eating\nDo get a call from an airport let's say like JFK which has a lot of stuff and so we don't know what this is but it it may be heading it may be for you because we found other bird stuff\nTo you it up yeah they they definitely give us a heads up especially if they're sending something priority that has caused damage or something that they would really like to know about JFK is very good about reporting bird strikes\nCertainly living in the neighborhood yeah ... is a sanctuary to take a doctor do you think you start to Carla dove program manager of the feather identification my bet you never knew they had one until today at the Smithsonian Institution here in Washington\nI'm guessing you probably never thought about avian forensics or the challenges of identifying and ex bird if programs like this have shown you something new picking you someplace you might not have gone otherwise show us your appreciation

this divided country is objective truth free from undue influence influences and motives year after year NPR and PBS rink highest in trust for broadcast journalism\nWow yeah so the pollinating row really highly unappreciated in unknown and\nYeah I mean we're beginning to look at it now there's lots of studies and all of us live looking at pollinate says but it's just we ... so we see thousands of flights flying around blondes but no one pays attention 'cause I Know the peace with probably massively underwrite the what's going on with it\nThough I I Know that over the years we've talked about some a very famous plants that when they ah they bloom they smell really like rotting meat and I didn't really understand that reason and you talk about it in the book is that this is what attracts supplies\nYeah and I've now sampled off one of those ... and I love that habitat to my life and they really do stink and the thing is that they ...\nIn the flies that like corpses rotting bodies except for the decomposing flies\nAnd these things are getting as in the end that tracked pin them inside them to cover them with pollen till they're ready to be released again and they will go and find another decomposing smelling ... ... yeah well\nYou know I I didn't realize until I read the book also that uh mosquitoes are part of the wife and more\nI realized that I failed all we have found is that my mom lost me that's when she read but I think we're like mosquitoes of flights and it was like well what did you think they were\nWaiting\nAnd I think that's not all prominently side is that no one does think about it I mean we belly thinking of them as animals and that's the whole thing yeah I mean crane flies I hate the common name because it means three different things\nBut the flying daddy long legs foods are flies oh you mentioned that flies at their old that hundreds of thousands of flights species out there\nSo they really make up a large part of the animal kingdom\nEast I'm off the topic for um of insects than there in that with the beats who's the boss of flies the bees and wants to send the lines so and then when we start ... them thanks to new genetic ways of looking at a species I think we're going to have a bit of a shock to actually realize how many species of flies out but\nNow they are also lots of predatory\nChecks to than my baby's love them there's um there's a great by obviously a door and the rubber flies and again this is something we didn't think about science being venomous\nTo everyone thinks that the bees and the wasps in the end and it's like most of the practices in the ... and things like mosquitoes are actually inject a little bit to the venom\nI'm One of those groups is the role the flies on any you quote him aside in science\nAnd these are some of the top ... and ... in fact there's a there's a sense of species in Southern California that has been shown to catch humming butts on the way we should just sit in the idea of these like solve a flight coming along\nThat somebody watching this tiny pretty to humming but he's come along it's cool to hunting but its power lives there and they shredded it completely quite fantastic\nThis was one on one is or is it a whole group of fly\nNow one on one and I'm we bomb in the collection they've called dragon flies they can pay off such good Arab predators and they can say it's terrible I shouldn't they can do is quite by damage to hide the bees et cetera because it just felt that flies\nWell and there are parasitic flies [noise] ...\nYeah that that some amazing into an appetite parasites and just see adaptation these flies and how to get sued to live in the house that they do in the east\nAnd you make that point in the book is that the during the life of a ... it's really the larvae that door most of the damage when there are very hungry\nAnd whatnot that that they have gotten no other function basically ... from tweet say that organs if they've gotten a ... and ... basically no mechanism for movement they are purely just that to eat and some of them was survivor like up to ... just eat\nEr and they might live inside another animal during the\n... and ... parents to take a group of flies cool the Akron Saratoga hunchback flies I Need to live in the insides of spiders and the estimates of spiders\nAnd an evening again to explain that it's too immature 'cause it's fine it's going to gain live up to five years well they would do if there were some of the less falling slogans and the basically just go to sleep for a couple of years and wake up when the spider as mature enough for them to eat the rest of it well fantastic where\nWe've seen horror movies about insects crawling into people's heads and depositing eggs and whatever it is that possible with wires can they go outside people and\nWhat yeah he was he even bought fly fail um I've not had this yet but it's it's it's amazing it is in central and South America\nThat is really big and beautiful massive eyes and quite clumsy flyers and quite noisy floods [noise] so they figured out to catch either a who fly or a mosquito\nAnd then they ... they will eggs on the underside all these mosquitoes and say when the mosquito flies along\nWhen she's still feeding on you at that point the ... for the whole it's quite fantastic and they would spend a couple of weeks just munching away underneath your skin so you can see them and have them at night can you do anything about them we get rid of them\nBut I mean they didn't do any real damage\nOr do well [laughter] depends what your career or damage immigrate to scare the scale of things not really a flu\nOr you mentioned in the book that you turn down the opportunity to actually have a fly traveled through was your system\nI sadly have an ... one of my good friends I have one\nAnd sadly from me he wouldn't let the reroute say officer about a week or so he was like Ericka and for me and said if you remove this thing from my head because it was on the head it couldn't go down and had to go along the cranium so you could really watch it develop\nAnd hands I Know this has to come out and so we're in the jungle there's nothing I could really day so I've just stacked vice lean over the top to suffocate them because they they prevented that anal spirit coast so they breathe better that bottom so you can see there's a ... waving around say you suffocate them\nAnd then I Need this type thing with ... which I thought it was very generous\nAnd then I slightly cut type and he's had to be up to extract the larvae out of it [noise]\nBut yeah it's in the collection now which is good\nAnd you enjoyed every second of it and signed up [laughter] it was fascinating stuff\nOh there's so much to talk about the ... we're talking with Barry ... author of the secret life of wives let me tell you this is one eye opening book beautifully done I'm sure Dr McAllister thank you and and you make the point parents\nFor her being we've ignored their biome diversity studies we study all kinds of things we don't study flyers\nNo I mean signs of very difficult if you you look at the age in the EU\nAnd the great Victorian hunters and never on guys on about the ... the tools and the amazing ... and if because actually that quite easy to identify in many ways\nButterflies you've ... of the U.S patterns on the wings that quite easy flies\nTiny black scientists have quite a common thing across all of them and a lot of the identification is on genitalia dissections which is quite fatally and I was he in a lot of things that might ... for a lot of people just ignore them\nAnd then whether they are ... that a lot of stage fate base he just resemble sleeping bags full of vegetable soup and very few features about them and just get\nAnd then just guys yeah there's a lot of ... and that's it no matter how fast enough to take a it's a radical\nI Know I mean imagine there and a habitat that they have butts and said\nYou write their own pitch in and I always saying\nArrogant McAllister author of the secret life of flies we're going to take a break and come back and talk lots more with her
