I'm not getting involved in politics you called judge a justice Elena Kagan\nSaying quote we should be aware of the environment and not unnecessarily exacerbate the divisions that unfortunately exist now she said this on September twelfth before the cabin on proceedings went into full blown chaos mode but on a personal level\nHow are the justices responding to their branch being at the center of such a painful fight\nAh that's that's precisely the kind of case but I Will say that is the second case was a agents termination case and\nThere was seemed to be broad consensus on the court in favor of the employees against the smaller fire department that had fired a to a fire fighters or the older they're two oldest firefighters on whether or not they were covered by this federal law so yeah that's a reminder that\nYou know a fair number of cases forty percent maybe more are near unanimous or unanimous on the court and there is only a relative minority that divide along this ah for four or five for ideological split\nJasper even Supreme Court correspondent for the wall Street Journal thank you for being on America on the line\nThanks for having me so when the show started I I'd I'd throughout a question\nWhat can we regular everyday ... folks do to calm things down and I wanted to hear how how you're dealing with the situation in your own family the number's eight four four seven four or five eight to five five and Dennis in union county New Jersey called\nEnd Dennis thank you for calling into America on the line\nHello Jonathan Hi so how are you dealing with it\nWell I I actually don't know if I Am I don't I Hope the screener that uh I'm a huge destruction worker or younger guy living at home and my dad was actually a union while there for Thirty years\nAnd he's gotten older and headed towards retirement I've just seen in sort of fall pretty a propaganda ... this information of the conservative media and it's really confused me I mean I told your screener\nMy dad was a stock he didn't go to Vietnam but during the twenty sixteen election cycle we had a veterans for Trump signed hanging the car garage and wow so it's been really difficult especially as I become more active than my Indian politically or go into labor marches Skilling sealed\nCanvassing events where were\nYou know putting out democratic candidates who have been pro labor\nRight I think it's really difficult right now so that is so what does your dad say when you ask how do you go from Woodstock to from [noise]\nA lot of it seems like he's falling for the dean of Soviet fear mongering that's the biggest one ... um she it seems like the dog whistles and the\nRacial divide there there's a fear that spin implants had in him that I don't see on a person to person basis when you know he's interacting with someone with a different race I can tell you\nMy best friend in the world is half white half black and he's done things for my best friend's family I'm On both sides you know fixing cars driving\nHis eighty five year old African American grandfather to go get his medicine at the pharmacy\nBut at the same time he'll talk about ...

Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line if there's one thing most of us can probably agree on is that last Thursday Senate Judiciary committee hearing and which Dr Christine Blasey Ford and judge Brett Kavanaugh testified\nWas an emotional deeply disturbing display and judge Kavanaugh's tone was a far cry from his last appearance before the committee this statement in particular gave many people pause\nThis whole week effort as fact calculated and orchestrated political heck fuels with a parent pent\nUp anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition\nGroups compare that to how judge Kavanaugh described the correct judicial temperament in twenty Fifteen at Catholic university\nTo be a good judge in a good umpire it's important to have the proper demeanor\nReally important I said to walk and the others choose whether it be the other litigants I voted against in the case the other judges to understand them to keep our emotions in check\nTo be calm admits the storm on the bench to to put into the vernacular don't be a jerk I think that's important\n[noise] so I wanted to play those two clips because I just want to know if if\nIf this is a new normal for the for the Supreme Court and\nHave we ever seen the Supreme Court so politicized before and I'm going to bring in a in a presidential historian of Supreme Court historian a little bit later in this segment but I Want to bring in my panel now to talk this through and joining me in the studio is WNYC is Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show\nHe took a question from ABC News White House reporter Cecilia Vega\nTake a listen to how that went yeah go\nShe shocked that I picked her as I said OSHA [laughter]\nI'm not thinking of that so I Know you're not thinking you never do\nThat was pretty extraordinary Brian I'm I mean we know the president talks about the press in very [laughter] I'm disparaging\nTerms but for him to do that to a a female member of the White House press corps just even hearing it yet again it's so it's it's a shocking in how um [noise] I'm at a loss for words\nThe author and I figure you also cut off another woman reporter and occurred way when she yes it in line and let us Kevin lied under oath I think that was the question ... so maybe for the absurd contrast of the day Trump also said that he and Kim Jong on have fallen in love\nHe actually said that that they started off rough but Kim has now written a beautiful letter to him and they're in love\nOne of the most brutal dictators in the world often seen is running the worse government on the planet but he and Trump are in love according to Trump and women journalists who ask tough questions or have an even asked a tough question yet as an Cecilia Vegas case\nOr the enemy of the people and they don't think\n... you brought up I'm Caitlin calling from CNN um if the the other female journalist who was called on by President Trump and take a listen to this very quick\nLike I say us go ahead please can you probably don't want to really ... you've had enough\nNow she said that that is very quickly it's only about five seconds but Caitlin Caitlin Collins you hear that tail end of her trying to ask the president a question and he keeps talking over her as she tries to ask a ask her questions I mean Janelle\nMade a journalist job is hard but when the president just this respects um women journalists like this and I put it like that because I\nMean he does that two men but in this moment that we're in it just it ... to me speaking personally it hits me it's rather galling\nYeah [noise] no I mean the president certainly has a habit of disrespecting both the press and women are in doing so openly and I think we've become a little bit to newer to that if it's not quite enough of a problem\nOr in this in this society but I think that you know [noise] you have your an example of him not being able to contain his ... next year and a\nPress conference you don't get to choose which questions you get asked\nAnd I've been through your body can make that point herself afterwards you don't get to select a you know what ... you know get brought into the conversation\nYou get to answer the question and I think frankly for President Trump was not willing to\nBe a part of that he very frankly if you should never run for public service and I know that that sounds maybe a little bit of a to Z given the fact that he's the president then there's all these kind of\nA you know benefits of the office ran loves but I mean frankly he's a public servant he answers to us in the press is an extension of the public needs to quickly either under understand that were being made to understand that by the people in other people or once we have ...\nAnd when I'm going to give you the last word on this but I also in your in your response I I I Want you to respond to this or are we flash me am I making too much\nOf how he treated Cecilia Vega and Caitlin colon\nWell I understand your reaction and I shared a little bit but I Do have to say that uh in the president's defense he is an equal opportunity jackass\nAnd um has gone after men in the most demeaning possible ways that he can think of at the moment he after all he\nIs most famous a controversial comment at the beginning of twenty sixteen was about John McCain and and challenging his heroism um he made fun of Rubio's sweating he said the case it was a slob\nUm he accused Ted Cruz's father of having been in on the John F. Kennedy assassination it goes on and on so um yeah he's he's grotesque to women 'em up but he is to men as well so that's my sense of the president\n[noise] you know I wanted a in a little bit of time we've got time to play at a here is what Senator Flake and senator Coons have to say about the Kavanaugh nomination\nIf judge Kavanaugh\nIs shown to have lied to the committee [noise] nominations over\nI Would think so and\n... yes or no answer Brian you agree yesterday agreed the nominations over if he's found that is\nWhy I think they could get to a point where the quibbling over how ...\nIt should be Mona\nIt's going to depend on how a senators Collins and Murkowski and flake interpret alliances\nAnd with that we have to go thank you all for being on America on the line tomorrow it's all about the Mueller investigation we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support is provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr marrying white\nHouston Public media is able to bring this programming tail because it's studios society affinity council members like ... and Roy Davis Carolyn implant Davis the third and ... and more skilled and the white Riley\nPresident Trump's celebrates a new free trade deal with Mexico and Canada we don't take it as a privilege it's a privilege for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico I'm Talking about everybody\nEverybody but what does that mean as trade wars continue how phrase may be changing or the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News this morning at five o'clock on Houston Public\nMedia's news eighty eight seven this is your NPR station Houston Public radio news eighty seven to each of Houston and she reached T.

requiring public companies in oil companies but public companies have at least one woman on the board some businesses on how people do but I Wonder why\nPut up through California's been climbing the company listed on the stock market have at least one woman on the board was food HUD\nBy business lobby group so now the little has passed then don't happy and wound it could be difficult to implement ... one hundred big funds which have go by headquarters in California have new women a tool in the boardroom and they've now got three years to make the appointments do face fines\nOf up to three hundred thousand dollars we'll just go in and from Loyola Law school and those kinds of these is against the measure and joins us now by Jessica\nHi thanks for having me what's wrong with the little promoting gender equality given that women okay any underrepresented at the top of California's companies\nOh clearly underrepresented ... grossly underrepresented and not only grossly underrepresented but we know it's incredibly important to have\nWomen on not just publicly traded boards but on private boards we know it's incredibly important to have women in politics in the law and we're nowhere near that I just don't like the fact\nThat this is a government mandated quota and I actually think that it's\nLikely or has some serious legal issues and may not withstand constitutional scrutiny\nRight so you think businesses then might if they push for it to be able to get this little ... and\nI think absolutely businesses are ready to file in court if not tomorrow the next day and the problem for an American court system is of course we have something called equal protection under the law\nAnd this law specifically on its face creates a preference for women and I'm not sure that um that California will be able to defend that in the legislative history when\nOur lawmakers were debating this there was an analysis that said there could be some serious legal challenges here and you can't just point to statistics and say there's gross under representation of women because that's true you need more than that to withstand constitutional scrutiny\nBut if companies themselves on a lot of companies on putting women on boards and the government you'll thing shouldn't be able to to mandate to then some companies would get away with never having a woman up until\nI unfortunately I think that that is largely true but the government can do something without mandating it so the government can say will create incentives will give you tax breaks if you want to have more gender diversity and the government can do a number of different things to exercise his authority without mandating a quota\nThe other thing is I think that it's not necessarily going to get us to the policy outcome we want to take the legal issues and put them to the side\nI think it's going to be very difficult for that token woman to walk into the boardroom knowing that she's only

with the nature of the earthquake that triggered the ...\n[noise] yes well the type of earthquake that happened um a few days ago it's a type of an earthquake where the crust moose side by side\nAnd those types of earthquakes typically don't generate lots of vertical land motion and it is this type of vertical land motion that we mostly can associate with your nominee\nAnd so because the ... was\nLarger than we would expect or a a strikes what type of an earthquake we have to look into other possible reasons about why that Saddam me was so large right\nThat's crystal clear tell us what the speculation might be because this is going to be a teachable moment isn't it\nAbsolutely so um other reason other sources other ways of creating a nominee would be a submarine landslide\nOr perhaps the geometry of the the the seat for and we have seen lots of evidence or landslide on land devastating mudslides and\nLandslides along the coastline and so it's not unreasonable to presume

particular warning system because it would it it it would have depended on boys would another system possibly have worked better\n[noise] uh I'm not sure I'm not certain of of a type of uh early warning system for another ... nominees but the important takeaway message that um that we can learn from this horrible disaster with all the\nPreventable preventable deaths is that people when they live and earthquake country and they live close ... close to the shoreline or they're visiting the beach they need to recognize that they have the power the knowledge\nTo understand that if the ground shakes for twenty seconds or more that is they're warning\nAnd that they need to get to high ground\nThat is very important so you're saying we in effect to be relying too much on the authorities to make an alarm that they may or may not then lift the scientist to interpret it it's actually it's the education that you would have hoped after the disaster of two thousand to fool that message would've sung Kim\nAbsolutely and that is why this uh this disaster is really sad\nBecause ah people didn't learn that message so hopefully we can all learn from this message\nUm that if you're an earthquake country the ground is shaking and you're close to the coastline that you need to get high ground and stay there\nIn in two thousand four of the people that live in the islands offshore ... they had an oral history when the ground shut they went up to high ground and they stayed there for a week and and that's what happened in two thousand four\nSo hopefully we can help educate people so

Florida another tropical locations worldwide working hard to save endangered ecosystems by creating so cool to coral nurseries one of those doing that to Jessica levy she's a program manager of the coral restoration foundation\nCalled nurseries they are tools used in car restoration efforts to basically produce more corals so called nursery is just like a plant nursery except it they're located in the ocean and usually within tend to five meters adept\nWhich mostly treats aren't challenges a comedy the easiest thing to create\nNo exactly there are a lot of just school challenges I'm most operations at the school bus of course you're limited on on the amount of air that you have near tanks there are lots of um restrictions and logistical challenges that we get you know there is also exposures and influences of storms and hurricanes\nSo a nursery is extremely unique a nursery it's\nLocated in Sandy habitat ordinarily there would be nothing and because there are structures and there's live coral growing there\nThere's lots of different fish and and for her to Britain marine life that has like congregated within the nurseries um so it's only a site that can be seen in very few areas so it's a beautiful sight but it is very different than your typical coral reef setting\nAnd vulnerable to I mean you ... you had a hard time just lost it and ...\nYes absolutely the nurseries can be very vulnerable to hurricanes we have ways that we can try to mitigate some of our losses um you know we're able to maintain the structures replace their anchoring devices and kind of prepare for storms we do a lot of work as we're entering in hurricane season\nAnd I'm just basically hope for the best is a very very strong storm there's very little that we can do to protect them so we just have a couple of trips to the trade that we kind of help manage our losses and we know a star might be approaching\nWhy it's so important to set up an usher\nNaturally they're important because their way of producing more coral so some restoration programs go to a healthy area on ... um ... calls from there and move them directly to a degraded site\nYou're really just moving corals around you're not actually producing more material to the nursery stepped actually allows you to create more corals to put back on uh the reefs as part of restoration efforts\nOver all you'll find a losing battle on ... dying out pretty far [laughter]\nThey are it is a daunting task that is very that's very on that very true and I think everyone and restoration recognizes that we have past the tipping point and we cannot replace every coral that was ever lost on the reef\nWhat we're working towards right now is really just putting out corals with a high enough opponents enough genetic

what kind of success was she having some office by now I mean cause she live off her painting\nMany of her paintings she gave to friends up until that moment I think the really the first time she got money from some selling he'll look to someone who she wasn't a friend who was probably to Edward G.

know the cause of who is one of Mexico City's most visits museums but how well known in Mexico was color at the point of her death\nI don't think she was well known amongst the population at large but she was very well known amongst the artists a funeral the ... and I think most Mexican intellectuals in office will say\nI remember when I was of that generation would say I remember when I was treated colors funeral she had an intimacy with the people that she\nUh lived amongst but she didn't have the big popular following that now we're talking about what\nDo we know how high reputation

they identify with her as ... and they created a different a static wet\nThe uh the personal could be seen as the vehicle through which\nGood up could be produced as opposed to believing that oh it

ah thoughts the people she'd worked with her pain and suffering that there was a great deal of identification with free to buy people who'd never seen a single work by free to call her\nBecause her

sixteen lessons ... it went for eight million dollars so that sixteen times as much you can actually\nGo further back in and say in in the late Nineteen seventies or what by color went for twenty thousand dollars of what you saw in that decade of the eighties was an enormous growth of interest in her work and us being an exemplar of a woman who's Korea had been overshadowed by the time all famous husband\nWants your thoughts on this what would you pick houses the key things that accounts for me she already rising popularity\nWell I Do think that late seventies eighties it was first the Latina artists and then the feminist art is with Hayden and his book clearly two thousand and two summer hired ... film further popularized Frida Kahlo but I think that for me what's really interesting is that\nBeyond the sensationalism of her biography her paintings and her art the deeper people look they see that she was clearly of her time influenced by the Mexican revolution by by communism et cetera but she was also ahead of her time\nSo it wasn't just feminist it was also people with disabilities people of color\nPeople who were marginalized her work deals with issues that are very relevant today like identity the female body a gender cross dressing or issues of what it means to feel fractured inside\nNot be able to be a mother or not want to be a mother she gives visual voice to topics that had never been discussed or represented in the visual arts\nAnd she completes the destabilized or the cannon that we had earlier where when I was studying art history we studied white men's art\nA pain to observe the budget and so many ways I guess she was ahead of time in the way she patriot gender too in her paintings because sometimes I'm Suzie she dresses in men's clays doesn't she and then she's\nPainting herself with her famous eyebrows joined up and sometimes you have little starfish that she paints and trafficking women with notes painted in that little sauce so so why she emphasizing these characteristics cheating but she doing here\nI thing is as we have been discussing is the idea of playing but different insults in identities if we talk about how she portray herself as the men I mean that shows her gender ... that he's so contemporary and we talk so much about today or\nThe intersection she represents a some Mexican woman as an artist female dark skin Mexican and disable if all these values are so relevant today\nAnd she's always interrogation norms and assumptions isn't she Henri on I'm thinking of her painting a few small ... when she's talking about how women are regarded I Wonder if she could tell us about this painting\nA few small nips shows a murder victim something she read about in the newspapers and the tabloid press\nMexico if someone who'd been stopped multiple times by the\nLover when questioned by police was reportedly said all I did was give her a few small nips the painting shows a buddy covered in ... blood falling out of the frame of the picture as though it's leaking I'm to the gallery flow was about\nThe way in which human beings can act in incredibly in human waste ... each other\nAnd she was I think more horrified by the few small nips from uc than by the fact that this person had been stopped\nI'm guinea is a painting of herself around the time of her divorce remove era where she's dressed as a mom but with her head chopped off and she writes the top I Love you for your ... now you don't have a drink lover you read the mole what she tried to send his picture\nWell she comes from Mexico a very macho society uh she comes from a place where women did not have the vote until after free the colors that that's so think about it she was very political but she couldn't even vote in Mexico during her lifetime\nA in this specific painting she shows herself removing vestiges of her femininity\nHer braids her her hair\nAnd she's putting on something that looks like an oversized men sued taking on the power and the authority that males have\nThe lyrics that she writes on top were friends how women's identities and sexuality is tied in with their hair and how there is no unconditional love of women only if they act in a certain way so I think into a few small knit she\nUncovers the violence against women and here she tries to free herself of this role of a woman who is subordinate to a man and shows herself as a kind of an ... creature\nSo see all this attention to detail in the space of ... and ... and the ... question and ... but\nThe same time she's in some logical she's referred to as the Sophie queen isn't she referring to not just her ... use of self portraits but the way she shapes how she's deceived very deliberately\nThey just choose she very constantly developed to sign up

private self seeking to promote every aspect of their life of me doing Instagram and Carlo did it before\nWe'll go oriented what's very important is to recognize how self conscious she was\nOf how her image was something she constructed to self when you talked about why did she paint them stop ... it was because she was constructing this persona\nThat she wanted to use as a vehicle to articulate to thought she was not just free to she was the artist Frida Kahlo creating this image of free to\nThrough which to articulate how book\nYeah and when you see her paintings I mean if ever I was saying

at the center as to what to do\nMy grandmother when I was growing up suffered from very severe depression that went undiagnosed for quite a long time and ended up actually leading to her very early demise\nThat was one of the very early sparks that interested me in a better understanding how we can think about disease and and treat it out of my own experience but then as I developed in this field of women's health and beginning to understand\nThat there were these profound sex differences across organ systems and in psychiatric disease as well and to better understand what happened then and how we actually change the path forward\nOne of my earliest seminars that I took as an undergraduate at Harvard was with a professor named Ruth Hubbard and she was the first ten year old woman in the biology department at Harvard\nShe was a renowned feminist and had work to develop a field that focused on looking at biology through a feminist lens\nAnd it really opened my eyes to\nThe historical issues that women face but also how that intersected with biology with science and with care and I came in wanting to be a physician and it just sparked a life long journey for me\nBecause my women for you\nOf course my mother's fresh gynecologist in to my yeah so seen are working hard and and saving the woman and she lost her mother doing the birth so that was the motivation for her and she was in ... to me\nWell she's an incredible woman you must have looked at the mission human rights activist and twenty twelve Nobel Peace prize nominee wishy part of the reason you choose to become a doctor\nActually that was not my first choice when I was growing up because I spent to me or it can like um area we leave the next to the hospital\nSo the child that used to run and hide and and play in hospital and in our own family my both siblings and my father had to see me I smoke\nSo I have seen and learned to med scene so early as age of ten I knew what injection means and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd it's like no I Wonder if the story and I love history I used to listen old grandmothers who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you didn't have choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but ... had been and as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided he's where I have to be you know this is where my energy is more important than anywhere else says my delivery and my first child that made me to accept my ... this\nTime when you when you look at you finished Fifteen sixteen I have no idea in mid seem back on anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was during the surgery and I'm running to them and to change that she is about to deliver and they see we in the middle of surgery just to go look at\nAnd I'm standing next to this woman freaking out the screaming and she's holding my hand and tells you like just told the child makes your ... doesn't fall\nAnd he used to do twenty four years old and he just get married and then I'm so proud of him and as soon as I\nKnow I think credible [laughter]\nDid did you come across any of these IDs and your medical training all sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because he will change in Russia that could definitely\nFor us as my mother's work and my work it's just putting the woman's house first\nIt's not the scientific level is just to give them access and being first and instead of coal contend nation taking care of the only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so that's where we were thinking about it I'm every woman has to has access to health care and it's a basic healthcare cleaned delivery\nAnd knowing a bug Dr John this work it just makes more fascinating yes that's what people are supposed to focus that's what the research should be\nPointed when you were practicing cardiologist how do you think your agenda in since you approach to your work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you for sure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center\nOf women's health it's the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live\nAs well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure\nAnd I think being a woman you've lived that life and you I think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught but I Do think you were starting in a different place\nAnd you've had stopped because when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were a woman\nIt's a huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you in discussing sexual issues there Ninety eight percent to some other woman went to the F G and female genital mutilation so their challenges they're difficult to stay facing you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in a position in Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait or has been a brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just different activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just asked\nWhat was your breakfast I usually asked my patients do they have you eaten you because she sometimes forget herself she has ten kids and she had been even eaten you know the you know she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your ... when a female patient walks in one of the things you're taking into consideration and it comes to like everything\nI think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality said you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came to being the a leading in flood level was very extremely they know in the condition in somebody we don't have blood bank so\nWe have human ... so you need to call every one who has the exact today that\nThe blood and and draw divide so we struggled after you know six seven hours looking at ... and ... and she's good to go now I was telling ... you cannot have children you have to wait you have to do this given all this\nPatient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet\nAnd I was so if you guys you know starting breach inherent you know you want to die you ought to do this and by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from is not only being a physician who or training to what that time for my clinical skill and where ...\nOnce you come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the first ones off coupon about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for a long because most treatments were designed for men not women ... is that well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nBeers in here in United States and I got all the ideas information I learn how to improve my leadership so I'm trying not to be the only one defendant and everything so I give the leadership to a lot of leaders on the ground\nAnd pull you the first African American president to Wellesley College in the United states and ... just women's college um he's alumni include can if you can to Madeleine Albright what was it like to take on that role\nBut it was a great honor as you can imagine having a focus on women's health ... through my career and academic medicine to transition to a position of leadership\nAnd understanding not only how we prepare young women who are students to really make a difference in the world but also what is it that Wellesley College can also do to make the world a better place\n[noise] and ... IV cooled women's health and equal rights issue as important as equal pay isn't really as important\nWithout health what is there I think that we have to really focus on health and wellbeing as central to our equality and it is an equality issue as we think about the work that we do here\nProviding an environment in which young women can grow strong where they are educated but also where we focus on their health and wellbeing it's the totality it's a holistic\nApproach health and wellbeing and economic parity or in my mind and ... linked and societies that don't provide economic parity are most likely not providing parity as we think about health and wellbeing\nAnd decode what does it mean to you to be a female community lead to\nMy community undermines you as a woman but being a woman leader I have more windows to have a conversation with men because I'm not fair to them so they could she didn't know community leaders elderly world loads and go in front of them have the conversation much easier than if I was in ...\nI used the disadvantage the country things as a woman leader as advantage and that's how we save our community me and my mother was doing for ... work\nTo honor its very crucial to be a woman leader and woman on the table so that's that's the only way we can progress and bring peace in my country\nPoint what does it mean to you to be a female community leader\nIt's a great honor to be able to use your voice to improve the lives of others and to have influence on\nVarious aspects whether it be policy whether it be here at Wellesley whether it be and how we carry out medicine both in the United states and beyond before I left academic medicine we\nHad produced a large policy report talking about the sex differences\nAnd pointed out where progress had not been made and that report was taken and what it led to was a very large policy change just two years ago at the national institutes of health\nThat will now mandate the inclusion of women an adequate numbers and all phases of clinical trials but also mandate the inclusion of female cells and animals and pre clinical studies to have that on our to work with my colleagues over time just\nSee that change happen it's what we live for\nDick who what do you think you take away from your conversation with pointed today\nIt's it's the of honor and gratitude just to be new with her and listen and I wish I could just listen not talk [laughter]\nTo see in the policies you're making a difference is you know I'm I'm so fascinating reading all the research and that will consider\nThanking the medication I'm given to my woman patient you to females patient how they will affect the body so I learned that from you ... and I'm very honored and ... thank\nYou [noise] deco I think the power of your dedication commitment you are enormous courage\nYour boldness how you conceive of women's health and how you make that actionable in the most difficult of settings is truly an inspiration so thank you\nWell thank you keep those poor black and decker thank you so much or happiness\nAnd like yesterday we took to declare Mohammed similarly inductive he runs a hospital in school with a new refugee camp in Somalia and dumped Paula Jones and he's been at the forefront of the mission to get up to be considered gender differences in medical research and treatment I'm back again next week's brand new episode and to me time to check out to all ... any updates\nOn the conversation you might've missed or if you haven't already subscribed to put caused such BBC the compensation wherever you can you put cost thinks listening\nOr weekly podcast with up to them in a policy conversation that you can use at your next cocktail party or tailgate brand running house from University of Houston and I'm sure they are from Texas from university where do you subscribe to the party politics podcast you'll get more to it on\nWhat's happening in politics each week here in Texas and around the country and now you can hear party politics on the radio every Friday night at ten thirty right here on news eighty eight seven some joined us on demand and on the air\nFind out more at Houston Public media's [noise]\nA lot of ... minutes\nOne elevator before you had to the polls November or listen to candidates give their debt elevator pitch visit Houston Public media dot org slash pitch\nTo surgery NPR station Houston Public radio news radio ...

about it and I wanted to really try to change people's behavior in this respect it's a very difficult thing to change people's behavior will come on to that\nYeah absolutely but I thought why do people throw away so many items and uh one of the reasons is that we no longer make repairs\nSo we don't learn how to do it um do you think it's a skill that we've lost absolutely yeah in the old days people who were told by their parents that when something breaks you try to fix it and\nA technique was one simpler then so it was easier to fix but nowadays we no longer learn that we have no tools we have no skills and new products are around everywhere and they're not so expensive so\nWhen something breaks the road to a new item is much simpler easier than the road to having something really bad\nI mean I mean you talk about the little scales to people starting to have the skills anymore I'm not an issue works and depends on two things depends on as you mentioned earlier on people actually being prepared to\nBring this stuff and to get it fixed and the moon and the second thing it depends on the other volunteers for them to kind of gave up that time and do this how many people these repairs um where where did you find them how do you get in touch with people in the first place if you say that those skills so some people do have\nIn in many people does nothing all

around in his shit I mean we can bring in Chris Lee who's in London Hi Chris you run to RIMPAC cap and roasted nuts but you're right\nAbout Enron and yes whereabouts and miles from Cambridge\nInterest just tell us you know what do you personally get out of repairing stuff what'd you give up your time\nI think ultimately it's the satisfaction of saying somebody's face when something is men that that they have a strong ... but they thought was kind of have to be thrown away but I didn't want to try to why are they wanted to try and keep being used for as long as possible\nAnd I and I think earlier you mentioned about the sentimental value\nOf of some items that are\nPaid for a full throated right\nYeah it's not it's not just new checking you catches the presidents don't just electronic stuff um someone had\nNo the pick of the bed there's a big market nearby it's at all in the corner\nHow'd you get away from harming most other businesses you say you're taking a long have you been away from us\nSo in this uh Bekesi you have potential to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it said the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking their business over the\nCourse here and I like to point to go ahead what we find is obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh\nI'm guessing assessed tend to be told to calm the retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take care of some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC cafe down have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nNow for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor is sex tidy so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that's labor or should be taxed lower so that\nA professional repairs have become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business and um [noise]\nI I don't know of course there will be different labor costs in different pulses of welfare so\nYou're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work in terms of costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit to a landfill thought the other day have listened to the\nVery [noise]\nIf they laugh at what you think you can do [noise]\nStay that way [noise] believe in something\nEven if it means sacrificing everything\nLike a commercial using the face and woods at the American football quarterback Colin

for the national anthem ball sorry Nike I've been buying you fill a past twenty plus years not even worth\nFive pairs of shoes and they all going to let them very like he decided to call them cabinet when he doesn't share the same opinion\nThat's how it's going to be Nike sound cabinet is going to be your spokesman announced okay when I spent my whole life is a Nike man not no more though so that's how you're going to do it I'm sure you harm onto it how you're going to put ... on the cover of your advertisements ... I like cats\nWell along with him President Trump himself even tweeted in early September that in his words Nike was getting absolute he killed with anger and boycotts\nActually it hasn't been still Galloway is professor of marketing at NYU Stern school of business and he told me what happened to Nike shoes sales since the campaign began\nInitially there was some concern that the firm was alienating a core consumer group and you saw the stock took a hit the next day there are a lot of people that went on line very sort of vocal minority of consumers who burnt their Nikes and the marketplace was concerned that they were alienating\nA core consumer base what's happened since then now is that it's apparent this may have been actually a good thing the stock is more than recovered and touches all time highs in his online sales are proxy for broader sales it looks as if their sales have noticed fleet ticked up\n... how do you account for that given all of the negative publicity the public shoe budding and that we've been seeing the tweets from Donald Trump complaining about Nike what's going on\nWell to borrow from Nike's tagline Nike just did it or specifically Nike just did the math Nike sales are thirty five billion dollars twenty billion is registered outside of the U.S Fifteen billion domestically\nAmong that Fifteen billion two thirds are from consumers under the age of thirty five and if you're under the age of thirty five and\nCan afford a hundred and fifty dollar pair of Nike flying that racers you likely a skew towards a higher earner and maybe dwell in a city which means most likely\nYou lean left show by my calculations they'd probably wrist about one to three billion dollars of\nBusiness domestically amounts at the high end whereas abroad that twenty billion dollars there are very few people outside of the U.S that would argue that the U.S is on the right track and is doing a good job of handling race relations so in exchange\nFor potentially alienating one to three billion about thirty five billion dollar franchise\nThey strengthen the relationship with thirty two to thirty for going on so distinctive whether you think this was the right or the wrong thing to do it was absolutely the shareholder thing to do so in some Nike adjusted the math\nIt's interesting it's almost taking a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook you might argue to galvanize urine coal support even if it risks alienating alienating some some on the outside\nThat's all right great brands not only decide who they're for but who they are not for and they made a statement here it came across as bald it came across as authentic and genuine and it was just a great trade to potentially upset one to three billion dollars if you're a consumer franchise about strengthening thirty one or thirty three\nWas a fantastic move Nike has\nThem the move to embrace calling ... will go down as one of the better marketing move since the last decade\nDo you think that's more broadly true that in the age of social media and the age where people are much more used to kind of shouting out and perhaps opposing other people the bands that being called ... kind of more okay than it was\nWhat we're all hoping that sports would be kind of is a waste is from politics and it ended up at the last firewall or politics sports has been breached so there's no escaping\nIt now what Nike was able to do with dominate the headlines and buy some standards or by some estimates garnered somewhere between a quarter of a billion and three hundred and fifty million dollars in free advertising this to a certain extent is taking up\nA page out of the playbook of Donald Trump who constantly dominates the headlines with controversial statements and also big tax that is known for not advertising why because they don't need to show Nike has done a great job hair grabbing the Mike back from other big tech and other consumer companies\nStill got away here on business daily from the BBC so is this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor got away suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than splashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we wanted to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. have also taken to activism as a personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take too much in the founder and chairman of the British pub chain ...\nIs a long time you were a skeptic he came out ahead of the British referendum on ... membership in twenty sixteen as an ... even stuck that message on these pub PMS how does that affect the best sales I wondered well\nWe'd been fairly apolitical whether ... for the first twenty or so years of our existence and the first thing that cool ma I was the debate over the euro and that is well started the bull rolling so campaign successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given a choice like everyone else had to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for a company and decided to campaign that just ...\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another just to get on your band that and to decorate your various hubs with that message\nWell that's right of course there were a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the foot sea hundred companies signed a lesser say ... ...\nDefinitely be better off if we stay in a new\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean it's one thing to go on the media and an express your personal opinion it's another given that you know presumably fifty percent of your customers might well support staying in the\nI did worry about it I'd already done it during the ... the euro era and the euro debate\nAnd the way that I think people except to the is unlike say the Financial Times all the times of the guardian in a magazine which is where I wrote a lot of my aunts uncles we had articles arguing the opposite of what I was saying\nSo I think it helped us that we could cite we are and organizer Asian which here's my view but we will\nPrint an equal number of articles with the opposite view\nRight but the ... pretty one sided these days on the\nYeah the beer match you're right the ... are more one sided that they made the case for leave and I think people believe debates is required if you're going to make a good decision\nOn the debates is part of a democracy not everyone agrees with me over this late but you've got guys like Michael O'Leary has made us is this your first campaign in favor of remaining in the this is the head of Ryan and the head of ... in there\nAnd I think it's been accepted that Michael O'Leary says one thing to him says another and it's such a big existential questions for the economy but I think customers broadly welcome the debate\nThe thing about breaks it though is it has become as in it I mean a very divisive issue for many people suddenly for the people who feel strongly about it as he even just talk right now of a ... second referendum next year which would perhaps be even more divisive could\nHow would you go into that I mean again it would put you at all with a large subset presumably of your customers\nWill that's right I think it might put the adults with the subset of them I mean ultimately a rule was said to them look at the end of the day this is your decision it's a democracy that's what it's all about you decide what do I know but I think it's democracies at stake under very important\nIssues for for freedom the economy liberty and so on I think it's right that business people speak out the public isn't stupid you know just cause I make the case for leave doesn't mean they they'll agree with me\nToday I Am listing the polar bears are
