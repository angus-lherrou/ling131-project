in Sydney and they'll correct me if I'm wrong but traditionally em Australia's always opposed moving its embassy in Israel so why the change of heart\nRunning back in June when the current prime minister scope Morrison was the treasure in the Australian government he said that there was no sense in supporting moving the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem now the prime minister\nSays he's changing his mind off the discussions with his liberal party candidates in this weekend's crucial by election in Sydney that candidate to demand by the name of David ... he's a

votes at the United nations on the Palestinian authority being recognized as the chair of the G Seventy seven group of developing nations Australia or incidentally\nSays it intends to vote no so the prime minister saying that there are regional global reasons why he has made this announcement his critics here in Australia\nI Believe that it's a final parochial far more about domestic politics given that there is a crucial by election into Sydney seat to when with on Saturday that seat by the way was vacated by the former prime minister Malcolm tumble that was our state as leader in the policy room to and the reason why this by like she needs sewing pull each\nIs the scope Morrison center right government has just do one seat majority\nIn Australia is lower house of federal parliament so if it loses this election at the weekend that goes it some ... majorities slim majority\nIn parliament so what you have to remember that went with these home to about well Thirteen percent of voters and went with a Jewish and there are concerns among critics of the prime minister that his announcement regarding the embassy in Jerusalem is just a ... a desperate attempt to win votes\nIs that the main thrust of the criticism\n[noise] it is we've been speaking to the Australia Palestine advocacy network and ... believes that team brought it to Australia's suggestion that he could move its embassy in Israel\nTo Jerusalem is ludicrous I'm arguing that Australia is aligning itself with quote the most direct take reaction rate and bullish U.S foreign policy and a\nDiplomatic

Emily ... thanks for joining America on the line tonight\nI think I Am\nOr we all know how Trump has said putting denies involvement in the twenties sixteen election as just putting as a credible source and maybe it was a four hundred pound hacker sitting on his couch and since that's been affected for him I guess listen to the similarities\nWith what he said this morning about the evidence that the Saudi Government had killed your colleague ...\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I\nWant to get by but it sounded to me like maybe they should it be rolled\nOut we're going to try getting to the bottom of it\n... who knows the ambush sound familiar\nYeah you're exactly right ... thanks very years now at this point on whether Russia meddled in the two thousand sixteen election just that day he told CBS luckily all you know Russia they met all I think China metal to\n'em and in much more domestically we've seen the president gives\nMen in it or get accused of behaving badly the benefit of the doubt even when others in his party don't want to stand by that I'm thinking in particular Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race that Republicans walk last\nOr that's up by a whopping thirty two points from the same poll just before the twenty four team midterm elections for women under forty\nPart of the polish findings about how the bridge tunnel Christine Blasey Ford spectacles affecting everyone's eagerness to vote could you break up those results\nYeah absolutely you jumped on the key point women I Want to vote and they lean democratic we already knew that from several other calls that women want to vote or more likely to vote Democrat or Republican\nI many fourteen percentage points where men tend to lean Republican or Democrat but it by like a\nFive to six percentage points on and so after the Kavanaugh hearings what this call's really captured\nIs enthusiast than going out a among independents\nAs well as women toward the Democratic party um and not because you have a majority of Americans not approving of cabinet are sitting on the court and small majority of Americans it's about fifty percent ... when you break it out a way from registered voters\nI think that they want cap and not to be investigated by a Democratic Congress which\nThey're willing to vote Democrat in the first place and so I was talking to some operative today are trying to help Democrats keep the Senate or take back the Senate which is going to be a struggle and they were saying they feel like enthusiasm factors leading their way despite conventional political wisdom\nThat the Senate pretty much in Republican hands they pointed to the call and said no I I think we're going to get a lot of our people out to the states like North Dakota Indiana Missouri in West Virginia\nEmily you as a Supreme Court watcher obviously followed the governor out here in St closely what do you think it means if these numbers are accurate we're seeing\n... still more unpopular than popular but an indication that Republican turnout might be higher next month as a result of the whole thing for some reason that amber just said\nWhen I'm curious though from you is do you think this has anything larger about the American people's feelings about the me too movement generally we're just about this highly partisan standoff\nOh it's this is at more evidence of division rights and the reason it's matters politically is that\nThe Senate is not doesn't reflect majority opinion and a lot of it it all over on America and so we're looking at results in particular states mostly red states where Democrats had an uphill battle and so if Kavanaugh helped Republicans\nBecome more enthusiastic and increases turnout then it could have a disproportionate effect on the composition of the Senate and who wins\nThe house races on the other hand if on you know the vote goes up among Democrats and independents it will matter more there because those are\nRaces where on it's closer and there are there I'm more of a possibility for democratic gains I feel like the political implications are sort of confounding when you're trying to understand the effective cabin on on the whole country and yet always in the United states given our electrolysis done it's not\nThe national referendum on any particular question that matters that's how it plays out in specific election so I find the whole thing\nNot very satisfying as like a referendum on the me too movement because if you are just looking at that you would look at Kavanaugh's approval ratings and say they're down and that's what matters but that's not that how it's going to play out in the election\nAmber briefly any idea if the Senate Democrats are second guessing themselves about how they play the covenant blows it forward\nThis programming is Bronx you by the Texas secretary of state providing voters details on what approved forms of photo ID they can bring to the polls more at vote Texas dot Gov or eight hundred to five to vote\nToday on your NPR station news radiation [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to America on the line or news and call in shows out the term elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country Brian Lehrer infer Jonathan tonight\nAnd it's not just candidates on the ballot on election day there are more than a hundred fifty different ballot measures around the country these very so widely from state to state like from voters in Florida deciding whether people who have served their time for crimes can get their right to vote back\nLike they're doing many other states to voters in four states deciding whether to cover more working class people under Obama medicated which the Republican governors have declined to do to a proposal to repeal the sanctuary state law for undocumented immigrants in the progressive state of Oregon\nAnd the proposal to repeal transgender rights in the progressive state of Massachusetts to the states of Michigan in North Dakota deciding whether to become\nRecreational marijuana states to Colorado's measure that would repeal believe it or not slavery as illegal form of punishment for certain criminal act though it was never taken off the books\nIn the centennial state which by the way that's Colorado's nickname because it became a state a hundred years after the declaration of independence the centennial state so we'll talk about some of the most important and interesting ones now but here's something else to keep in mind\nSome ballot questions or put there because they helped drive voter turnout in one party or another and that helps the candidates\nLike it was widely believed that George W. Bush won re election in very close two thousand four presidential elections because Republicans put an anti gay marriage question on the ballot and the ultimate swing state a year of Ohio\nHunting has really seemed to be the most contentious aspect of this\nWe have Tar Heel Barbara back on the line I think ... Hi Barbara\nSign that that sorry about that so go ahead what do you think of us\nSo I just wanted to say that this is one of six constitutional amendments that are a Republican super majority has put on the on the ballot because they're very concerned um that that\nMajority might actually be broken and this one I mean it has a nice sound kill it like yes we should keep those kind of national puppies statewide popular pastime I'm protected but what people are concerned about it and it's going to keep\nThe state from being able to for example keep people from engaging in a poisoning different kinds of animals that it's going to allow for constitutional found us to really reasonable environmental protection and also that might end up being just kind of a burden for for like\nFake commercial interests so for if we tried to do something to stop over\n... saying that it was not going to actually help kind of the hobbyist but really big business and ... and I really agree with your\nSpeaker said that it's it's it's clear that they that Republicans are worried about it and does he have them go but the polls and said this is this is just designed to to drive up a conservative turnout so\nFar but thanks for for all of that on the left observation and you brought it up to Canada is a ballot measure that's designed really to gin up turn out on behalf of candidates or I mentioned earlier in the show how that was used to great effect and the two thousand four presidential election year\nIn Ohio where conservatives put an anti gay marriage referendum on the ballot that drove conservative turnout and George W. Bush won reelection by a hair that year because we won the ultimate swing state of Ohio by a hair that year with all that extra Republican turnout\nThat people believe the ballot question generated are you seeing that anywhere else in particular\nYou mean in a in terms of kind of using one issue to to get at the other yeah I personally have not seen that so much in in any of the ones that I've covered but\nAnd of course a advocates of this right to hunt measure say that that's not the case then even if that is the case\nWhat's the harm in having more voters at the polls [laughter] you know\nLet me get a couple of more um callers in here from around the country coffee in the Bronx was ballot measure you're following\nWell actually I'm calling regarding the ballot initiatives in Massachusetts it's\nWorth saying yes on one which the ballot initiative in Massachusetts driven by put on the ballot fi I'm an effort from the Massachusetts nurses association and the nurses in Massachusetts trying to have legal um standards for staffing\nWhere hospitals so look for a minimum nurse to patient ratio for hospitals for the sake of ... right\nYeah California's the only state that has this and Massachusetts would not be the second\nNurses' union most likely to\nWhile the nurses' union is the is the prime driver behind this year because staffing is just an on a legally you can have um\nLimits only in ICU patients so nurse has maybe one to two critical patience for that patient goes to the floor the nurse now it's taking taking care of six to eight sometimes can\nAnd I know I'd rather stay steps that say patients do better when there are at least the minimum number of nurses are per floor and suing the neatest Springs Florida are going to get to do the last one so we got Fifteen seconds for your heart\nYes yes I Am in favor of voting yes on proposition Thirteen to ban greyhound racing and the state of Florida because of the abuse of the animals they guy they separate injuries so I'm a ... vote yes on proposition Thirteen\nThank you very much too in ...

fathers look after the offspring\nIn the world of models that their conception that it's over to the moms\nBut very few of those ... those develop close paternal relations with the young scientists studying the mountain gorillas of Rwanda\nSay the males are close I'm active fathers and the more ... father does the more females want to have children when when used up to Stacy Rosenbaum of Northwestern University in Chicago\nSo what we found is that the males who spent the most time what we call affiliating which in this particular case means grooming and resting in contact\nWith the instance in their group are also the males who ended up firing the most and fats and this was definitely not something we expected this is not a monogamous feces the mail and don't seem to discriminate between their infants and the influence of other males are and yet in spite of that it appears that it may have some sort of benefit for them\nThat so what you're speculation is that the more ... tunnel the guerilla is the more females choose to mate with a gorilla\nYes so that's our speculation we can't prove causation yet um we are working are coming up with some ideas to try to test a alternative possibilities for this but right now we think that the most plausible explanation is that the females prefer to mate with those males in particular\nUm why wouldn't they because they want to help us I mean that's the kind of like a rather blunt sort of I suppose a human way of looking at it but what could be the Russians do they look ... do they know to the bone in between the father and the child does the father only bummed with his own child will just she bummed with more children in the guerilla group\nShe doesn't seem to bond only with his own kids so we published a paper a couple of years ago that showed that they don't seem to discriminate between their infants and other males and fence\nIt's hard for me to believe that the mothers don't notice that you know they they pay attention to what's going on around them um we don't know exactly why female should prefer this ... where it's not exactly clear what nailed care is getting them\nBut what we're speculating right now is that perhaps this is basically a signal that males are giving to females that when they meet arises for them to do something really important like protect an infant that they're willing to do it and this is how they show females that one\nThing I'm I'm intrigued by is the the mothers will obviously be involved in specifically maternal I imagine cycling ... kind of thing when we when we say that the males have a strong paternal row\nHouse strongly that or they just like washing the dishes once a month kind of thing [laughter]\nSo what are the things is very striking when you study mountain gorillas anytime you are around males you were also around infants so from the time that instance art all old enough to be moving around independently from their mothers\nMales adult males specifically are seem to be there are other preferred adult companion\nSo males do a lot of um what we have colloquially call babysitting or in the literature but they also do a lot of behaviors like playing with them wrestling with them grooming them a resting and contact which is basically the equivalent to sort of sitting on somebody's lap if you're a human um are sitting right next to someone on a couch\nI'm you know certainly the amount of care taking that they do is nothing compared to the females but again for a mammal it's incredibly unusual and it's really hard not to watch this behavior and to see something in it that looks a lot like what we see in humans or\nButs was going to be my last question when you will that watching in the wild obviously you're watching as a scientist but surely some of you is sort of tracking across some thinking\nIn human terms what this would be look like what this would look like I mean you mentioned sitting on the sofa does it sometimes look to you that they are sitting side by side on the sofa or sitting in dad's lap\nAbsolutely yes it is impossible you know yes of course you're you're a scientist and you're trying to be as objective about this as you can but you know you wouldn't be human if you didn't see some sort of parallel and it really does look like the sorts of you relationships that you see between many fathers and their children\nAnd that's why ... amazing not the best ads in the in the world pretty good data that amazingly would humans and you can almost a

without a ... party political background or they consisted of advertisements though it's really played an important grove\nForties newspapers and a more over did vote is perfectly normal at that time in Vienna to buy an article in the new section so this means that promotion of text book published like news in the form of news um without labeling it\nSo he was writing against the commercialization in ... and the corruption as he put it all the newspapers and and I mean today people often cool call corrupt himself a generalist but his was a very particular type of journalism\nAnd he was in a unique position and he was able to edit and publish his other magazine de facto which means the torch\nIt ran for thirty seven years it totaled nine hundred and twenty two additions is about six million woods and the editorial independence they hadn't been he was not beholden to any special interests be they political or commercial but tell me she won't how unique was crosses independence\nWell just a hug both um ... financially independent because he inherited a lot of money from his wealthy father on Austrian Jewish papal ... cold um y'all could cause\nThese means that ... did not have to ride for another paper they didn't have to become a traditional journalist and get paid for delivering news so to save for a newspaper but apart from these financial independence I think it's more important to emphasize\nThat cows both really independent in an ideological a sense of what I mean is that he both never really ideological if you understand\nThis tone up by I'm thinking about people who are totally fixed into political ... views so he in this sense in this political sense he votes never ideological at all\nAnd I suppose when you took to the hidden being ideological in a sense that does that\nReflects hidden sometimes seeming contradictory as well I think an end to be fat when he was doing wasn't vanity publishing the the magazine often sold between thirty and forty thousand companies ... and and it typically shocked toned sentence Crouse commented on ... plus as\nI my public understand each other very well it does not hear what I say and I don't say what it wants to hear [noise]\nNow ... study publishing de facto in Eighteen Ninety nine of the spin of working as an actor and a journalist other publications I'm Ari tell me what was he playing

read something in the newspaper one was not reading\nNews as for cross it sort of ought to be delivered um these are not agents of information is cross I think things that are thought that a journalist should be\nRather individuals that were beholden to various political and economic interests and yet this was often disavowed or at least not made explicit and so you know one of crosses\nConstant targets of critique I could say the if the inherent sort of put city of journalistic language the way it claims to have some kind of independence\nBut really when pressed or when exposed in different ways shows itself to be either ideological are motivated by economic interests or a more dubious political and that that were not made obvious to the public and so that's certainly one of the main areas of of uh of concern that cross expressed in his writing\nAnd ... and just to be clear in nearly as difficult published not just a cross but also on the original writers from Vienna and beyond but from about Nineteen twelve grouse basically divided the contents of the magazine himself\nI no longer have collaborators I used to be envious of they repel lose readers who might want to lose myself\nCross was less interested in in breaking news stories than in commenting on what others have written as we've got mentioned already he would find a piece of a pool report seeing all sloppy language you sort of human folly independent articles of the time\nAnd then you take it upon through satirical comments he would often stop by exposing it's absurdity all by simply ... printing the only thing\nHere is an example ... new advertisement wanted\nA father in law to go into the women's\nBusiness with me I'm twenty three years old and will know who knows the women's west salesman no matchmaking\nAnd that there was no mention of the bride and the advertisers who and there were a lot of serious political economic and social issues that the un and the rest of your face of the time so to cross it seem ludicrous that the papers that they would waste column inches and reporters time on mindless entertainment such as this one\nYesterday's competition dumb fellow who saw the first prize go to ... Lewis come from the smallest foot to have ... prizes will be awarded today for the narrowest ladies waist and the biggest knows\n[laughter] so it would seem to promote his victim now a century on from when ... ... there's not much has changed when it comes to the trivia and celebrity ... and it seems like a professor remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real truth of those that can be invented\nAnd controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes to mind\nAnd one can only imagine what he just sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on the ... the language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic pure as someone who only sought models of language and figures like Shakespeare to ensure there are many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um the image is as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In a relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so one wrote ... and I think are writing slop ally and crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a combat due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely\nOr one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing as he is exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in the heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and these other schools are fully delusions two classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you said and he also continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of the truth of principle you've heard a few of these already\nAnd ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book form several times\nBut he himself was also wet the limitations\nYou know we already talked about how he thought that at the press destroyed imagination and he was one of the people who really tried to imagine what would happen and from the first days on he knew that would mean death and and suffering instruction\nAnd I think he was kind of shocked to see people celebrating and thinking this will be ... nothing much will happen\nHe did at first ... probably also hoping that it wouldn't last too long and maybe it yeah it would ...\nAnd ... and I think he needed some time to find a position for which to speak because of course they didn't and so easy the whole nation is celebrating its putting the when you're thinking ... [laughter]\nSo he had first declared that he would be silent he would just remain silent and not say anything to sound that time I did not last very long and only a few months later cross already decided that he would publish defiantly again that that he would take a stance against their will\nCross also thought that the press was implicated in starting the war how is the will rule didn't lead to well diplomats slice of journalists and believe these lives when they see them in print\nSimone that's a general observation but what will cross his main objections to the way that the Austrian press was reporting on the wall\nFull house to vote for both Maine to an amplifier and all the problems of modernity and the same is true for the press or the ... the press problem and this problem for coal is lost from the beginning\nThat the press is not reporting they are not reporting fix they are not establishing fixed but they are spreading opinions moods rumors\nAnd yes it was particularly skating wasn't the of some of the ... the war reporters who instead of concentrating on ... says he sort of ... soldiers inane questions and in fact here is how cross immortalized one such ... in his play the last days of mankind\nAlso\nPutting them on the flight of state [noise]\nHow ... makes his report why\nI Am with the fever experience\nThinking about what are your feelings on there [noise]\nAnd that's from a radio version of the last days of mankind dramatized by Giles half ago [noise] um\nCrafts began writing the play and about Nineteen Fifteen and it turned out to be a mammoth undertaking some seven hundred pages whereabouts ten evening's performance is\nReally it's possible to give a show somebody or something so long and complex but but I Would tell me get an idea of what what ... trying to do here and how he's doing it\nIt's important that probably first emphasize that nearly half of this play\nConsists although I don't think it's ever been determined the exact amount but nearly half consists of actual quotations that cross lifted from either newspapers or from conversations that he eventually overheard on the streets of Vienna or in the cafes where he spends his days\nAnd I say this because this fact has led to some commentators to call this play something of a documentary play which is not entirely an accurate description Kraus is definitely documenting the war in words we could say\nAnd in part because I'm Simone and Katrina have established the journalists who were supposed to be doing this we're not for the most part is cross thought they were swept up in the nationalist fervor that cross identified as something of a of a kind of collective pathology\nAnd so Kraus has um we could call them and alter ego in the play the grumble or\nWho maintains a running dialogue with his dialogue partner the optimist\nWho is presented as a much more naive figure than than a malicious figure 'em and and I say this because the optimist\nTends to be someone who kind of reproduces newspaper headlines and he takes their content at face value so he doesn't have really any critical dimension to his his audience is and this is precisely process point that what was counting or what constituted is healthy commonsense over which of course the newspaper editors held dominion\nWas the very problem and the play we could say puts on open display the actual motives of the war is cross saw them profit\nNationalistic muscle flexing techno mania we might call it an romantic ideology and this kind of mixture and cross would say you know the collusion between among these impulses is what led to and what perpetuated the war\nIf I could also maybe reduced the drama to another crucial insight and and as you said reducing this drama to any number of insights would be a kind of insult to the to the complexity and just to the massive undertaking that it was but it would be best that crosses\nAstonishment that an entire civilization appeared willing to destroy itself in part because of the new media technology so not only the press but in this case also film and photography which play roles in the in the play have made it actually possible to become a spectator to one's own ...\nDestruction and cross actually write something of this sort in the sort of the forward they actually even prior to the place prologue cross I Would say prefer to be a witness not a spectator\nSo we the way you could say it's kind of ... of the ... and they don't keep drama isn't it that that play I'm an old seat took about ... mania and as with so many things that can cause that's due to technology was complex\nHe likes the convenience of something like a ... but he also dislike the noise and the ... they created\nContradictions a would seem to be running through his his life there again he also felt that far too often technology was not being employed well and as far back as Nineteen oh wait he rose complicated enough to build machines and two primitive to make themselves\nAcross the ... bed of the war and the failures of humanity that it exposed as he observes the devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people mean\nOff the horror and ... of the war came the dissolution of the Austria Hungarian and planned this happened a hundred years ago in October and November of Nineteen Eighteen\nTell me what was ... reaction I mean after all his native country what his great no seed money still resigned as it became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to something Katrina said early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than probably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy has actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that cross as the war was dragging on especially the not only really anticipate the outcome of it was but that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what you saw was holy and moral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually ... who's the war on subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called the quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually nostalgic\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so crosses sort of again you know in his kind of enlightenment\nUm attack trying to connect the dots I'm Better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess the type of thing

thousand or ... thousand I'm In the country\nOkay I'm why do you think well I mean that that would look like the shelters are available are you saying that the homeless on not looked off to or don't

goes with a shelter is not the situation in Hungary\nI'm ... now I was just talking about their own numbers so even if a fire um if we don't talk about the quality of the ... and we just look at how many beds are there and not many people are sleeping out it is quite abuse that currently the shelters\nAre unable to accommodate everyone however I also think that the United nations society for most

mess before um who are who are sleeping\nRough right now why do you think the government's taking this ... this movie these as I understand that just a single line in in the statute that makes it illegal to sleep on the streets and why politically is the government doing this do you think\n[noise] um I think it is a little bit of mystery really um because ...\nUm industry is back on their significant ... the author of Hungarians thing that's one of those people should be held them support to eat and knock bunnies\nSo he's really not a society or which ones to criminalize homelessness if not even the police are I think the majority of what he's also think that the women ethnicities that social policies housing for the issue when he's the issue and not the policing issue if he's really adjusted the governments\nAre against a everyone who tends to work with homeless people\nDo naturally I see why our interests would collided this I just wanted to ask something I mean you said

profile journalist and had a strong connection\nWas Japanese bleach go world [noise] and when I went to a place\nBullies initially said well\nThese things happens a lot and\nRecon investigate and this is about men and women\nI was quite surprised that they didn't even start or even filed a case\nShe or he was this the first police officer that you spoke to\nIt was my first time to go to police and the port I was asking for a female police officer and they asked me why in the waiting room so I have to tell infant by everyone might have\nSo I have a starting to talk with this female police woman

go to the different PlayStation because the ants than what had happened was in a different era\nYeah so I have to talk to three police men\nTo start with [noise] it was very painful experience to tell the same story over and over and I remember when I first went to a place I was just crying and I couldn't even talk\nMuch us I start realizing that I had to repeat it in the tell my story I have to find their way to be able to tell this painful experience over and over and the way I guess I discovered to be able to\nTell is to think I'm reporting about one case and this had happened to this girl so I Try to think as a third party third person and I think that is how I mentally Monday she that\nNo sure east poses investigation you say you ought to act out what happened to you\nTell us about that\nYes so during the investigation they asked me to we enact and\nThey took me to one of the room and there were three male policemen around me and they asked me to lay down on the floor and\nThey start placing a life sized still me\nStopped taking photo and asking me was it like this was it like that it was someone I had to turn off my mine tried to not think about anything but it was quiet traumatic experience\nProsecutors drop your case on the grounds of insufficient evidence in July twenty sixteen in may twenty Seventeen that's ten months late to you and she decided to go public has to reveal your name and your face to the Japanese press y\nTo be honest what had happened to me was shocking but even what was more shocking was what I have to go through that afterwards going through this in the ... the un knocked meant and\nI start questioning about how little support we have here in Japan for a sex crime victims so in our apartment it was about time for them to talk about\nReformation of our rape though and I felt strongly that I Need to talk about what we need to change and also I discovered how difficult in how to boot to talk about rape\nItself in Japanese media and it was hard to\nTalk about my own story but um that was the only way I had left\nOh sure like to comes to ... to ... Japanese society in a moment but I say that ... she denies within occasions\nAnd you filed a civil case against him and miss him and Gucci is defending the civil case\nTouchy your case is very different what made you decide to find a lawsuit against you form of both in twenty sixteen\nShowing two thousand six cents sadly I was with ... from very high profile projects are in Georgia\nSo he was making sexual advances toward you yeah favors yeah sexual favors could you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you you know working within that environment\nSo Georgia societies like struggling with all this gender inequality and sexual misconduct and family side at fantasize that when women and girls are killed by men yeah so the second season in every environment is not a big deal\nSo she's tough person she's like ferry sexiest he\nWas always like commenting ... sexual comments\nFor me before realizing that this was very unfair\nEnvironment was quite normal I was just like ignoring calls his comments and trying to do my job because you know we all need to our job and we don't want to last job because this about economic a struggle we have in Georgia\nSo what made you then ... these comments and then decided to actually make a recording of him\nThis is because he was asking for thank him I said towards nuts comments anymore she was asking for sexual favors from me regarding guy was striking to lost my job\nSo they saw the last moment I realized I was in trouble they saw such kind of formulation and they're supposed to return so unfair\nSo tight just cruise notes being a silence and doing nothing so of course I denied it and I went to court civil rights cards\nSo he said if you didn't give him the sexual favors he framed in most of your job yeah and as I understand that the new news against sexual harassment in Georgia so how did you go about bringing this case decode\nYeah there's no particular like isolation against sexual misconduct tar as meant in Georgia but we have this odd to discriminate law where we have this part of sexual misconduct toward women\nSo with collaboration or calling Joe's we was ice case also my case or before me to campaign and that's for me to campaign each was kind of fly sink and ours is very sensitive institution so I could manage to was the case\nI Do believe that my story or presents hydrate so father women star race here in Georgia\nSo sometimes when I have a challenge to stay alive I Do think that I did the right\nThing to speak cop because there are lots of women who cannot speak up and they are to kink up to me and they are like praying for me to become survivor\nI'm not a victim and I feel like I'm a survivor because I could fight back\nSo me to come pay nice trying from my perspective to bring ... back to women\nAnd took it do you think things are evolving in Georgia all things changing it too yeah I Do\nI ... I think because we have high profile made the eye and political discussions here in Georgia about legislation second sexual\nHarassment and Sam aside and all these problems we have like women's issues in Georgia so I Do think that to me to campaign of was very influential\nNo totally in America but also in Georgia\nWhat would you like to see happen to test this one's a complete change you'd like to see happen what would that be first of all I Would\nLike to see the ... law against sexual harassment because I Know a lot of women has this problem in commercial secretary [noise] so this is number one problem we have to solve here in Georgia and holidays\nAnd jewelry what would you like to see happen in Japan\nThere are so many things that I should change sex without consent isn't right\nHere in Japan so to prove it was great we have to prove how much we been violated or threatened so that still it's remained and that it didn't change last year so that something has to change yeah same here in Georgia as well oh\nWow well I'd like to me who took about where you Korea's on now can I ... the fact that you knew longer working as a joined us was that a choice or was that something that happened because he couldn't find work anymore because he's spoken out\nI actually I could manage I was like oh totally discriminated on many drop into service and I can like feel he's hand everywhere this over ... that you're talking about yeah I'm Talking about him he's very influential men with contacts in government\nBut could you be sure that it was as a result of he influencing your ability to get a job was maybe not just because you can get the job\nI can say for sure and missing but it's this is my opinion about that\nAnd surely where are you now in your career you've written a book and you working outside of Japan for me the international media what are you hoping to do\nWhat I'm working on right now is to tell the story of\nIt's like to be a victim of rape [noise]\nSo I Wish to tell the story so they can understand and I especially here in Japan there's just a little understanding of what it's what can happen mentally\nPsychologically there if there is enough understanding for that part I don't think police would ask survivor too we and knocked\nIt took to it and they're you know we can you can paint and you're doing all these different things but do you feel that that incident that period of your life is now behind you\nI don't I'm Still fighting games the cards but I'm trying to type ...\nThe case\nIf it's possible and I'm trying to ... we can send these so house meals so in a way to feel safe because I feel I'm\nDoing something guy mean next year and so I can say that tech shows they stories behind me they saw us like very ... very humiliating experience\nBut I took a license from them and I'm trying to develop personnel into something not telling me for my carrier but also for other women in Georgia you have to be tied to how to carry they said to mess with you\nBut you do actually\nSpeaking out for both of you had considerable consequences to insects and all the backlash which you do it or they can cut you\nOff course of course I'll do it again and again every time I don't feel like it's my ...

out of the veterans and back into society\nWhich is helpful when we're trying to understand how well nice stone is doing but it's also about as much hard evidence as we have\nYeah I ... all the data they had to suggest that rental sister's actually walk and he said that ultimately every case is different and it's hard to generalize on a complex conditions like this [noise]\nI mean let's take a second hit something that I was intrigued about before we left for Japan is well it is about the country that makes a key ... such a large phenomenon that and why particularly is\nAnd a mom with an answer to that is professor and psychologist stomach you cite them from the University of ... Ninety minutes or so north east of turkey and he's the guy who wrote the defining book on ... back in Nineteen Ninety eight\nInjure boom a they're a very big gender\n... ... ... ...\nHe says the because of the patriarchal structure of Japanese society that's huge pressure on men to succeed some people just reject that completely and become very overwhelmed feeling like there isn't a place in society where they can just sit in\nAnd this is a social exclusion program in Japan\nBecause you're from there are ... ... homeless people these are very few number ... other countries but is that there are ... while medium history people are in Japan I think\nAnd uh this is a ... over social exclusion\nProfessor ... is one of those who thinks that the official government say goes underestimate the number of ... more in Japan\nSo you may or you may not have noticed that in fact you probably haven't but there is some things are you on the market these days about a certain kind of curve on a girl but threatening to bend the wrong way\nAnd that you inhale it just keeps getting flash went out that was not sane and about a decade\nAnd ... that's such a huge worry because it's probably a reflection of inflation expectations or anything\nWe mentioned the yield curve field for something that people are talking about it a lot I got to know where it is and what are the consequences are being above or below it that's really what where people are talking about the the slope and\nWhat state does drives the show and the cat and tens of the hills and what we see in the coming months with\nThe author of the way he said\nYeah you wonder why more people to to watch the financial media anyway well they told me about that have to give it its\nThe name is the bone geo kind of a tough measures the various interest rates you can get for different kinds of us bone market investments basically the kind of flattening out which is unusual and it's making some market watches pretty edgy why what is it is just in that gets to what he is co founder of seven investment management to explain\nHe's very simply actually occur which measures they yield over to a new guest on bones over a period of time\nSo it will be getting from say one week one month one year five years ten years and so therefore what it's telling you is how much that yields or to get to go up on this will be over that period of time and so you could measure although is he okay up we're going down and we would expect in a normal economic situation\nThat you get a ... on a ... a ball and then almost two year old would we would do would expect that as you would with and she went along she'll building Saudi will bank and said I'm going to give you my money for five years in ten years I'd expect to get a better return\nBut sometimes you can get the opposite occurring and she ends up going down the longer it is and that's why it's cold in the ... cup it's going the wrong way people get very interested in that because there's no ends up with some strange events they're often\nThey'll just strange some say the flattening or inventing ... it's pretty terrible in fact some experts reckon inversion deal cubs have successfully foreshadowed each of America's seven recessions over the last fifty years\nWell that's what some say any way others disagree the fact is it hasn't fully inverted yet unlike old economic indicators it may not be entirely infallible right now it seems downright implausible to some people the United states is enjoying record low unemployment high record high growth rates for the last decade so\nHow worried should we be his rust mold and economic acts but\nIt does give out false signals no rule is completely infallible if he was making money from financial markets will be eighty and it isn't that easy but I think the ... suggesting that the fed will continue to raise rates now\nBut that in the in in the traditional way it will overdo it it will do too much too late\nThat the U.S economy will begin to slow down\nAnd the and the future that would have to re cans instant cult interest rates and that's really what he's saying and I think if you do believe in the signal coming from from the yield curve right now what you're really thinking is it the U.S economy although he's doing Britain they now they see it as good as he gets\nUnder the Trump tax cuts came at the wrong time of the cycle putting juice into the system when he wasn't needed with the results that are on the world that's called ... debt now than ever is going to feel some some pain in the future and if you believe the the deal could that's what you'll frightened off\nRight so basically the U.S consumer will feel start to feel overloaded as those interest rates rise and the fed will lead you notice is after it's too late\nYeah not just the U.S consumer the consumer as an issue but I think it actually corporations they've taken a lot more that since two thousand and seven lots of it to form that was a ... a lot of it just formed share buybacks and dividends which you could use a little bit of financial engineering so I think if you are going to see a squeeze on actually think he might be that this time around\nTo the United states remains the weak point potentially in terms of the global economy\nI think at the moment it's the strongest point I mean we just had some numbers on what you're into the U.S economy has granted over four percent year along the lines basis but I think you could argue that he's the weakest link ... everybody so convinced he's going to stay that way and I think when you look at\nThat being so much higher than the walls inflation is just starts to creep up a little bit from ... points if you you've always got to be ... you'll most nervous when people are the most confident\nIt does seem counterintuitive though in a way of saying that the economy was doing best in the world of the world's develop Richard ... is the one that's the most vulnerable point\nI think he's ... he's funny because he was biggest economies was biggie stock market is the world's biggest market in homes the world's reserve currency and an if the U.S Federal Reserve does continue to raise interest rates\nOut ... I Know it's it's it's not a consensus view I think that would would give a potentially a boost to the U.S dollar and these things as a do go wrong and the rest of the world people will float in the ... so that the the Dole are going up will be will be a key feature\nThat in itself will make us exports less competitive and it will drain liquidity from the rest of the world so I'm not too worried about the U.S economy but looking at it through the U.S through financial markets what it means for stocks when he means occurrences if adult goes up that's generally sign that people are worried I cannot be negative sign for financial markets role\nRust mold well we'll look in more detail at some of the specific economic full costs in just a minute but first this is talk of invoke the cubs represent something of an opportunity\nFor us here on business day to look at other traditional indicators used by ... ... imminent change\nMaybe in a while and then the room [noise]\nYes the older the start to give off signals the experts tell us when times are about to get tough take this one example the sale of lipstick [noise]\n\nApparently some listen to sports at that as the economy tanks sales of lipstick head north supposedly is one fantasy items consume is still feel they can afford ... ... another telltale sign\nThe rise of a sudden specific type of crime [noise]\nTry to be precise

extortion [noise]\nYup kind of obvious this one champagne sales do spike joined the good times schools they do and then they nosedive if things get tight [noise]\nCompare that with a rather less intuitive but much more into discovery from them\nIt was back in the Nineteen twenties the U.S economists both going the hemline theory namely the women were an indication of rising economic confident

differently [noise] it was a former fed chairman Alan Greenspan who federally first notice the men by them so far fewer underpants tons of economic stress [noise]\n\nBetter some things that to some experts reckon for teller crush such arguments naturally lead to multi million dollar swings in public sentiment but can we trust any of them former presidential economic advisor now called person fessed up a mountain stream has written a book\nAbout economic signals she's called it well singles\nInflation is one were absolutely getting inflation now and the official data and most of the industrialized world and definitely across the emerging markets so you hear a lot of people who are very distressed about quickly rising rents about rising transportation costs personal pain caused by a higher cost of living\nI'll give you one more that I quite like I always say fashion and arts are wonderful place to pay attention to signals because they're so good at capturing like ice\nThe most popular trend in fashion right now is for trans parents translucent fabrics\nLace literally see through fabrics this is the rage and I really do think this reflects a societal demand for more transparency people are literally wearing clothes that reveal more in that effort that's a signal to me\nThat was a great Desmond Morris playing wasn't it the the the the the psychologist to the the

minds I think that that is of subjects the other day was wearing one of these on even headlines and I'm like if that isn't hedging your bets I don't know what that is I Want it both ways I think we're going to have a good economy and I'm not sure we're gonna have a good economy at all so we're we're both links\nTo what I mean we're in a well I mean we have been I think in the last decade ever since two thousand and eight of everybody's sporting bubbles and crushes almost around every corner and I mean it's just been almost ... ... if there was none of that and there was almost none of that before two thousand and it has been almost nothing found since two thousand and eight right yeah\nSo I said well what's wrong with him why that is neat come over and asked me\nThat guy in the corner is than Elon looks over in stand is cute but he's not her type too drunk for one thing\nHis friend says to him this is the girl we've picked out for you and he said to me I can do better and I
