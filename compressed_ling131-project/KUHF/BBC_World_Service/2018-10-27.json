{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "And the potential ramifications of what this charge language can be we'll just in the last forty eight hours just as a reminder we do tape this on Thursday mornings\nThere's been a rash of of bomb scares for leading democratic ah politicians across the country there's a lot of tensions surrounding this and all of there's been a lot of accusations that the the language surrounding and coming out of our electoral process our political process is contributing to\nSort of this type of action did this crazy action\nYou know it's maybe not surprising but certainly saddening to see that this has come to this we don't exactly know what the intention of the person who sent these packages is it's clearly\nThe fact that they're arranged in some way now the White House and Republicans have condemned this and the president has sort of suggested that he thinks that this is not appropriate and has decried the political violence but of course on the other side of the Democrats are saying that\nYour words are hollow because you've done specific things which have encouraged these kinds of violent action so\nThere's definitely I think a kind of friction at this and it's going to be I think a lot of back and forth that Democrats have been accused of um essentially inciting much of this themselves right Senator Cruz actually suggested that perhaps the fact that the Democrats are to blame for this but it's impossible to know I think because this could be the work of just one\nDeranged person but it certainly is a political argument that\nCrews and others want to make that the Democrats are sort of activate in really\nUsing this as a kind of inciting a moment it's where it takes the filling out a taco because it looks like this is enough it's it's coming from both sides coming from everywhere so this is certainly the case that I think politically that it doesn't need to be an issue that needs to be solved and this needs to be ratcheted down\nFor me I think the interesting element of it has been that what you're seeing is sort of the larger political climate as a whole has just been so confrontational on both sides\nYes you're how you're certainly having Democrats engaging in sort of aggressive acts of civil disobedience and I'm not talking about the marching I'm Talking about\nYou know doing really sort of ... inappropriate things like stopping people from being able to eat their meal at a restaurant but but that pales in comparison to mailing explosive devices to uh to to elected officials so so\nSo I I I get that part of it but I just think I'm not sure how long we can sustain a situation\nWhere the president I state sort of throws kind of verbal pardon the expression verbal bombs all the time and that's essentially what you've had whether it's related to the press whether it's really just particular individuals now he's dialing down dramatically wouldn't just just in the last forty eight hours about\n'em at at sort of Trump's style rallies that he's been having but I'm not sure he can sustain that\nRight I think that's right and and it's I think it's a mental over here but it predates Trump right the politics of this sort of sorts have been bubbling for at least a decade so it's that the combination point and maybe we can pull back or maybe not\nA speaking of Trump or there have been some interesting new rules that they've put forth to alter the definition of what it means to have a gender so what's going on\nWhat what what the ... tried to do is is effectively kind of wipe out the concept of transgender people I'm deeply troubling because essentially what he's saying is it that you are what you are male or female that's a permanent\nPermit thing it would apply to title nine that would sort of sassy preventing transgender people from competing met in inter collegiate sports levels and and\nDealing with this sort of getting short protections along those lines yeah so it's it's hugely problematic it essentially we talked about before strips away Obama era reforms and regulations that were put in place\nWhat makes it more troubling is the way the Trump administration's approach it and essentially permanently ... as opposed to played placing it and I sort of an executive order system which is what Obama had\nDone yeah this is an interesting ramification to the victory for Donald Trump right we talk about elections a lot more than talk a lot about what this mid term will mean but this is really were a lot of the power and government is that's the administrative state so a small rural change here in terms of what defines gender is going to happen\nBig impact on a lot of people so this is something that is worth watching given that it's small in scope and people don't usually pay attention to it right is going to be swamp ... election news and all of the changes that we're going to see but this is the kind of thing that has a real impact on the way the policies are implemented\nWell it's weird to me because the president had talked about you know you know protecting people were from the ... community during the campaign has actually said that on the er during his acceptance speech\nYeah for the Republican nomination what I suspect is this is you know we're in the middle of the midterms this is a way once again to rile up the base of the Republican Party to get him to come out you know they're they're searching in many ways for items to show the Republican base to Donald Trump is in fact day\nOf a social conservative movement conservatives as much as he is a a nationalist conservative as he is now to find himself fast so I think is just fits into that brand of what\nThe news you know we talk about the midterms but one of the elements that the president is saying this races about these midterms about it's not just about cabinet now it's about the caravan right\nThe president United States is saying that a caravan of individuals from Central America fleeing violence and searching for economic freedom are coming to the United states and they are coming to get you Brandon running out I guess you\nRight now and the president also implied that\nMixing in with this migrant group is are criminals and quote unknown middle Easterners so you gotta watch out for those unknown Middle Eastern and I don't know if it's not even it's not even a conspiracy theory from like the Nineteen nineties dislike from the Fifteen nineties right the sort of you know gypsy you sort of\nOut there to get you and I had a great analogy that's like so they use the scare kids and Halloween right\nThe facts I think as you say are definitely politically relevant right you've got about two thousand migrants who are in a sort of mass caravan who are migrating are way they say to the U.S this is an easy dog whistle for Republicans to use to try to gin up the support for their\nVotes in the mid term and I don't know if it'll have a dramatic effect because I think a lot of this is ready bake them but if there are worries that Republicans weren't going to come out to vote because there wasn't like as much enthusiasm especially comparisons Democrats than I think this is the one issue that might make it happen my favor Trump line though Jay I'm going to say the all time\nAs occurred in the context of this and here's what the president said after admitting to there were four reporters who are as any with him in the oval office that there was no evidence to support the claim that this was happening he said the following quote\nThere is no proof of anything but there could very well be [laughter] I'm going to use that I'm not necessarily their house residence he doesn't say much we don't really know that there could be prefer there could be said look\nIt would be like you know it would be inconceivable if there weren't some people of Middle Eastern descent in the crowd again it's a lot of dog whistle stuff and so it's hard to know\nSort of fact from fiction here but these kinds of humanitarian crises do I think clearly rice level of of the political discourse that needs to be at the point where we deal with it so we'll see politically clearly it's the case of this\nIs going to be something that is riling up\nWell look there's a couple of things here and I agree with you on the politics of it I mean this is designed entirely to gin up the base not probably in in many ways unlike the ... the transgender regulations I my sense is is is that you've always had a situation\nAlmost an annual basis where you've had mass a sort of collected migration from Central America we know that's been happening\nHistorically what has what has happened is individuals have come to actual border a border crossings and then filed for asylum yeah\nThat's essential what will happen now not they're not going to be invading a coming across the border there are about twelve hundred miles away and there's fewer than five thousand of them many of them are women and children\nSo this notion that there's sort of an invading army I think that kind of rhetoric and she usually problematic but to me the larger question is just to defining if this this reminds me so much of when and twenty fourteen the critical issue\nIn in that mid term election was whether or not the president of United States in that case bronco bomber was going to be dealing with the the pending Ebola cry [laughter] remember that did you get a bowl offer yes there was like five Ebola cases in the country right one of them happened to be in Dallas but but\nThe thing that got me about it was I was thinking back on it is these are manufactured crises\nTwo two essential sort of jazz we say Gen up for political purposes yeah this works perfectly for the Republican base they want to talk about this but the Democrats they just want to talk about health care and all these other than an Trump I Want to talk about Trump drop their ...\nAnd we saw this play itself out Brandon at at the Trump rally ... we just had here in our and and where we are in Houston, Texas\nThey have to move the rally from a smaller arena to a bigger arena the Toyota Center Eighteen thousand people you had a tale giant kind of touches tailgate going on they had a live band kind of a festive atmosphere it was yeah president just went crazy town in his speech there was a lot\nOf like chest thumping rhetoric I we're it's called it the biggest amount of applause was to build the wall stuff which is still\nI think the tagline for many people who support the president which is surprising even in Texas where the wall is fairly controversial but he did as you say a lot of things to be able to try to knock down the Democrats enthusiasm including calling Beto O'Rourke a stove and cold bony\nHas also twenty three percent of people who have voted in elections in presidential but not in terms of twenty three percent that's really the question of why are they voting for work because\nThey liked the you know cut his job voting for cruise because they're reinvented and reinvest it in the partisan politics and Trump has made that happen\nI don't know maybe nobody knows but that's the question\nWell I mean I so let's unpack those numbers just a little bit I mean when you when we talk about the fact of the the the three point more differential and at least so far in terms of partisan differential that is significantly better than we've seen in any mid term in the last Fifteen Years for Democrats and\nSo at the very least while we can't say that you know we talk about we talk about the Democratic blue wave and stuff and whether it's gonna gonna\nCrash on the red wall of Texas\nWhere we do know is that the upsurge over the surge for voters for Democrats here is essentially kind of creating effect where it's making the ... the state more competitive and and I think for Democrats they should lose heart\nIf they lose a lots of lots and lots of statewide races in large part because I my sense is the margins are dramatically closing\nSo that while while twenty Eighteen may not show this is a legitimate Liam your bank being able to sort of cross the line we're entering and we talked about this before it to a two party state yeah and this might be the first time so\nWhen you start to see races under ten points under eight points sort of consistently the generic Democrat is within seven or eight\nThat is a massive shift two years ago Wendy Davis lost by Twenty one points to a to Greg Abbott ... even even got within ten points two years ago this rodent or four years ago rather\nIs there and it was abysmal at twenty percent then so it was just awful now this is completely almost the opposite a couple of more bright notes for Democrats you see a spike\nIn for time democratic voters in suburban counties so calling counties that example forty percent of Democrats who vote in the last four primaries voted versus forty percent of Republicans who voted last for the Republican primary so that doesn't county ... county Williamson county there was a spike\nIn democratic base vote so that could be along the lines of what you're saying there's also a spike in terms of ... votes Cameron County El Paso that will do county all have\nA ... increase or about nine to ten percent of voters who have no previous general or a primary history so there's been a swell there the likelihood is that the the folks in those counties are voting Democrat so there's a couple of brightness right in terms of the state wide now\nThe implications down ballot could be even more profound right these\nAreas connected districts were Democrats are proposing\nYeah it's it's interesting I mean we talked about the uh the surgeon individual counties El Paso counties Henri over over two days is already voted more\nThan they voted the entirety of the early period um ... we talked about you know work do you think I Would do yeah I Would assume that's a little bit of the home town but we're seeing is an every every county colon county which is not an urban county Amish seeing seeing record setting numbers\n... county as well as seeing record sending numbers over two hundred percent from from uh back from twenty fourteen\nDallas is at three hundred percent of what they normally vote in mid term so we're seeing it across the state we're on pace to basically be vote similarly to what we did in twenty sixteen which was which was the historical high watermark do we know that\nThere's all sort of a larger trend towards early voting any way that debt for front loading more votes and this is my question is is carry over into till election day or we just decided we're going to vote it all out now and just have a ... day or is that going to carry over ... and we're looking at probably something unprecedented\nYeah I think that's good you know do we see a change in demographics in the state we see more younger people voting early that's been a change you also see more females voting the difference in gender was pretty big to you've got fifty one percent who were female and you've got forty\nFive percent who are male so there are some changes here I think in terms of how we felt but you're right it could be a bit of a dead but look a lot can happen in the next couple of weeks and a spike in turn out for Democrats on E. bay which tend generally happens could mean the difference of merging in many of these races\nAre so brand on a ledge ask you what do you think's going to happen on a day we've seen we've seen week one of of early vote without I guess another week or closer another five six days left what's gonna happen in these next five or six what's gonna happen\nAny day I think it's going to be a presidential level numbers maybe not quite that high because there are differences in terms of counties but I Do think we're going to see big turnout and that big turnout I think that if it's Democrats\nYeah I think so too I mean one one number to me that the jumped out I'm back in twenty fourteen only about seven percent of voters were between Eighteen and thirty five this time it's approaching Fifteen and a half percent that to me is is nothing more than Beto O'Rourke he you're obviously seen on President interest and it's making a difference\nJust persuasion is one thing motivation and mobilization to another so we'll see if the Democrats are good at that if Iraq is how well that's it for this week party politics is recording a

I asked him if this summit latest of many on Syria will be different\nIt could be different because it doesn't involve the un it doesn't involve the United states this is taking us on a different route\nBecause France and Germany have agreed to meet with turkey and Russia and normally we've seen the Sochi group which was turkey Iran Russia\nMeeting alone without the blessing of the un without the U.S in order to try to coordinate affairs in Syria\nHere Europeans are getting involved\nAnd this is going to serve as a counterweight for Turkish president air to one against Russia and Syria\nTurkey has three and a half million refugees it wants them to go back to Syria the United states is dedicated to keeping our core in the hopes that he will be forced out of power eventually\nTurkey and Europe don't want to wait forever for these refugees to go home they need to rebuild Syria Turkey needs European out in stabilizing ... getting those refugees back home\nThe United states is not as concerned about refugees as Europe is\nWe still have countries with diametrically opposed interest meeting here and all those three of them are very concerned about refugees Russia's suddenly isn't\nWell Russia is very concerned about helping Syria rebuild and making it an economically viable state which will solidify oxides rule and ultimately justify Russia's intervention\nIn this war and so we need to get Europe involved in rebuilding Syria\nAnd so far the policy of the west has been to stay out of Syria not to participate in the United states has put intense pressure on all the international organizations where there's the UN or the world bank\nNot to be involved in any rebuilding activities Syria\nIn the hope that these increased sanctions and a boycott of Syria will force are thought to buckle in to a UN led process of elections and ultimately his departure\nThere is a fairly thinly disguised pivot towards the spoils of war now that the war is more or less perceived to be coming to an end and it's interesting isn't it to us seems to be looked down at that\nWell it does and this comes on the heels of the great a barrel of United States Maine partner in the middle east which is Saudi Arabia of course and the ... affair has underlined in a sense the weakness of America's position\nAnd so it isn't completely surprising that at this point turkey is reaching out it's using the strength of its recent efforts against Saudi Arabia to reach out to Europe and Europe is quite fed up with the United states in many ways not only because America unilaterally broke the agreement with Iran\nAnd has been pushing Palestinians to the curb but also it's been going its own way in the middle east and to a certain extent Europe in this way can

crook whose book is fascinating stuff she ended up marrying a Jewish man in New York by the way thoughts on that suit black\nIts its signs incredibly interesting it's not a book that I've read but it is certainly one that I'd want to ... a couple of really really important things that I think a right to the heart of this is\nWhat she's writing about it is a a format that isn't the normal perspective that you hear associated with war you you tend to\nAbout the second World War in particular you tend to have tax ... those who were fighting or those who\nWe're performing criminal acts are those who were the victims what you don't hear so much a bunch of those people who are the generations beyond that are still living in the echoes of that time and it's a perspective that I think is really important for this generation in particular\nBut certainly as noticed sad for those generations that are coming as well\nAnd the second thing that she said that it really struck come with me is this concept of guilt\nAnd shame and the fact that guilt and shame if something that we tend to think is incredibly personal but she was talking there about\nShame at the human level and we saw that certainly when we were working in Kosovo that feeling of shame and guilt that in this day and age we can still do these kinds of things to our fellow men\nAnd then the national shame and then down one she actually goes into the backgrounds of her family picking up and what is her personal shame and her personal guilt even though she was not responsible that echo still carries on like ripples an opponent into subsequent generations\nCell fairly quick thoughts on that\nBut I think there are many lessons that I think um I think to some describe then he's the the the interesting aspects of this to me I think the\nOne thing that we know Jim and should do is to go beyond the guilt and shame and learn lessons for the rest of us um Germany will this story brings out a very important point that in Germany a huge number of people if not the majority of Germans were radicalized\nA and radicalized in a very powerful endangers waiting for a short time and there are lessons

G robots money is the deputy executive director of the New York based committee to protect journalists\nWe asked him on this program when news of his death ... three weeks ago when he made of the story and I asked him now you've hit on dissipated what the story would become\nSuddenly not it's turned into an enormous wealth story out of the interest is still a part of the reason for that is just the sheer horror of the crime and the fact that the Turks are letting out information little by little which is keeping up the level of interest but I think it's just\nThe sheer brutality of the crime and the details of our him perhaps being dismembered and one of the\nTeam of assassins that was flown from Saudi Arabia to turkey\nComing with the bones so all this is captured I think the public imagination\nWhat does it tell us overall about attitudes towards ... by Saudi Arabia\n[noise] it tells us that there is absolutely no tolerance on the part of the government or the royal family of critical for independent journalists [noise]\nThis is something that we knew we saw it last year when Jim Alka show she went into exile in to the United states because he couldn't report as you wanted to report and say things that he saw but it shows that if you do that if you go overseas the Saudi regime can come after you\nOther Saudi journalists in jail now do you want to highlight what's happening\n[noise] yes there were very few Saturday journalists in jail for many years the journalist knew where the red lines were in the kingdom what they could say and what they called to say but then I started to grow in recent years and last year the committee to protect journalists and its annual census\nHad seven journalists behind bars as all of the end of last year and that is ... has doubled as far as we can see there are not rich or teen that's not including those that have had to flee so there is an ongoing cracked down on the independent press in Saudi Arabia what\nIs the red line that you talk about the Saudi critics of the government and to what extent for instance I it's not much talked about now did Mr ... jeep cross said what exactly did he writes\nThe red line was that you did not write about members of the family you did not touch\nPower there were a few journalists who got into trouble for writing about protests in eastern province in Saudi Arabia\nWriting about the Shia minority in Saudi Arabia but mainstream journalist avoided those subjects and on the whole they were okay but what happened was that the crown prince started to portray an image of himself overseas as a reformer\nBoth a social reformer and an economic reform\nAnd mystic er shows it was part of the Saudi establishment\nHe knew what was going on he had served as a government aid so when he spoke he was speaking from knowledge and he started to poke holes in the story that the crown prince was paying publicist and a lobbyist to portray in the west\nDo you think he'd sold at one point that he could get away with a little more criticism because of the way the Saudi crown prince was portraying himself as you said as a reformer\nI think he did but he was aware also that they wanted him to be quiet even when he was overseas and he talked himself about attempts to lure him back to the kingdom\nHe was told he would be given a job and they wanted him to come back but he saw through that too and he told friends and colleagues that if you went back he was sure he would be jailed I Can't imagine however that he thought that he was going to be tortured inside the Saturday diplomatic mission and took\nThere is a certain irony isn't a in President at a wine of turkey setting himself up as the champion of this journalist he's he's not much of a champion of

over Seventy journalist in Turkey in jail and president at all on has proven to be totally intolerant of any kind of independent journalism and there's basically cracked down on what was a very vibrant price so it is ironic that a man who has no love for journalists\nShould be that concerned about the fate of one Saudi Arabian journalist\nRobots money from the committee to protect journalists based in New York\nOr sue we're going to talk about this case from a forensic science point of view in a moment fuss I sell mistake ... fiance said we were posted just to any of that she didn't believe in sincerity of Donald Trump and getting to the Baltimore busy she writes you think\nWell I think Mr Trump has made it up to be clear that um well she's not just pretty happy about this or they should be in severe consequences because he's driving policies to contain the arms trade we'd Saudi Arabia\nHow much is he in the know about this case there were reports I think on CNN that um have CIA representative who speaks fluent Turkish is a good the alleged tape of the ... killing this man [noise]\nWell it's very difficult to know how much I'm Mr Trump news about things in it and how much he believes them but a a report if the ripples the truth that she has said that she has ...\nTo um I'm not sure that that has made a huge difference there has been a change of tone from him he's been increasing the critical of the regime in has almost ... most recent before the remains to be a dent or to be identified and returned\nNow a ... it's very interesting and I think to have a a very interesting comment on this but the the body has almost certainly the location of the body must be known to the southeast because they have the people who allegedly did this\nI think they're trying to take as much time as possible\nTo prevent a or reduce the likelihood of ah the bodies um uh uh if you're like evidence being identified ticket publicly because that will do more than anything else is consume the a horrible way this man was treated\nAnd it will be the best evidence of the horrific nature of this regime in terms of how it deals with people that he doesn't agree with the vengeful nature of their their attitude\nOn the crown prince being tasked by the king of Saudi Arabia to overhaul the security services realistic in any way\nI don't think so I think that uh the these are all these ... very carefully thought out strategy you first element of their strategies to distance the crown prince from uh the these allegations of seconds to deflect blame on the agency and its members the the Eighteen month suspect team\nOr the third thing is to delay the discovery of the body so that the evidence comp beat that easily identified\nSuit black as a forensic scientists were going to let you lose some of the title of this case in a meal time for you you're listening\nOr anyone listening then perhaps now's the time just to take a break because the details can be a bit grizzly that saw health warning of the Turkish authorities sue recently such do well in the residents of the Saudi consul general what exactly will I be looking for\n[noise] well what we don't know em is the depths of well and that's extremely important and we also don't know necessarily what are the contents of the wealth or whether it is dry or whether it's wet\nCertainly in a in a lot of the war crimes situations we worked in in the past wells are viewed as being quite convenient places in which to conceal about eight partly because they're really difficult\nTo access the base of that well so if it's particularly deep then there will be issues of actually getting access to the remains if it is constantly flooded if there is Walter at a great that that again makes it more and more difficult\nThe ... the both of them if it's in Walter then it will start to decompose under one of the the great says uh enemies of identification whether that's identification of the individual or identification of the mechanism of the day\nIs in fact time and the composition and the fact that it's this men but presumably allegedly partly so um although there that are generally well there are several fairly well recognized reasons why people just member that the most common one is simply for the ease of transportation\nAll right ah do you understand people's instinctive er I'd disgusting too strong a word reaction against these photos they just don't like seeing dead animals held up as trophies\nBut they didn't like the last I think that's that's pretty much the u._k. situation is one of the things that's come out this week is the energy on St Louis has achieved a world consensus and are they\nAround the world people react the same way too she hung saying stories images whereas the hunting and saying you know go to concerts as we all different types of the way the Americans here hunting\nOr they will guys who Africa decorate their houses and that's that's a fair peace in Haiti that but generally speaking we judge or the Americans started understand all of a pheasant choosing I mean I've been hunting in China or they have a completely different today said that the Americans and also the Germans and the day\nDo you understand [noise] I I'm I'm thinking of that the hunting process you know you say that they you know this is an important job and and the Jews and overpopulation of these animals and lack of practices\nYou know that it's humane under some hunters ... you know he get them short wrong and hit an animal in the leg and then somewhere else will shoot it in the eye and its stock is on it you know this is not a scientific way of doing things that\nYou can never be perfect ties but all you can do is try very very hard but the thing is it's extremely difficult to get a a rifle license in the u._k. I was young you know we were all about the gun licenses hunting is very easy here throughout the rest of Europe is all about hunting license and it's quite easy to get hold of the guards\nUm so what we want to make sure that all the license or is it the most at risk in any way I kind of thing goes wrong I mean if ... if you have a lot of ... around the countryside or you're not doing something about that you'll be in or if there is still if as a safety issue\nThen you risk losing yo yo rifle license and that affected me as you go to go get a job doing something else\nI saw when I told you was doing a story about hunting you did a little bit of a rolling will [laughter]\nWill because it's one of those topics where I think they're all very strong feelings\nI'm a particularly against hunting a to point I think is being made is that I'm a it is very likely that most of these animals would have to be shot\n'em to call them and what we have here is some people in denial about the fact that uh for various reasons environmental otherwise we kill animals I'm now a several people who believe that's wrong on any concerns\nUh I think this isn't a topic where you can hold 'em provide a coherent argument it's an emotional issue\nAnd I think we should all agreed to them a inflicting unnecessary inhumane suffering is wrong under any circumstance but sadly we do have to kill animals in most cases\nSue black we've established that you're comfortable with dead thing you're also from I think you said your grandmother was from the west coast is going yeah right how do you what do you think about the ... of these photos [noise] I I think\nJustice as I said where there is an acceptance in the back of our minds somewhere\nThat animals may need to be killed under the argue that I see that they need to be killed because nature's nature but when we do\nThen it's appropriate that it's done in as humane interesting that we use the word humid in their humane way as possible what I think we're seeing in particular in relation to this case is the fact that it's the trophy home saying it's a humble turning the predator and then I think the extra thing on top of that\nWas the fact that this is a woman\nIn camouflage with high powered rifles owned UK soil and I think that's where the real shock because this has come in like an invasion to some in some ways I think it sounds innovation on different levels it's happening in our land we know that happens in our minds we know that there isn't a big business in hunting in terms of tourism\nBut to actually see it and to know it I think are two different things and when and what you see is this woman looking very confrontational in her camouflage with a high powered rifle I think that's what's really jarring to this story into the level that we're thinking about OK\nCharlie Jacoby on your show you couldn't make the same money ... from people paying to come and look at the wildlife through binoculars you know the magnificent bags of the west coast of Scotland even the wild goats would attract a crowd\nSo we are fortunately um because we also do that many that Iran is still feels that are on this already but as far as a lovely people do it but they are very very little money for it I think I mean I don't want\n'em in the whitening of the story on you but if you look at Africa when she got two kinds of countries in southern Africa and stuff all the wildlife witness which was hunting countries that when I moved here outside\nOf Africa in Zimbabwe wildlife losers which are the hunting countries are ... and as far as good as well as far as coming around to to allowing hunting again because unless you have hunting a trophy and saying you simply call into full it's out there on all around the place\nAnd I was a Jack of the I'm Sorry I have to have to end it there because we're coming up to the news Charlie Jacoby from the field sports channel on YouTube many thing because as we can\nGo next time being rediscovering contemplative practices with mirror by Bush who helped create Google Search inside yourself I'm Krista ... please join us\nSunday Morning at six o'clock on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven\nInvestigation continues into the suspicious packages ... critics President Trump will have the latest ulcer Russian trolls try to influence American by reading about what ball players kneel during the anthem\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people this is a pretty great subject\nSaturday on weekend edition from NPR News\nMorning at seven o'clock on used in public radio this is your NPR station Houston Public media news they eat seven ...

them bumps when he's in front of his supporters\nOf the Raleigh we perhaps here what he really thinks so today calling for America to unify the nation ending the politics of personal destruction he said that being a conversation about the tone and civility of political conversation which of course is up to looking true\nBut then he turns his attacks on the media suggesting that the media are trying to score political points against him\nThe U.S defense secretary James Mattis has told a major international security meeting in Bahrain the manager of the Saudi journalist Jamal has struck

many a haven techie somehow summit in Germany and it's been public pressure in both places for them to return home\nExtremist elemental as we would call it is now becoming very large\nUh and uh it's it's a summer we know that well it's it's well of course Mr Trump if he does represent and has exploited it has got pretty significant\nA following he has been elected and there is a chance that he would like to bike streaming well he's been elected by the right wing um people who are the treatments like she likes supporting so what we're what we're saying is that\nHe has harnessed these a right wing agendas um and he's supported\nThe other hand we do have to accept that there is a long gap between somebody who is an odd in support of President Trump and somebody who wants to spend bums his opponents\n... perhaps uh misunderstood you a question I thought you were talking about the extremist element but no yes the the wrong on mainstream Republicans who have nothing to do with the extremist the point of course is that\nMr Trump is I'm always tended to exploit to move to find some form of excuse whether it's deflecting blame on to the media\nThe if you go back to the Charlotte suitcase wherever I Am a the poor lady was killed by a a a an extremist I'm Mr Trump was careful to point out there who blames them both sides so there wasn't an isolation a issue here\nSo the point I'm making is a perhaps misunderstood you a question the point I'm making is that\n... he's always championed some of the causes that these people are all these speak care about and that's why this individual\nHas stickers all of these calls saying this is if you like ...\nI don't think that's a very dangerous thing and if Mr Trump wants to maintain he's central if you're like less extreme support base it would be good for him and his supporters iffy isolation himself from the extremist because there is a danger to the country\nThank you you're listening to weekend from the BBC will

million Syrian refugees more than any other country in the world does our correspondent Sarah rains ...\nJoins us now Sarah what is it that this summit is designed to achieve because it really is marking the conclusion of the wool if we're on a study isn't it [noise]\nWell I think it's perhaps mocking five button to press the outside that has a sense to me one this law suddenly that's how Russia has came at a tree ... portraying us and Russia of course his pocket they thought it was I think it was interesting about these talks is that composition of course that has said by\nThe president President at ... and stumbled on defending got close to the the venue itself a mindset on the banks of the\nBook but it's also take place but they also have your pin leaders at the table for the first time that the leaders of Germany and France and I think that reflects the fact that he wants to expand\nThat dialogue on on Syria on Russia but also\nRussia's interests and that the one hand a politician's European countries can mix it what it sees as a huge task of reconstruction\nIdol for the political process going forward for serious I think Russia is trying to move the dialogue feeling conflict to fill camp out the fourth it's Russia and Syria as much as possible but of course that is an extremely complex are full tuition or even now to Russia\nWants to share the rebuilding does it in a way wants to share the spoils of war it's interesting in that case that America's left out today [noise]\nI think that's a very glaring up so fast that I think it speaks to this new lines

issue of Russia refugees is one that\nDoes a concert and Europe as it does ... you mentioned the a huge number of of a Syrian refugees here in fact he's three and a half million but also many in Europe too and I think Russia is trying to talk about\nRetaining replicate to Syria at the normal life in a situation that and then looking for was the reconstruction secondly I disliked US military

Sarah\nRange but many Thanks This is the b._b._c. World Service [noise]\nEighteen minutes past the hour Francis Fukuyama made his name in Nineteen eighty nine with or provoke as if they titled essay the end of history question mark\nThe time western liberal democracy seemed to be winning out over communism and author of terrorism in the essay I'll give you the liberal democracy will be mankind final form of government to do stick by the way mostly tobacco idea his latest book\nTakes on the rise of populism it's called identity contemporary identity politics and the struggle for recognition says liberal democracy has been having a tough time since its peak in the early to thousands\nOr wife democracy I think it's good for the world and I think it's good for the people who live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats democracy will\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump\nThey think that he's finding that coup and uh\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy\nSo the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal park refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWhat linked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race\nThat people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of politics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't do\nYes I did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we fight Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know what I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book\nI'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what a liberal Californian view your day Nate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money\nYou know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people uh you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions\nAnd integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\nWeek the W. H. I. decide not to declare it to ... see but have said that they all still deeply concerned about the outbreak and the response needs to be intensified stuck\nTo having a tenant Rubio Iraq in the country three weeks ago to coordinate their response to the international federation if the red cross providing burials at a dignified yet safe engaging communities around risks and preventing the spread of infection in clinics\nEarlier this month to Red Cross well because when I left severely injured after an assault on stilts Rubio why anyone would want to attack them\nEven though this is not the first ... breaking Google that he's a lot of disinformation Amish information about the virus so when in these ugly happens in another area where it didn't happen before and the publisher and I'm not used to these\nOn one of the things that he's an important source of contamination are unsafe barrios which means when a person dies with a boiler nor the Monday the body are so high and low of ...\nAnd all the handling of the body is quite to the news for everyone\nWhich ... the buddy ... writes\nA a ... part of the look I tradition which makes that they touch the body mutts than we normally do for instance to saying I mean we're staying countries\nAnd that puts them in a real vendor so when they see that people coming after these deaths are occurring\nBut other than that they can do they read to us as they used to\nThat combine to the station that they have lost a little while ...\nEverything quite a difficult because they had ... are really crushing gangs that are ... and we've developed leaves\nAnd the health ministry in ... that at the weekend there was an incident where twenty two young people dug up to about ... backing came into contact with the ... do you know what happened down\nYeah in fact this is one of the programs that we are that getting because there are a lot of rumors going around about the ... on what the health workers\nAre doing to fight against it so one of the room ... that in fact the body bags are are in the hour that they'd be seized half being removed seven I don't know for the pirates or organs for lead toddlers are proceeding that said that are on the other reason\nThey did that was of course of what they told me that the the ... he was completely normal by the way that surrounds proposed a higher\nRisk for all of them to to get their values so for instance we have a room or fucking system to be updated from the blaze from to know whether the rumors that I really do about it I seen the nation under control of their own values\nOn to that can this are rumors that it could be through different that protests that we can eat it with even a social media said that um\nI guess it's difficult to build up trust between health workers and the local community and in a very short time in the way that things need to be done ...\n... it's quite this equal darn does why the red cross abilities worldwide through like volunteer who didn't get it on to\nTheir communities but despite of that it's a very difficult because as I said we are going from being new approach of doing things like for instance the ... say something to fade barrios both on ... ... they are used to do for the simple use me will say\nAnd it seems to be the case that amendment more children of becoming infected than adults do you know why that is [noise]\nFor that can be yeah so that our response or right now or the rainy season is just starting with ... ... in a number of my life ah cases on the scene thumbs on science off my maybe I can be confused with the ones from a of a boiler\nSo that he's supposed to be that the gym and I've not thought to Humphrey bought I bought the area so that means that for a few days the children are receiving a feeding into these look what they should be receiving\nAnd finally they up to make sure I have said that they are very concerned about the situation how worried are you about the containment if this outbreak do you think it will sprint\nWell unfortunately the vitals doesn't know about ... or board of theirs so we really need to take care of that because there are a number of unknown cases or cases that are coming from a known sources so\nIn that regards the ministry of health whether we W. H. O. they are doing now in terms of the nation from thing but it's it's concerning let's say and mainly for neighboring countries where there yet and that's what our borders and where the virus is a more difficult to the going thing\n... to ... and we'll keep you across the situation here on health check\nNow cleric couple of weeks ago we were talking about life expectancy is and how long people might live two in the future and ... but now it's a study looking way beyond that how long humans might live in the distant future\nAnd that's just next question of whether there is a natural limits to the human lifespan which we can never go beyond regardless of what medical advances may now this is a debate it's been going on ...\nOh yes because everybody's aware that life expectancy has been increasing for quite a long time and has always been this question I vote when it's going to stop and many people have thought well it's ...\nSo at some point and it's got to be some natural limit to what the human body is capable of so delighted study has come from quite surprising uncle they've looked at uh when we die and they look if you plant the age at which people are likely to die on a graph\nYou can see this time any one particular point in time a it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and then it did back down on the other side and a nice ... of\nI'm not a beautiful ballad cause has been shifting ... uh in people's lives of the century have progressed\nSo um it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if there were some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but it's not doing that\nSo you think I thought so we'll cluster often that you have I don't know loads and loads and loads of people dying eighty five Ninety exact amount not what's happening I\n... and it's not doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell us that uh than I can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that the cub will altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet um\nWhy should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways old fashioned replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on our body for instance maybe I'll ... just a destined to crumble after such an age old\nMaybe the race it which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discussed life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S ... down in the less than you might expect a lot of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and fifty people die from an opioid overdose\nThe people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health well because it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people on the city streets\nNot as a couple of weeks ago on the size of the homeless population is very visible next month voters will decide whether the city's biggest businesses many of them tech companies have goals should face a special tax to fund both more homeless shelters I'm more addiction centers like this one out of inventing the ripples [noise]\nI'm here at city hall and the center of San Francisco within yards of the buildings gleaming dome there clusters of homeless people huddled in doorways sprawled on pavement or slow the pace in the streets\nEvery week to berries evidence of this team walk the city streets to build a poor with homeless people with addiction problems and they offer on the spot treatment\nWas trusted established encourage patients to visit the city's public health clinic today there's a steady stream of homeless people [noise]\nJust have this clinic known as a home without health says her I mean James don't his real name from a medic in the U.S army recently started treatment for heroin addiction\nRight now I got a prescription Ridgefield ... a doctor who was also like the new shoulder but for a you know there are other things that can be [noise]\nJanitors therapy has been prescribed the pornography and to help him off his opioid addiction ... is a daily pill to reduce his op ed cravings and the extreme physical pain of withdrawal\nDespite being an addict for over ten years James wants to change\nThis medication ... century or I was I'm a ... to do is you toss a less painfully um and I are\nDo that for muscular demand shot or other diagnoses the improvement was more than for the assignments ones were you surprised\nThat we're not really be goes huts I'm married we know that it's a really really bad form of dementia that affects the old brain so we were in a way kind of expecting these\nKind of results I won't do you think it is about listening to someone reading aloud that's making a difference because it does seem extraordinary in a way that this could make a difference to memory well\nNot really because when you are actually listening to a story you're\nActually drunk fearing some of your memories in order to feel the holes that are in the story so let's let's do a little experiments if I ... I started reading you of someone waiting for his luggage you might visualize in your mind song I don't know maybe get ...\nOh yes ... stretch away I was thinking of an apple and I'm thinking of white thing and that they can that hasn't even started yet that\nThat what I mean so your brain works with some scripts and those groups you build these groups on the basis of your own memory basically it's back and forwards\nKind of process so the story give you some and but you feel these weeds your own memories so it's not really surprising actually\nAnd people seem interested in the stories that they were being read to people discuss them together\nYeah so beautifully I mean you're not allowed so there's a lot of variables coming in in in the experimentation but I can say that all those variables are actually three grids by the reading because you have something on which you can discuss with the others\nSo it might be that it's about\nHow narrative affects your brain and also the situation that comes up\nIn this kind of training you\nI'm with the kinds of differences that you saw in memory how important to all those all the difference is big enough to allow people with dementia to do something that hadn't been able to do for all to take power more in conversations\nAre well I don't know but let's say that you've before they couldn't actually remember at least of Maine's after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit of improvement\nBut the main improvement for me it's about out of your graphical memory\nSo once they start to to have a better memory and the ... for months even memory they started to their lives their own stories which is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least\nReaching the point in which you got to remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo what do you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these up an Indian many many different situation because it's a strong training it's a really good training and it was really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and everybody wouldn't most everybody we have a book in our house and someone who read to you\nDr Marco ... not plan this was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this is enough to slow down the process at the mentors that but it's it's really interesting\nIt was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because some with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just I'm from the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading to them and in fact she's already recommended by nice the official ah UK\nAnd they check guidelines buddy and that's one thing you can do with people with dementia is just try and get them more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and\nTrying to stimulate them a intellectually in any way you can\nJust reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other side of this happening down on with people with dementia things like singing all reminiscent therapy\nYes reminiscent therapy it sounds almost similar because in a way on it's getting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from that used and you you might use ... photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get him to talk about uh some of that very oldest memories and we do know that same people with dementia off and it is so very oldest memories to tell them like intact\nSo I guess with the lack of affected medication anything that might help people's memories if they've got to venture is going to be a good idea yes\nIt's understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot for dementia I mean there are some medicines that people can be given they tend to just I'm eve symptoms ... hops don't wet for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to set an not right for everybody so and that's why we're trying such unusual things now thank you\nVery much Wilson from Nissan test for coming in today and thanks ...

u._s. for instance when I was growing up in India and when I graduated I never even considered going to Europe\nThe U.S was the default destination not just for me but for all in my entire cohort I don't know anyone who actually went to Europe so what has happened in the last forty years that has restored Europe to become a global powerhouse of leading science area again and I'm In my opinion\nIs the ease with which people can interact and move across Europe of course funding as part of it the funding allows movement and allows collaboration\nBut I think mobility of people allows exchange of ideas exchange of expertise different ways of looking at problems and that's always been important for science\nIn point I mean you clearly being very mobile and you're in Korea so what is it the mobility brings to an individual scientists\nI think ability shakes you out of your little narrow ways of thinking and you're exposed to new ideas new ways of tackling problems and also when you meet people from different parts of the world and different cultures and so on it broadens your own mind that makes you more open\nAnd one's openness important it's important because\nReally new

bite you got to get a group of them and ... than sending all these five messages\nAs soon as the referendum results were announced I under our society argued very strongly that EU citizens here who are already here should be given a unilateral right to remain\nFrom the START I think he rama Christian and and his colleagues at the royal society the highest voice of science in the u._k. foresaw problems it\nTook two years but finally the government has said that regardless of what happens with the negotiations view citizens will be allowed to remain here\nBut the question of why you citizens fast particularly bad is because their situation was different from mine I came here on a work permit I had to apply for permission and then I came and then I had to apply for indefinitely to remain and apply for citizenship eventually\nBut when you citizen came here it was under the understanding that this was simply another part of the European home and suddenly they were told that one part of their home wasn't really their home at all and they were really outsiders and that psychological transition\nMust have been very hard but what we in the science community want to do is to make sure the conditions are such that they continue to be welcome here regardless of\nAny change in their legal status\nOne of the things I suppose most told the BBC earlier this week was the visa system we have is not fit for purpose I mean do you agree and all that sort of LA are you can point to\nAbsolutely I mean it is atrocious for example I hate to be anecdotal but I had a postdoc\nWhom I was hanging on a grant and on her own initiative she got a fellowship from the national institutes of health\nAnd the U.S because she's a U.S citizen and in doing so she said my lab a huge amount of money but because her funding source was different she had to change and apply for a new visa and because the procedure was so onerous she\nFell into a gap where her old visa was no longer valid and her new visa had not come through\nAnd she wasn't allowed to even enter the building she had to sit at home for several weeks twiddling their thumbs and Cambridge is completely outrageous the system has become more and more onerous for non you citizens\nAnd if we're going to apply that to everyone in the future of both you and non you we absolutely need a much better more streamlined efficient system\nThat advice about easy movement was reinforced by responses season Guthrie around Europe heard in that survey of international science sleep\nTo take he found these challenges problem for African Asian me sad to say that it's back to the fore and three times more likely to report challenges in getting that compact say European and north ... when did it for something that changed over time it's more difficult for me to say because I like a snapshot and the Saturday\nBut we did have some comments some me such as he expecting that these concerns that for example they attended\nA conference two segments that failed and making just because they wouldn't have been able to travel to the country\nAnd we had another ... said to his lacking in the u._k. face at the polling to see what obstacles we set up a lot of countries say the U.S Muslim ban it from a prominent example that my colleagues in South Africa and other ... similar obstacles that these sheets of discrimination bought as\nIt presents a problem for us because we can't really determine what these pieces are necessarily and it also brings up a question of why are there are so few of them this early on\nI mean how fish like oh the ... to be talking about would we recognize them very readily are being really to to try out a cold\nNo so they're actually pretty different so back during this time period most of them are armored they look more or less like clams shells with tails at one end and eyes like headlights at the other end\nWe would recognize them as fish because our concept of fish is pretty simple I mean any five year old kids raw fish but they wouldn't look anything like the kinds of rape and fishes that we're familiar with today which includes caught and trout\nUsed is even though you're saying that the fossil record is ... ... ... future for basically a lot of heavy statistics are the problem of how these things evolve\nAbsolutely so over that time period we had more than twenty seven hundred different records of different fossils found in different locations and because of the way fossils are preserved because they're preserved in the bottom in the sediment we can determine the environment both from the rock and chasing the fossil itself\nAnd also the invertebrates that we find there and so that gives us a lot of information about where we're actually seeing the fossils and we do see them and we can use this to reconstruct where their ancestors should have been\nSo they they were four hundred or so million years ago swimming around like ... the sink to the bottom of the ocean and you can recognize ... kind of stretching the walls from the safe being burden\nAbsolutely so sometimes we see corals buried along with them so we know they were at a reef sometimes we see that it's a river bottom than it has a classic river rocks and conglomerate\n... came ... this was the idea that there was some kind of environment that was more conducive to fish evolution than others\nYeah so the assumption from studies of modern fishes and studies of invertebrates is that everything sort of originates at coral reefs coral reefs are really complex they have a lot of life a lot of opportunities but in these earliest reefs we just weren't seeing anything that was recognized simply a fish that had bone\nAnd so the thought was well maybe it's just preservation of biased maybe they should be there or are they actually coming in somewhere else that explains both as bad record and their early evolutionary history\nAnd so what conclusion to become\nSo what we found is that vertebrates in fact just as the spotty fossil suggested were highly restricted to pretty much coastal waters\nWhat you would call lagoon if you went to a tropical island well ahead of the reef and that they continue to originate and diversify their for something like a hundred and twenty million years so every major group all the way up through sharks or own ancestors the bony fishes\nShows up in this really restricted habitat away from the reefs and basically anything else\nSo I mean how deep when you sing in title ... these are things\nBasically from the actual beach to about thirty meters at the most but well above say where wave action would be occurring during a heavy storm\nThat's absolutely true they go home ocean to search for a living like you know there was more ocean and members land a male just plugging as far as you can do to these coastal regions\nExactly and it's not to clear to us why they're doing that at this point it may be that there's more nutrients there
