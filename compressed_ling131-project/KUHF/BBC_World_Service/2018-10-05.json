no\nA lot of this is still left buried and we want to uncover it\nThe truth is going to come out I Believe that there are still some people\nAlive that had something to do with what happened on address all night and so it's important to me because it's going to to allow the truth to come out allow some closure and most importantly to me it's going to honor our ancestors is going to honor those people\nWho who lost their lives are in a most horrific horrific way\nBut that's a whole Harper there a toll for city council member and the person who's been long a calling for that investigation and supporting it\nDefines Osaka city in San Francisco I'm no longer friends and us official\nThe mayor the soccer sent a message to the mayor of San Francisco this week saying he's longtime sweats of ending the ... the relationship between the two is no reality I mean it's all because of the statue depicting women forced to work as sex slaves the Japanese soldiers during World War two\nIt is estimated that some two hundred thousand women were kept in the U.S military Brussels Heather night as a columnist for San Francisco chronicles her first of all what the sculpture itself looks like\nIt's a sculpture with three young girls in their teens I'm holding hands and their high up on a pedestal in Chinatown in San Francisco and then down below them at that grandmother figure\nAnd why has it become so controversial but it actually caused the two cities to cut ties\nYeah the statue there very controversial there actually being put up around the world now to honor these comfort women who were used during World War two as sex slaves but the Japanese government and some Japanese Americans don't like that they say that\nThe number two hundred thousand it's exaggerated and that they weren't treated as badly as people say and they ... the basic argument is that we shouldn't go out Japan for a wartime atrocities when so many other countries have done at things during our time\nAnd and how long has this been going on but because it's ... it sounds to me like the mayor of a soccer has said has been warning and warning about the statute looks like there's been you know lots of touring and feeling about this\nYes he's been sending these letters for two years actually because it took a year to actually installed a statue get approval and pick the place and everything and then another year since the statue and so a number of letters have come to San Francisco city hall saying if you don't move the statue of the property will sever the relationship and the mayor and never did do that and so\nThis week he did in fact sever the relationship\nSo what does that mean exactly when you cut ties between two sister cities what does that entail well\nOur mayor doesn't think it entails all that much because it's really between two committees of regular citizens who travel and visit each other and um for um cultural ties it's really a former they need to do then yes\nIt's just and the mayor expressed step aside expressing his anger over the statue really\nAnd so it it sounds to me like it doesn't really affect the relationship looking forward officially but not all\nRight I'm officially it and set but unofficially there's nothing to stop people have become friends from a soccer and San Francisco through the sister city relationship continuing to do that\nWhat about San Francisco's Asian population if they reacted to this statue at all what do they make of it and and that latest development\nReason that exists here is because to Chinese women who are retired judges found the San Francisco superior court spearheaded this effort they got the statue and um we have many many Chinese and\nIt can from San Francisco the Japanese population is smaller and they're sort of divided from what I've heard some press statue dissent against that\nHeather night there columnist for San Francisco chronicle San Francisco now no longer friends waited at Japan's Osaka city because of that statue\nAnd we have quite a few comments and shame on some of the top stories that the situation in the United states with the Senate and

T. L.\nNow to today's news and again we begin with the status of the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nLast late last night the Senate received the FBI report on its investigation into the sexual assault allegations made by Dr Christine Blasey Ford the Senate plans to vote to end debate tomorrow and then hold the vote to confirm this weekend\nToday reaction to the FBI report was just about what you'd expect with Democrats dismissing the report as incomplete and Republicans saying they're fully satisfied that there is no evidence that judge Kavanaugh assaulted Dr Ford when they were in high school\nEarlier today I spoke with Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy who just come off the Senate for Senator Chris Murphy welcome to America on the line\nThere is a correct me if I'm wrong you announced in July that you would be voting against a judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination writes\nI did I was one of the first out of the gate um apologetic about that I saw this trend coming to some study about cabinet once she became one of the final two or three choices and came to the conclusion that he was just way out of step with where my constituents were in Connecticut and so I announced my opposition to him early\nRight and today you took to the Senate floor to speak out a again against and what did you say\nSo I said today that I had come to a different conclusion I Believe that he is the most dangerous nominated has been before the Senate in my lifetime and\nAnd that conclusion was one I read shortly after his testimony oh there's so many things to worry about in that testimony obviously at the top of the list\nOf the very real likelihood that he did to things to Dr Ford that she alleges\nBut his should make it partisanship is threats to Democrats is believed to some Clinton connected conspiracy that's been run against him up to me is the most damning a part of this whole episode and\nWhat I was trying to warn my colleagues is it this is a Pandora's box that is hard to close once you start putting naked partisans on the court um you start to undermine the belief that Americans still Clinton too that there are\nAt least nine people in this country who are above the partisan fights that we have and I get that folks out that all the time I'm given some of the decisions that the Supreme Court undertake but\nWe do not since the days when we used to regularly put former senators governors McCord ah we've been faced with an individual who showed his stripes his political and Parsons stretch so clearly to America that really really worries\nYou can vote for an accent from the proper ... here or your can vote for an independent boy that's next time on here now [noise]\nTomorrow afternoon it's two pm on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven it's currently Seventy eight and your news time is eleven Twenty one\n[noise] and Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line\nAnd news and call and show ... mid term elections when we were in my see in public radio stations around the country joining me in New York City as word and political science professor ... and in Milwaukee conservative commentator and author of how the right lost its mind Charlie Sykes and also with\n... from Washington ... ... senior editor for the national review and fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWelcome all ah Charlie I'm gonna start with you and the calls that we had in that in that first block the calls that frustration I I actually was surprised that we didn't hear from anyone who um was an angry or frustrated with this process\nWell you have the right question because of course ah you know politically the question is which ... going to be more angry after this this takes place and you know I I kinda the guts ... whatever side is on the losing side of this boat will will be more motivated and\nThere's there's a lot of his political history about people who who lose by him who who's winning you ... follow him you know you'd go for example during the Obama years the ... ... legislative success with Obamacare lead to you know devastating mid term losses\nBut because you have to really competing narratives going on I mean there's clearly going to be pushed back by the way tomorrow is the anniversary of the New York times story that really super charged me to move in with the story about Harvey Weinstein it's just interesting ... comes together but you you have that narrative of Democrats being angry and motivated but also\nYou know I Do think that people ought to be aware of the the the backlash on the right the way ... which Republicans do seem ... least for the moment to be rallying around a rallying around a judge cabin on the even and ... firm supporter but man there's a lot of polling suggesting that ... at least for the moment\nUm I mean that's his either uncharted waters here I think it would have been odd for somebody not to respond with force and emotion in such a circumstance and I think if he had he would have served himself worse that a lot of people\nWould be asking you know why if he why would an innocent man I'm be so sort of calm\nAnd uh uh and sober about\nThese unbelievable uh charges and uh and the way a lot of people that treating him\nChristina so I don't trust it you know the frame or set up the Supreme Court such that they would essentially be immune to the whims of part is in shifts and changes and what cabinet exhibited last week was that he was hyper partisan and again trafficking conspiracy theories you know I've talked to a lot of\nUh individuals who study a abusers\nAnd he is a classic case of someone who is it it's all of the various symptoms of someone who is abuse it and not stable it steady you know it's it's beyond just emotional when he says I'm an even keel open minded independent dedicated to the constitution he displayed none of those traits when he was talking to\nYeah senators right not even senatorial courtesy\nOf it so that was problematic and we can talk about the process yes no one wants to be accused of anything but you know it's very fascinating that he and the president or trafficking in\nThis very specific language targeted to the fifty three percent of white women\nWho voted for Donald Trump's because they're saying listen this could be your brother or your husband or your son this is how they're keeping the Republican base with them right and ignoring what are some really very clear allegations that me time so if you are so adamant that you have not done this\nThan actually if you're going to be on the bench for life and spent a month or two\nDiscredited in every single person who said that you were inappropriate right why are we trying to rush that if you indeed are innocent then said let the process be the process and take as much time as the one because I Know the truth and honesty or on my side so I you know I\nI ... I Do and frustrated because I just think about as a black woman if I had gone to a job interview\nAnd yelled at the people who were asking me questions and almost started crying and talked about how much I Love beer I Would be scored it out of the T. C. D. Y. or the Starbucks or wherever I was applying you know and as a black man you may have been ... by security so I mean this is\nA real problem because we're looking at our institutions as Charlie ... said but\nThe the lack of respect that this president has towards our institutions is trickling down now to our congressional representative Republican senators and now our Supreme Court justice nominees\nI watched the ... of Clarence Thomas is a opening statement from when the hearings with Anita Hill happen and the contrast between what I'm now Justice Thomas said in his tone and demeanor\nVersus judge Kavanaugh's is literally a study in night versus day I'm In the little time do we have left I Want to go to a Caitlin in Newton New Jersey Caitlin thanks for calling into America on the line\nFor [laughter] Hi how are you good we only have a really nice seconds left you angry that straight as\nI Am angry angry and frustrated but I'm not surprised in the least fat I'm I'm twenty five years old I'm a social worker and a woman I'm I'm friends with people and unfortunately a victim of some sexual misconduct\nAnd I'm not surprised at all I'm not even the least bit surprised and um I feel like I haven't been surprised to see president became president so that's pretty much all I have to say\nOur our right Kaitlin just giving it ... to the\nEnd to the point of a child or a mentioned the minute that we that we have left once we get through this Kavanaugh this Kavanaugh vote and uh once we get through them insurance can we put this back together you\nKnow I think it's going to be very hard I think it's a bit of the damage is going to be long lasting and I think we're going to be paying the price for this for a long time and and just to clarify ... remembers wants to ... I'm not saying that he should not have been angry and and I think your point Jonathan\nThe contracts go back and watch Clarence Thomas sweating anger and yet he did not cross those lines I did not suggest that he bought it would've been Michael Dukakis when he had that you know deadpan response knew that I have your your your wife was murdered 'em but again this is where you know prudent\nRestrain anger can be more powerful than the sort of\nMe you know again the evening stream partisanship so it's it's not a case of anger versus not anger it's how did he expressed that anger and I do think the contracts with Clarence Thomas is a really good contrast remarks on his Chevy Israel was\nAttacked Justice Thomas accused Democrats of trying to Lynch and and he was criticized widely at the time on similar grounds that\nJudge Kavanaugh's being criticized now you know the job interview parallel that was raised earlier just strikes me as a sort of how many job interviews you go to where you are being accused of all kinds of wild thing on the basis of zero evidence\nYou know I I just think people are using an unrealistic standard here and there are also I also have a somewhat unrealistic view of what the public view of the court\nIs going to be if you have a conservative court the people who are upset about cabinet would be just upset about a conservative porch\nAnd Christina laughing Ninety eight\nPercent of cases yeah I think people would be upset about a conservative court but they also would be upset about someone who's an accused rape is where we haven't had time to actually investigate that right let's give it the time that it deserves to no one should be falsely accused and also know\nApplying for a job at Starbucks is not the same as applying for a job at the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court is a job for life and there are nine individuals who are tasked with upholding the constitution of the United states and we're\nGonna

few minutes we'll be getting calls from a number of teachers whose campaigns we've been following But Kevin can you give us a bird's eye view of what's been happening on the ground and how this movement started in states like Oklahoma and Arizona especially\nYeah so really this movement started in a pretty grassroots way I'm a lot of these teachers a first got involved with or\nFacebook groups where they were sort of sympathizing with each other about uh the state of their classrooms the state of their schools or their own low rates of pay in many cases\n\n\n\nIt just from the classroom but I'm not just from these immediate struggles that\nWere engaged in over a funding of our public schools but I'm also I Would say two decades of politicization of teachers around the education\nThe formula looking at rates so I'm standardization over emphasis on test scores um then moved to ... charter as the public school system I think all of these\nHave had an impact on our

I've been saying\nUh quite conscious of the environment is is a country that sees itself as as being quite green there recycling bins everywhere she something I've noticed\nAs you've mentioned the sales of electric cars and getting up thoughts let's talk about heart attacks and that is no way on TALK to me it's targets agreed under the Paris climate change agreement and twenty Fifteen as anybody knows about that\nThere is a scary well to shore towns that do that is no and that's actually something that we've been debating in the parliament that with the past couple of days as well because it's right now I think it's important that we realize that we're not on track towards reaching that that targets\nAnd also that we don't have any significant plan that's Abed his hair mentioned it to how to reduce our climate guessing missions in Norway it's important to understand that the climate policy in Norway over the past Twenty years has been mainly policy on how to reduce ... emissions abroad\nAnd a lot of the work that we've been doing now that like saving the rain forest it's been great but it's also in a way to sort of postpone the transition that we need to do in Norway and postponed is really tough choice is and how to reduce our climate gets ...\nGood ... uh the public in a sense being sold a bit of an agreement last just a puppet note that green after all\nI Will disagree or two cups care about that we don't have a plan I mean seriously we have debated a clown in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a seal tool in the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars stuff\nA part of the plan of the taxes for cars I mean we have Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy a car with the fossil fuel is full taxes\nSo for example does the active policy\nAnd we have to also take into account that this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the world solution you have to shut down the coal plants they are more pollution ing and making the problem and I mean Norwegian gas can be part of the sort of ...\nBecause new region gases clean up but if you think about ... new way could do given that it's wealthy what should it to what more can it do gas ... should no way in a sense be able to make more choices because of the wealth that enjoys\nWe have to do a looked at the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical buttons you can do one thing and then it will be sold that's not true because there's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do more renewables you have to\nReplace coal with gas like in the u._k. they could produce energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal because of the region guess that was the solution for them\nAnd of course it's not the solution forever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades\nBut we're going in the right direction and we have to go on the path\nThat I don't really think we're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policies I guess we continue with this this is your shoulders to political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and\nThe longer we continue with the businesses to show the harder it will need\nTo go out and get away the magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan what should the plan B\nWell I think we should start taking part of the national debates about how much more oil and gas we can put into the atmosphere because if we burn all the research that's been about now it reaches almost three degrees\nSo everyone needs to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for the oil industries to first of all run their company in a way to the benefits of ah their owners which is a state with\nA ... and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that may need a plan for how we can get off for five fields because I think there was a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that uh the public fest for example we don't want to Seventy percent of the north\nSixty percent totally in Norway said we don't want to open the most\nVulnerable areas in the north that are flippant areas and are they also have pulled showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons ...\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out into words are looked at China for example and uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders\nSo we have to look on a on a grander scale and I mean that's since Norwegian oil and gas is one of the most green ones produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because now specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat the ... this very important environmental area in the north of no way could be opened up to drilling important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very special area and the whole Silicon Valley as a horse so do you think is a tipping point as far as public opinions consent no I mean it's a quick or easy now because we have a political platform other government where we have\nTo agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's very important for the European\nAnd production of electrical power on the is actually part of making a Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hundred power is one tenth in energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and I'm just relaxing sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nCarry this this ... view that shed by much the Norwegian public that actually that's a new way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out the knee from the ground where the good guys and all of us\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame myself as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big\nEnergy transition now from fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfills few in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy investing in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the marsh gets to its we sell our petroleum as low as far\nAs you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for oil and places like the Byron see in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will still be producing in twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate gets ... well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about well yeah but\nMy point is that if you have replaced\nCoal plants root for example of gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the word greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do\nAll the ferret Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the old sinuses that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw in the ... when I was next sense and and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the national conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in ... for last week and I was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that nor with the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today I told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world's why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good\nNow the government's committed to legally binding emissions reduction targets the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by age to Ninety five percent of Nineteen Ninety levels and at the same time\n... off the value of this country's exports of goods come from oil and gas I often like Elvis tuned who's noise environment minister if the country's green credentials punished by the fact that they make an awful lot of money for ... feels\nThe need to be in front on taking into use the syndrome missions solutions that are doing with the transportation sector I mean we're sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month and those are close to fifty percent of the folks up the same time you know the oil and gas industry will become smaller part or economy\nIn the future so we must also have a policy for having a green shift\nWe've been ... looking at the hydroelectric power plant that\nThis is part of this project that led to Norway being dumped the green battery of Europe the idea that this country can store power that's generated elsewhere in Europe and then send it back when supply from other sources sticky unpredictable renewable slumped how realistic is that\nIt is realistic for us for the ... year old to ... to be part of the European system so we are building a million become actors Baltimore's German they'll ... being with us we become part of it if our resources are large enough\nTo become the bathroom for Europe I think that his mouth us realistic only this summer to how the drought we'll be old for me to import electricity from all the ... this is really connected the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which no way has written if you like to who says you've convinced public opinion that is is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing in a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are in the ... and that is not all male study is for the world to reads the Paris Agreement goals we how to make major changes to the next four twelve years so we really have to compromise the U.S marshals society has become a false us we can\nBut it's not really see that that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a sausage you for a social change economic change is\nMultiple Mitt moral question is really about the heart Pulitzer so how do we deal with climate change at the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\n[noise] that's the environment and his ... Elvis too and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to talk to her at the same time I don't think it's a park or see I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not drop out of all them\nVarious I'm interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable is going to go it stopped and killed all in the southwest it goes all the way to the northeast of England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce install access green energy\nIs this in a sense done in ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've leveled about his role as a fossil fuel ...\nMay be I think it's really good for us that they are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually ended up more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make us much here African did in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that the I've been thinking about energy we haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen that oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the youth energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if we want to be part of the European solution than actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we could put our money instead of\n... gay and when you talk to people here about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas to ... they're worried that the costs that they're going to pay to go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to save the world\nCourse they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline has given us a lot of energy and different forms over a lot of years\nAnd that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way we have a lot of discussion is above wouldn't move parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there so it's not that easy to just to shift on this\nAlso another concerned as huge that season to unions because of if you're export power you don't use it for industrial production in no way the discussion above your work about where you live what would you go to do it's a problem\nIs I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outsider called ... which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local or energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply the but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits your own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more energy I think actually we can\nMake really good energy futures there\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign such an area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is in ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy secure it is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we talked about there's only two developments and then reached an architect to oil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all them in order to Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it\nCan come and say well no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the developments in the uh the merit to them a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to how the Grinch shift to even do if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the American sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and veterans fish now in the energy sector is really happening and these happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the speeds of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it ...\nProbably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nRan shift is coming I think than technology will have developed so much that it will be\nGoing in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so a bit of ... about the role at technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy in ten years\nI think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think if it's going to happen by itself that\nPeople even though the projections that it will keep going until at least twenty feet I'll be some sudden increase\nThat's not the protections I Would say if you look at the expected production of oil and gas and Norway\nFiltered should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that\nOne I think that ... has probably reached its peak now and then ... ... yeah the one they expect that that would be more gas resources to be found so\nThat mean that question here would be should we ask each and politicians allow for the also the patrolling the gas industry to develop new fields for the future\nAnd that's something I Would argue against that but that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the that the oil price sale of so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the way are nuts and to know each since the site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are today oil industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think in that region\nPopulation do you believe that our oil and gas industry will be their fight for quite some time\nBut it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry is as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help the world that find solutions to the climate the to the climate problem\nThere is a ... a crisis could video and so then\nYeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our with it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera but they haven't really ... the effects of climate change so\nMore often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually a plan for it\nBut we can't really hold for a climate prices for Norway to to react\nGay a hot spell the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which ... citizens dependency on on oil and gas is how\nHow we we we we have to remember the last eight years we we reached peak oil in two thousand or so we're ... production of oil from the last eight years so we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing\nAnd with the predictions I see I Can't see that the one that is shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ...\nBut then what does that make media but line that change look for new ways role in that particular debate but\nAlso started up what you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry of gifts right you've you've lost this debate well\nLook we all lost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle\nClimate change and we're looking at three to four degree yes it is and and I would strongly\nInsist on that we need to shift the economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here and that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because ... is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is none of the whole for ah for the oil industry in terms of the economic ... diet I think actually that we will have the shifts sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role\nCan she wants to come you know I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy so\nThat we have to look ... question as well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good here yeah I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and in the long term as well and it will be necessary to meet the green shift\nNo loss of agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank

they once thought to land the effect white women in high income countries but we're such as national and the problem to be labeled\nAs the field evolves we have gone from believing that eating disorders were a phenomenon that only affected young affluent white\nEuropean or North American women to understanding that eating disorders actually are prevalent around the globe\nThis is Kathleen pike a psychology professor specializing in eating disorders at Columbia University in New York\nShe told me the ten China up until the Nineteen nineties only a handful of cases of anorexia and ... had been recorded recent studies suggest that Spain a dramatic increase since then there are no official statistics\nIn multiple different locations in China the rates of eating disorders and the presentation of\nAnorexia nervosa blaming her votes of binge eating disorder are all more or less on par with what we see in North America and Europe at this point\nKathleen tells me China's rapid economic growth has driven the change as countries on the guy says she'll and economic transition she says conditions to come right the eating disorders to develop\nOne of the things that happens is that populations on average increase in weight and in many cases that's a good thing but it is a problem for\nA subset of individuals within the society who then are at greater risk for eating disorders are you saying\nThat needs to be an abundance of food and society before someone has an eating disorder\nThat's certainly the case for the eating disorders that are characterized by binge eating so believe me nervosa and binge eating disorder they tend to correlate with\nRising population weight\nAnd you can only have rising population weight when you have an abundance of food\nSo it's not totally the case for anorexia nervosa that tends to have a pretty steady prevalence rate regardless of population wait the cause of eating disorders is multi factorial right so\nIn the context of economic development people also become much more sedentary people are eating more and burning fewer calories and so our weight goes up\nThe problem is that in a global world the glow\nWe'll beauty ideals are largely thin ideals and that's not such a surprise because beauty ideals are typically the state of being that is difficult to achieve\nAnd so in our world now where there's an over abundance of food and it is difficult\nTo avoid gaining weight then the beauty ideal of the thin\nWoman becomes all the more paramount too simplistic than to say this is a result of West and I say yes as we see the rise of eating disorders and other parts of the world\nThe patterns are on the one hand similar but in each case there are unique aspects to the presentation and the understanding of eating disorders and cultural context\nFor caffeine then to really understand the rise of eating disorders in China we need to explore the cultural context let's start by asking someone he's had an eating disorder when they felt there was anything about Chinese culture that make them ...\nOkay so high everyone um my name is staff I Am currently Twenty one years old I Am it's\nWhen Steph with

know some of the control of food should be taken away from the FDA and go back to agriculture right um and I think he'd be horrified by that\nBut he liked he liked the Michael Pollan's the world and things like that who you know what your grandmother I\nHave to apply you know what I mean one of my cases is that the stuff your grandmother was they didn't wasn't all that\nGreat right what you're saying and your book [laughter] and I think he went to see that as\nThe little romantic but the principle of it you know eat local grow your back you up your own vegetables don't eat too much

about the late night teens and early twentieth\nSo she was the principal of the Boston school of cooking and she use that to teach science right she taught all of her I always imagine them as being slightly stunned to students principals of chemistry she put chemistry and her cookbooks right Dr walks through all and then\nAnd this tells you something about how bad things were back then she did a whole sections in her cookbooks about fake food and about the dangers of some of the foods like milk she wrote a\nCookbook which was cooking for you know people who are ill in Nineteen oh four and she put in this whole section saying yeah but if you were going to make like a milk toast or milk gravy for your invalid you better be really careful about that milk right could be poisonous\nShe actually included you should ... tried to get people to pasteurized milk at home even right and and I think this is part of you never get change unless there's a conversation right so women like Fannie Farmer who were doing a kind of subversive education for women\nThey're really important in this time period and widely acknowledged that that he could not have gotten his what was called Dr ... law the

things of itself and makes biological molecules and codes the ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre

and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd to find ways of bridging the gap to show that we're not actually on completely different planet it's not black and white it's really\nThat that some kind of gray area in between and if I can find that we're both on the same gray area just in different places and it's much easier to think about sliding around it than to think about flipping an entire coin onto the other side\nThis is science friday from WNYC Studios\nI'm Ira Flatow talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of ... of logic in an illogical world I'm so one of the first things you acknowledge is that the real world is actually a logical [laughter] but we had a lot of use but we get we can get a lot of useful work done in the abstract\nYes we can find the logic inside situations even if the whole situation isn't completely no Jekyll and the discipline of mathematics begin with obstruction well you shave away\nOn completely relevant to the situation to find out what's really going on a route and when you go to the root it's that that you look at the logic\nAnd when you shave away those details you find that a lot of different situations become the same route and that gives you a way of connecting different situations and tapping into some understanding that you've achieved elsewhere and making connections between things but\nI I think that to achieve that shaving away process [noise] excuse me is probably one of the most typical parts [noise]\nIt might be quite difficult and it's one of the things that is off putting about mathematics people often say to me I was finally mass until the numbers became letters\nAnd somehow that says scary step but actually numbers are already obstructions that already things where we shaved away the details\nThat two cookies onto apples well if you ignore the fact that that cookies and Apple's then you get the concept of two and we can do this with arguments in real life as well where we can shave away details and discover\nThat arguments about say voter suppression have something in common with all these about arguments about cancer screening and arguments about accusations of sexual harassment for example because they're all about what do we care about false positives mall or false negatives mall\nAnd then we can see that those arguments come up and questions about social services any questions about who should go to university and those questions all over the place\nAnd what are some of the most common ways that you see people being illogical when the orange\nOne of the basic ones is when they simply use the wrong definitions right to stop and this is one of the key ways in which we might think that people are using the wrong facts and so for example I've seen arguments on the Internet goodness me there are some bad arguments on the Internet ever\nI've seen arguments on the Internet where people say things like they they believe that all immigrants are illegal and that is not correct or they they they support the Affordable CARE Act but not Obamacare\nAnd they've got the wrong definition of Obamacare in that case or that was a study a survey of undergraduate male students\nThat showed that many of them said that they would have known consensual sex if they thought they could get away with it but they would definitely not commit rape\nWhich means they built their own definition of rape\nSo we have to agree on terms\nBut we do and that's something that mathematicians have I castle about agreeing on Tom's right at the beginning\nSo then another very common era that people make is when they make a false equivalence between one argument on another argument on this often happens\nIn what's called a straw man arguments but like the south Dakota store person because I didn't like Jen during things I'm necessarily but if you make an argument that seems quite reasonable to you sometimes somebody will replace it with a much more extreme arguments\nAnd believe that that's what you were trying to say and then they'll knock it down because the extreme argument is much easier to knock down and that can be very aggravating because that essentially painting you\nIn a very bad light and then taking a moral high ground\nI Know that argument well talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of logic in logical world joined us or for for seven to

about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene you chain or a mathematician a scientist and residents\nSchool of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in Indian logical world and um [noise] we want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some\nSome listeners are phoning in and first one Alex's from Chicago Illinois neighbor [noise]\nHey they're either go ahead I sew up\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I don't so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at a male um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide your systems knowingly\nWasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system and so I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing I I mean that's\nUm and identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the program but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view\nAnd we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's lived as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the cool has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World
