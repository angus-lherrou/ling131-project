I guess ... this this narrative of that's out there that she\nHas embellish um her family history\nYeah and there's no wind from this right because like the Cherokee Nation is basically said just because you have some of this ancestry doesn't mean you're for part of this nation and so there's really no waiting for her politically right\nThe worst part to me is that she's legitimizing the kind of racialized Trump attack that was leveled against her if she let it alone then it just makes him look back right in the absence of that but the fact that she had to sort of you know get down to the ... to try to fight out this battle is I think certainly as you say ill advised but also just legitimize what the president has been\nDoing friday kind of reminds me a little bit of when when President Obama released his birth certificate almost like playing to the the the sort of a tin foil silly conspiracy theory that was out there that he was somehow not really born in the U.S\nAlso Donald Trump Donald Trump right so it's the same kind of thing um yeah she I think was fooled into thinking this was sort of make it go away or that she was going to sort of you know kind of show am I don't think he did anything other than\nPlay the game that he likes to play which is we talk about these side issues and we ignore sort of substantive policy things and it's it has I think in a negative effect the dumbest thing to me about this brain and is if you're a Democrat\nIn office I Would you want to be talking about something that's related to twenty twenty and not about the mid term yeah exactly\nNo I think that's right hey speaking of shocking we've got some really shocking news this is\nA murder of a journalist named ... in the Saudi consulate and it is like an Agatha Christie novel in terms of its interactions and just the number of people involved and like the effect of what this might have on the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia so what is happening here let's conflict church\n... is a celebrated a journalist who is a legal resident of the United states he has a a green card here in the United states\nAnd has been a fierce critic of authoritarian regimes throughout the Arab world but specifically has called into question some of the practices that have gone on in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nHe went in and never came out I was like not to make light because his ears kind of a hotel California deal yeah he walked in and despair she disappeared ... and ... and the and what seems to be the case is that he was murdered tortured in some cases I think the reports are they may have been dismembered\nIt truly tragic and horrific and the response from the Saudi Government has has been\nA mixed at best the United states has taken kind of this\nLeft right approach where you're seeing a situation where the president is in some ways I think making excuses for the uh uh the crown prince Mohammed bin ... a solid on 'em and it's resulted in this situation where\nIt the the the global community is condemning the actions of Saudi Arabia for something that's that's pretty outrageous young\nLinkage that American intelligence officials are increasingly beginning to believe that the crown prince is essentially culpable and the killing of this individual and so\nThis poses a real problems for the White House right I mean there are obvious financial connections between Saudi Arabia and us and this is really the kind of big dollar price tag\nOn this on the question for the U. S. is whether or not my fault pale and the president who are willing to kind of push aside some of that to be able to get a full and fair investigation of this because the murder of a person in this capacity is obviously problematic but we're talking about a high profile journals for Washington Post who\nHad written critical stories of this government this is something which definitely has to be considered an thought through these are the kind of trade offs that have to be dealt with when you're dealing with a kind of unsavory regime so I don't know how they're going to deal with this but that cannot let this pass and I think that ultimately is going to have some serious effect on\nThe relations with Saudi Arabia\nYeah I mean we've got real critical relationship with Saudi Arabia with turkey turkey and obviously you know the the energy elements hear him play oil and gas the markets themselves could be destabilized on an economic level if if there's sort of bilateral issues Saudi Arabia is threatened to kind of retaliate if people\nImpose sanctions against them this is a major international in global crisis and the question is kind of how the Trump Administration is going to approach it we know that the economic component is a is a significant factor and and frankly that's just the one area that the Trump Administration has been touting\nAs we in the run up to the midterms\nBut the news isn't entirely rosy here Brandon yes we've had record unemployment rates in terms of being a historically low\nGDP Growth is at a at an all time high wages are going up but\nAll of this is happening with skyrocketing and ballooning deficits the deficit just jump Seventeen percent of the CBS News reporting it's almost entirely as a result of the multi trillion dollar tax cuts that just for past\nWe've got growth we've got jobs but we are paying for it with a pretty big hot check right now yeah\nWell Donald Trump as you recall dubbed himself the king of debt so he's not concerned about this I think renting we filed bankruptcy three times it's not really an option for the United states of America is going on than just don't\nThink so but politically that's our question and remember Dick Cheney saying that Ronald Reagan essentially\nAllowed for deficit stopped a matter of political by he said famously deficits don't matter so I'm not convinced that Republican voters are that worried about this the fact that the economy is good I think is probably not the shield for them now the Republicans of you know Twenty years ago may have been more worried about it and they're clearly some who\nWere financially conserve enough to be worried but I don't think that the new Republican Party under the kind of leadership Donald Trump is really that concerned about it\nI don't think deficits have mattered since Dwight Eisenhower and he's the only one who seem to care about it right because whether it's a Democrat could being critical of Republicans are Republicans being critical of Democrats\nDepending on who the party in power as the other side says deficits are really important and that's I think the political sale and see here for the president though I mean he runs the risk of if there's any ... downturn in the economy there's no real tools left and sort of the fiscal tool box you have to try to right the ship you can't\nCut taxes anymore you can't spend any more than you already are but I think the larger issue here for the president is he pleads running the exactly the way he wants right now he's got people distracted on these other issues he's got a strong economy\nAnd Democrats I think are falling into this trap\nWhere they're not talking about the things that work for them immigration healthcare those are the issues they need to be focused on it but they're they're getting caught up in these other\nWell and you know I think Donald Trump could get some you know credit for doing some good things on the economy but I don't think he really has no he suggested that he's going\nTo come out with a nickel plan for his ask cabinet officials to essentially cut five percent in their next year's\nExpected budget so there's a ability for him to be able to you know pander to the economic crowded and maybe take some credit for having cut it but I think you're right that if the economy's going well and people feel their pocketbooks then the deficit is not something that's going to be critical\nHailed sock Houston um we are definitely privileged here to have all kinds of competitive races will talk about in a minute that the president is going to be here\nIn Houston writ large but we also have visitors from all over the political spectrum jak\nYes none other than celebrated lawyer Michael ... I decided to pay a visit to our fair city in Houston and did a fundraising event with Harris County Democratic Party\nMichael ... to me I don't know what your opinion is on it my own view is the guy is no different than like Larry Flynn was in the nineties right he's always he's exposing a bunch of stuff is not a real political ... I Am dumbfounded that people take him seriously from a political perspective\nBecause frankly other than representing Stormy Daniels and taking down the president's personal council the fact that this guy has an ... you know has been to Iowa and it is now touting himself as a potential presidential candidate seems just ludicrous to\nWell Ted Cruz called him the presumptive democratic nominee for why I'm sure jak cruise events they would love right because he's as flamboyant on the left as Trump is on the right so I spent a lotta people refer to him as like the Democratic\nDonald Trump I'm not sure that's what the country watch I mean that would be escalating war in a way that\nI think would be probably difficult for the Democrats the wind nobody else does Trump on this score so ... will hit back as hard as he gets hit on these things but I'm not sure politically that's where the party wants to go so it actually probably could have a negative impact right overall so I'm not really sure this is\nWhere the Democrats want to hang our hat\nYeah I'm not sure anybody really takes it seriously the idea of him running for president but you know what as long as people want to pay money to come here and speak and\nAnd and what it or want to donate to to the Democratic party I'm sure Democrats aren't going to mind and and and you certainly have a factions out there that ... that think that the fact that he wants to take the fight to Donald Trump and an aggressive manner as appealing\nYeah well speaking of fundraising we have got a tremendous hall from Beto O'Rourke I think we need to get him like a methodical and a top hat like the monopoly and so he can\nYou know spread around that money he's raised at forty eight million dollars this ornery that brings us total to just over sixty one million dollars so\nThis is a tremendous amount of money J what effect does it's going to have on the competitive Senate race maybe one of the most competitive Senate races in the country\nAnd we've had we've had the big debate brand and our big combo for today is of course unpacking the bat choke crews\nHad a cat up a debate and protect his final debate since we don't have the time my impression on at brand it was just\nI think straight up Ted Cruz is a tremendous technical debater um he stays on message he can define what he wants to do you may not like it but he's got he's going to go out there and say it\nOn that tour Rourke is unconventional and he proved that yet again by the strictest rules of bringing up a topic answering that topic and move and staying on message and pivoting against your opponent Ted Cruz I think is really a master at it\nBetter or ... I think he he certainly came out as authentic\nThe crews did a great job I think defining him I think he I counted to use the word extreme in association with a ... eleven times in the debate for better or this was a different kind of Beto O'Rourke much more aggressive called them line tag the return of blind Chad um what's your take\nI thought that I'm working backwards at that point was good that he needed to kind of soften that ground to blunt the fact that the president's coming right and remind people that it wasn't so obvious that these two were you know Ken and so I think that's a good sort of effect for or work\nBecause the Trump bump could be significant going for especially given when it's happening I agree with you I mean I think the debate generally wasn't very magnetic on either side I mean there's I think no way that you can be Ted Cruz at a debate like this doesn't happen he is just\nToo good the best stylistic approach that\nFor can take years to do this as a guerrilla war instead of a conventional and if he gets caught in this conventional warfare like a debate like that and he doesn't succeed so cruises much better at it and I think it definitely show here\nThat's not to say that it didn't land a few blows on the Iraq side I mean he definitely bloody cruises knows a little bit on a couple of issues right I think he was able to get him a little bit on health care\nAnd maybe on border security but the difficulty in trying to pin Ted Cruz down when he pivots and stuff like raising taxes and judicial confirmation stuff which is pretty popular Republican base it's really hard to find a real avid and so\nOn the question about the third day let's talk strategy I don't think ... I don't think he wants to I don't think he needs to be on stage again with Ted Cruz who\nIs just going to out run him again so why agree to that when you thought [noise] thirty million dollars in the bank and you can use that money to advertise and you can continue to rally support you can continue to get big numbers of crowds and get media attention from that why debate if you just are going to fight to drop off right\nI I think format matters and so the problem was the first debate since they were traditional podium style debate\nBeto O'Rourke is fantastic a town hall settings the magnetism he has his natural charisma comes through and he works better winning interacts with an audience and people cruises much much better at these sort of standardized form debate where he can track a particular issue he can control the dynamic\nIs much harder for him I think when he has to interact with an audience and that's where he is much more vulnerable so I mean I can certainly see the argument or at least the temptation from New York folks say give us a town hall let's do this thing together or we'll get a big audience let's see what happens\nBut I kind of agree with you if I I mean the thing that struck me was that they were both speaking to almost entirely different groups of\nAttacks and spray Ted Cruz's talking almost always exclusively to his base he wants to remind Republicans no matter where they are on the spectrum that Beto O'Rourke on social\nIssues is to the left them where they are and he's trying to get them to stay home just on that alone that tour is trying to energize people around ideas and and and and as it relates to Republicans he wants to let them know that he is the bipartisan one of the two\nHe is not the culture warrior he's not that that guy that wants to sort of\nMake such a bright line dividing folks he's the guy who wants to kind of bring folks together I think that the difference and so you can do that with TV you certainly got the money to do that a furor but I think they really works\nThese debates worked for both of them were were kind of analyzing of a different way I'm not sure didn't work for ... for for both candidates and do exactly what they want to\nSo let's break it down here big picture I think that\nIs you say these debates are about priming the base but or work the biggest challenge here to try to peel off certain kind of core voters from Cruz where maybe you're happy with him or with Trump that means especially healthcare potentially on the costs of war security ineffective for security so those are I think a kind of swing vote Republican\nTraditional voting women college educated voters suburbanites that's where he needs to be able to peel off before because he's going to need a good ten Fifteen Percent of the electorate basically switch votes switch parties and that's going to be hard to do these debates can help him do it but it's better to do it otherwise\nWould not just for this week party politics is recording George ... studio at Houston Public media\nA big things to or coordinating producer and the keeper of our debate prep for Freeman is special kudos to our Web and graphics team here at Houston Public media and finally sinks or audio engineer Todd ... a great debater whole Andre are and I'm running running house we'll see you next [noise]\nUnwanted vehicle interstellar news coverage donated to Houston Public media will invest ... feet in quality journalism and you'll get a tax benefits they think he's getting public media dot org slash vehicle to find out more\nEastern public media our mission is because I use it to balance look at the candidates and the issues but online content like the party politics I cast and the elevator pitch this election season formed dot org and cast your vote with confidence\nSupports Houston Public media comes from main street theater presenting the will do will accommodate telling the story of the creation of the first fully over by which Shakespeare's loyal friends saved his legacy through October twenty first and Main street theater dot com [noise]\nThis is your NPR station Houston Public media news ADHD even K U H of Houston K.

show that he will take fifty nine percent of valid sites and found that had died will take forty one percent save it for him Phillies ready\nAnd how would you assess the way the campaign has unfolded since that first round took place\nI think it's become much more brutal rate it's become intense I think everybody expected it become more intense because it was a it's a run off between two candidates who really polarized Brazil but\nI mean the last few days that had been accusations that the right has been getting an illegal helping hand from resilient known for that they basically being funding a campaign to hit ... use is with fake news about and not have had died and this is\nBeing an issue throughout the campaign so much of the campaign is being through social media three ...\nAnd it says to me that you can really get hold all the understanding that he will information is being policy about this being an awful lot of concern about fake news being passed on both sides but it has to take anything noted that from the rights against the laughter\nIs being ... and intensifying campaign against them there had to us\nWith the country being as divided as you describe as

have such a divided population I mean you speak Brazilians and no one really likes to talk about politics here there are so many families who full and outside of the issue if you vote for one side or the other I mean ... fat groups\nEverybody just despise really upset and family members whichever side that brought it said tense time hair and body of\nWater of direct debates between the two candidates at any point as that happened to do\nWell that's the thing is that with Dr Olsen are becoming stronger and stronger he's become more\nIntent on or not taking part he's cited medical reasons why he ... he was stabbed in a campaign right about that seven months ago and he cited that as a reason why he wouldn't be able to take part in debate I think it'd be signed off now he's he's able to take part in it but he he doesn't he does Facebook lives talks to have supported\nAnd I think it is a lot of people because they feel that they should be this discussion between the two men had died has even said that he'd you know go to the ward savvy debate but nevertheless\nAt the Manhattan debated and we just have a friend both an hour is through his face the lives and told them that fans that way and it seems to be a painting to have supported his tail that he's a different politician he's not getting down the traditional way it's not it's paid and\nIf Mr both in our own wins is it possible to identify particular policies which you might see coming in very soon after he celebrates that victory\nNo I think that the issue is that he talks a lot he talks the talk that people want to hear about changing read sell about making sure that people are attached to 'em so they can deal with violence grand fight in his country these kinds of policies that how how he's going to see that

so Janine homophobia who refers back to the minute tree jump to Brazil\nA relatively warmly yes he looks as if he's going to win by a landslide\nWhile I think is what's going on in Brazil by the sound of it is exactly what I'm going on in much with the rest of the world um it's the rise of populism 'em up sort of nationalist populist with\nA strong sense of\nUm you know quite militants um [noise] uh and with some grounding security services or the army\nI'm it's exactly the sort of outrageous stuff like you know I'd rather have a son I'm rather than a game on\nUm on or she was too ugly to rate it's it's not you know this of the ... exactly the stuff that I'm gets them votes um and the first country to look to\nUm is is America um you know after Donald Trump's election um ... outrageous stuff he says the more it seems ... gets 'em I mean it's happening everywhere it's happening in America it's happening and actually\nUm it's um it happened in Russia for some time ago\nUm so do you know this sort of quite militants noxious populism is gaining ground um\nHow much longer you know to get a little bit of ... he was saying how much is it to a a reflection of what's going on before and where the failings of what's going on before\nI mean my sense is that that context for all of these transformations as a kind of an intensification of austerity programs that massive\nAn increase in inequality elsewhere and I think that that that that is actually happening in lots of places and so the populist reaction when when the left or the left party it's institutionalized left parties have shift that's family to the middle and have supported us that the\nUm the people who have been the losers in this in these programs of us that they are looking now today's a right wing or\nAn architect says military and militias support it and a candidate and much devastating about Brazil I think this is in particular very scary is that both in Iraq is a Trump figure that what is it scary about those ... ... is not just what they're doing\nTo the set of social relations in that country with women gays blacks in this country that also won the intensification of policing and those places

and uh this is on top of the expulsion of hundred and fifty\nA um diplomats old people working under the diplomatic cover a who we're connected to to the judge you and then of course was the Dutch uh uh the printing press conference and the hay and that really was the most unprecedented stuff because\nUm this was a joint press conference between um the security officials in the Netherlands\nUh and uh oh Britain um uh and uh the stars and basically divulging the information uh which normally security services don't like to to publicize for two reasons\nOr one is that it's a it's a ... you'll have a ... to the capability you have\nAn second the security services actually done like escalation Z a but this was actually Britain um Britain than in the Netherlands and and the United states which immediately you should indictments a of a Seventy argue agents\nEngaging in the information ... counter offensive uh too with a purpose to a sort of humiliate isolates an expose Russia's actions

Wimbledon but women is chief executive Richard Lewis says ... place to go on little long enough is that\nIt gets to twelve all then we show the CIA and the best interests of applies no matches at in the subsequent rounds\nIt's best to torture close with a tie break there were mixed views it's fair to say that makes us but they play fight with the final shut tied right they they recognize that the caller Shia tennis goes down or stop playing with him not\nTo lose rather than you know the excitement of all the termination to win\nAnd and also they recognize it affects the quality of the matches

example have been at the core of colonialism for example say and it's not just a it's not just the hedonistic exercise all the shit well perhaps the that but it is also really actually quite a serious project about how how the food in Middle East I mean\nYou mentioned about I mean I'm looking at a list of other places that you might consider talking about ...\nFrom I mean it is the airport in

Shakespeare\nAnd I'm going to lose that you had just before it gets into that I mean just listening to this amazing projects some good journalism was supposed to be cushy job that would be interesting\nPlaces and do fun things but um I might have to reconsider [laughter] we've been together so I've been well this this so this book has actually was a a group has what might be deeply academic book\nI'm no gender stick a tool ah no it's it's a popular book\nI Hope I'm and it's about um it was called Shakespeare and spend his last Skinner grew out of my a PHD which was about um the perception of England and English as a in Russia a [noise]\nA during you know for the first two decades of the twentieth century through the novice or when the revolution and particularly by the production of Shakespeare Dickens and bar in other states with the Moscow is fair to the face with that produce check of a\nI was best known as a fatal sort of psychological realism on how they dealt with um with Shakespeare so it's a you know it's a it's\nA story off Russia's perception an interpretation of Shakespeare and house than his last few who\nUh is best known in the west as a sort of ... the man who are behind the method acting a but it's really it is about psychological realism on how the system of acting which everybody's familiar with them and say shades with check of\nActually emerged in order to sort of um in order to sort of a Shakespeare\nWhich place were produced and which ones are popular\nUh well they were a ... you know throughout a at that time obviously not ... and the tragedies of the the the interesting story I mean the um on on the comedy is um\nThe interesting stuff actually comes later in the twenty first century one style and effectively bans\nOmelet ... um you know one play\nThat he just doesn't like and it is not performed in Moscow or from um Nineteen eighty nine to such as until his death and what will he only has about the ... to the plate put a ... it's not it's not entirely clear we have a rocket of him talking to a a to an actor\nActually in ...\nUh about Ivan the terrible and saying you made him into some sort of a you know ... ... as a sort of a way of criticism whether it was the criticism whether it was the mouse trap\nA scene that ... it was a little bit too close but it was this you know he had ... aversion to that play 'em whereas on the other hand a fellow um don't perform the last I think the other interesting thing is that a lot of solved and plays you know the place sat\nWhich assassinate to leave 'em so uh oil you know the ... I'm a fellow\nGet Donald ... because Russia sees itself in the ninth societies that sort of a as a sudden ... you know as a as a place as a warm played in a country where is the northern tragedies ready to get done a tool and I say how much is not done it's all a McBath very very rarely\nThe all the ... the history plays in all done um so it's um it's a ... I Hope it's reasonable a boat and it's not just for academics and it's not it's all part of it I mean it's for anybody who's hopefully interested in Russian culture in Shakespeare\nThe will to books to look out for in the future we've just had outlined some of the last three or four minutes and then today Afghans voting in parliamentary elections for the third time since the full of the Taliban

police chief general Abdul ... along with the provinces intelligence chief the Taliban claimed responsibility for those deaths stuffed in ... he made a spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah told a news program why the ... was necessary\nBut a case of Kandahar Ross it was the editor of stability and this province it has its impacts from the candidates in order to on the voters\nThe decision was to give them more time to recover from the psychological impact of the attack and or make the right decision but the struggle with continue if the terrorists\nWithout chief international correspondent leads to that is on the line from the capital ... how do you assess the mood on on voting dailies\n[noise] what I think it's very difficult to describe a mood across this country because the situation will differ district by district we have reports that\nTell them on a blocking roads and some of the southern provinces to the voters can't reach the polling stations but I've just been out on the streets of Kabul they're quite quiet but on every street corner and around every polling center there is a ring of steel with the police\nAnd army I just had to keep this day

packed\nIn the women's side there was a crush of women all trying to get in to cast their ballots and on the men's side as well along Q A winding around the school yard\nAnd of course of the question is whether it's election will continue to be safe all day whether the protests will be free and fair but it you have to you have to be impressed\nBy the bravery of Afghans to come out in such a large number despite the real threats by the Taliban to stop this voting on that\nNote specifically the events in southern Kandahar Province which I mentioned that this started this conversation how significant a day and that ... do you think\nOh huge huge huge if a powerful police chief general Abdul ...\nIsn't safe then who is safe in Afghanistan it's sent a shiver and the spine of this country but then when Afghans dino collected themselves\nAfter ... right across social media there were so many Afghans whatever their divisions are either ethnic or political lines healing\nA general Rodriguez has great Afghan patriot and hero then they started to say that this must you fight this I haven't really been struck out in the last week up in ...\nHow many Afghans have said to me I'm not afraid I'm not going to let the Taliban scare scare me I Am not going to let the Taliban and when you do you they really deserve a badge of courage for even for turning out to vote in what should be the most normal\nOf of of a process he's in any country around the world\nBut let me bring my ... maybe questions to you and your mind\nI'm what I'm curious about is how to reconcile the idea that on the one hand ... uh utterly disillusioned with their politicians and they find them corrupt and ... and and the other hand the voting and these large does\nEither something about uh the spirits of of Afghans if you did in the country and at that has\nFor the young generation has always been at war props except for that brief period after the fall of the Taliban were they dared to hope that this would be their best chance for peace and in many generations I think you keep fighting I mean so many young Afghans said to me I don't know when I leave my house in the morning whether I Will go home alive\nSo when it when you live in such darkness every bright light burns brightly and in this election there are more young educated Afghans running than ever before including for more than four hundred women\nThat is the distinguishing characteristic of fence or a month\nAnd a because other foundations don't have this inclusive approach\nThere more than eight hundred women in Columbia who've

order to give them comprehensive assistance I care understanding mental health is a part of well being in a lot of other areas\nUnderstanding the connection between the possibility to access to justice to war to education to support for their families in order to be healthy mentally and physically\nBecause presumably the psychological impact of something like this\nYou are left wondering why it happened you're left wondering about the people who did each\nAnd your left having to get used to the fact that if you look and feel different\nExactly the psychological impacts are as strong as the physical impacts they're not that simple that they are there and this is actually one of the areas that is\nNeglected by a lot of the services that they can access to in Colombia we already have a very good service for physical health but a lot of times the follow up for their families and for them it's not available or it takes\nToo long for them to access to and they're alone and us so we sort of help them to not be alone to understand that\nThis has happened to other women and that they can also talk to other woman to recover and to feel like they can take control under lives and transform their lives embracing what happened and understanding it in a very different way\nMonica ... Rodriguez a psychologist for the vents are re most organization in Columbia we'll prevents already mostly is cofounder Patricia SBC about her interpreter Irina ... by highlighting that kind of issue that I can make a difference\nI think it does and I think it is\nReally quite important but it's also quite important to recognize that I noticed the current uh attack my often young men against women world over in various forms and then in North America they take a gun and they go on mass shootings raised in India their rights are and happened across different cast and\nOf course acid attacks is something that we see in Pakistan and in here and on and on and in Columbia as well and\nI and I think that that is part of the backlash against the rise of\nA women's activism more visibility by women\nIt is inevitable that women's activism and patriarchal cultures which is just about everywhere in the world is going to generate this kind of punishment mentioned the ... out of your car you think that's a big factor I think it's a big factor is the factor everywhere patriarchy exists everywhere but I think\nThat in countries also that have undergone some sort of violence trauma or there's some sort of an economic break down this form of backlash becomes that much more intensive Hi\nCody what are your thoughts [noise] oh yeah well this is almost completely horrific um [noise] I I agree I haven't thought about the um aspect that's actually very interesting I'm told that it is a backlash\nUm I think the mole yes I think the more visibility um give it um the bus or a really and it needs to\nAh to become um you know just as this um this criminals I'm trying to stigmatize\nOr women um they need to get stigmatized and um it's it's not just about prevention of crime by police methods of actually also making them complete horizon out cos I'm\nIn societies in in that thinking that this becomes a something that is just so uh you know it doesn't become an arm into frequent field as a tax is one of the most boring thing I suppose the\nProcess of of highlights though clearly put you as an individual at great risk\nDoes but I think it is significant I mean a lot of activists put their lives on the line because I think in this instance for example de stigmatizing the disfigurement it's hugely important\nIn a sense make it a such that to a woman that has this figure does not seeing or woman who's been raped and other ... instances not seen as somebody who's been stigmatized I think that's the role of the activists take one out of course they do so at great risk to themselves but I think that's that's\nI remember that a lot of these I think that was a survival I mean in a way it's incredibly brave was\nThe victims do but it's also a coping mechanism to the survival it's it gives you an active role yeah like yesterday I called the ... and Kelly you're listening to weekend from the b._b._c. world Seventy ... but it's in the news and [noise]\nAnd the next on being what Berkeley ... early ... learned about emotion in politics and about herself in Tea Party country\nThere's a lot of trouble to each year I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of old cocoon and I've long\nBeen here as I Am in China last\nSunday Morning at six o'clock on Houston Public media news eighty eight so\nNext time on the New Yorker radio our interview with Sally Yates is acting attorney general she said no to the so called Muslim travel ban and then what happens [noise]\nUm I was fired and [laughter]\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable hired by now [noise]\nSally aged talks with Jeffrey tube and next time on the New Yorker\nRadio Sunday Morning at nine o'clock on Houston Public media NPR for Houston [noise]\nThis is your NPR stations Houston Public media and he needed seven ...

spent on buying me time [noise] and on paying for chemical tries to keep me alive and to allow me to spend\nMore time with my children [noise]\nIf I die and a truly hope that won't be the case the money it would provide for my family [noise]\nThe women of art and can no longer put their trust in the service ... program [noise]\nMistakes can undo happened but the conduct of certain checking the hatred the in my case is unforgivable\nI once had become clear that there were problems with the test how come over and then went told that they needed to be retested\nNow to a major issue here I mean cervical check had done this old as I look back on every case of cervical cancer diagnosis to see what the original slide reviewed had found so they reviewed over three thousand cases\nThat old has had essentially been done for educational purposes and as well as well intentioned but very poorly managed so women weren't told their slides had been reviewed and critically that didn't certainly two hundred and Twenty one cases\nThey might have benefited from an earlier a diagnosis or a different intervention\nSo that initial group of two hundred and Twenty one women are families were identified by the health service we now know that twenty women have died but we don't know the cause of death in all cases\nSome women died without ever knowing about this or this\nSurvey go check had told some doctors that several women shouldn't be told that a false negative results have been identified in ... there was a dispute of sorts between cervical check headquarters in Dublin\nAnd doctors and hospitals around the country as to who should actually have responsibility for protecting the women doctors who would not being involved in this ... some of them didn't feed it was their job to be telling women that perhaps mistakes have been made by others but not by them\nSo it was the reason that they knew by then that they had cancer that time it passed and taunted moved on set is abnormal cells that are being seen on the initial Smith had been developed since ...\nYes I mean that that's correct also the way some women were told is also an issue the subsequent inquiry found there'd be an uh what they said was a ... paternalistic culture by conditions\nThat some doctors told patients of the issue in a very hard for them on the fence away the report quotes from various women voting coups quotes like doctor said what difference would it make one woman asked how would I be informed ... almost told by her doctor watch the news\nAnd then also one consultant pointed to a woman smoking habits and one tiny or about her her diagnosis and another a consultant said ... don't get cervical cancer a comment that if you weren't having sex you wouldn't catch device\nThat causes cervical cancer I Do believe some of these cases will go to a medical council hearing I think that to some of the women will make a report and there will be ethical and professional tribunals into the forms of some doctors\nNot just recently another of the women who was awarded a large settlement has just died itself\nYes so in June ... county carry with five children settled her case against another lab quest diagnostics in America for seven point five million euro\nEmma died over a week ago and she was an amazing campaigner for truth in this affair and she fought very hard for her children to protect them and ensure their future there was a huge outpouring of sadness in the country this week during her funeral here she was speaking on our to your radio after she learned her cancer had spread\nTo have kind of guy ... had\nA guy in my chair and I I tried everything\nAnd what does the government said they'll do about it\nOr the government was forced to order a review and pointed the British public health expert Dr Gabriel scali and his report was published quite recently and he found the cervical check system was doomed to fail he found serious gaps in the expertise in governance of us he did find no evidence of conspiracy corruption or a cover up but\nHe was highly critical of the attitudes and lack of openness by some doctors and not ... of the results or the way they were told and he called has called for a mandatory open disclosure into health system here so legislation needs to come into play structure or something like this\nDoesn't happen again under discussion as we speak at those a compensation tribunal being set up to avoid women like Nicki feed them and ... and we're going to having to go to court for difficulty hearings to get compensation\nSo do the women who were affected by the Smith test that were incorrect labor pool shed now ...\nThere's going to be other as a doctor scali appeared before a parliamentary health committee last week to discuss his findings and he said the basis by which the hate Jessie the ... executive of calculated this group of two hundred and Twenty one women that that was slow so he did say on those are the more\nWomen will be found to be affected the results were view we're going to be a review of that one thousand days hundred and fifty slides by a team from the royal College of obstetricians and gynecologists in Britain\nSo that should tell us more some women understandably don't wish to get involved in it or for legal reasons won't give consent for their sights be examined the will be more women the exact numbers we don't know yet\nI was talking to federal balance now change the world life expectancy lead tables that out with predictions for how long people living in different countries might live on average in the future and Japan which had the highest life expectancy and twenty sixteen doesn't help the child so who does\nYour Japan's been leading the world for ages and this focus it goes up to twenty forty says life experts in Japan will be eighty five point seven years well it's been bitten by pointing Warner if he is a little over a month by Spain at eight to five point eight\nYears and this is in the future that isn't that this is now\nYeah this is the projection looking at current health trends whack countries all around the world are going to be\nBy twenty forty and bought this team of scientists have done is they've looked at Seventy nine risk factors that affect your house about things like smoking rates obesity rates but also by the people have access to clean water and sanitation and some more unlikely things like income and education levels\nAnd pollution looking at those trends and then for casting into the future in about twenty as time ... impact those changes and those kinds of going to have a life expectancy\nSo all the countries all around the world to Spain's getting it right what are they doing\nWell it's this transition that we've talked about before I think most people know is going on\nOf how the things that kill us stopping being those big infectious disease and more diseases of lifestyle things like heart disease some types of\nCancers as well and ... Spain is doing quite well out is those\nGood lifestyle behaviors so if the good old fashioned Mediterranean diet but also lower smoking raises one of the things that keeps them ahead of Japan which has a a slightly high smoking right particularly in men enough how Spain has managed to leave the table\nAnd his life expectancy still rising in most countries whether or not that high middle income countries\nWill globally they're expecting a full point for ... increase in life expectancy over the next decade and a bit\nHowever it is a mixed picture and you could get a lot of rich countries making a huge amounts of progress places like Japan Singapore staying in Switzerland or all going to have life expectancies over eight to five years on average according to this focus but you get other countries Central African republic Zimbabwe\nSomalia so so all under sixty five years so what you're seeing is\nThe water is being progress being made that huge gap in between the poorest and the richest countries isn't closing\nAnd this report also has a warning that one is attempting to do is work how will the best case scenario and the worst case scenario is for life expectancy in the coming decades\nAnd specifically for this hypothesis our star to confirm that children and we saw Smith who use medication how strong your risk of developing obesity\nSo it could be that it's the it's the medication that's contributing to that it's hard to know what to do about that isn't it because they need to take the medication in order to not have the ... well\nWe're just need I Need to know if ... and I did good treatment of fast mechanics use the trajectory do word obesity\nAnd we can expand our knowledge of the potential ... obesity and if we have enough information than we can better targeting derivation of ... children for example dated interventions ... dietary part they're reaching on the auction downsides us for exams and indeed uranium died pattern\nOr physical like DVD interventions and we can uh let's say advise the parents and the families we have ... children and if he's he's ends on how to help us not the job done to grow up and to prevent the obesity epidemic in this children\nIs it possible that as something else going on and that's the same children who have asthma old so I'm more likely to be a base and that is that some other reason some other association going on\nYes I mean in terms of the biological mechanisms\nWe know for example the most prominent biological mechanisms that could explain the observations D'Leisha any systemic inflammation we know that the alterations in Libya metabolism ordering got microbiology and also ... mechanism for asthma and obesity\nAnd also we should take into account that the interplay between ... obesity is a vicious cycle because of these children with asthma have usually increased symptom medication use an ass nexus invasion showing these two conditions are\nLinked very well together and we should understand the cause of direction between them\nSo what do you think needs to happen next to be able to pin down exactly what's happening when do you need to follow people up for it you know twenty is\nYeah we have I'm going to start is with longer follow up and currently I'm coordinating research project comprised of multiple cohorts in the United states\nAnd in this project we want to replicate those findings because you know the European study is the largest one that we have up to now but we know we have to determine let's say whether every onset asthma and other off my related to ... to for example ... childhood obesity\nAnd also to investigate whether factors like ... or sleep nutrition in us my children no physical activity or said they didn't behaviors or diet\nCould modify these associations show us to design the best interventions that is\nNeeded shot see now change before we go after such out on a new type of condone which lubricate to self ultimately so house is

really liked this approach because rather than somebody being very kind of like pumped with and saying you must use condoms because they're really good for same sex and preventing the spread from infections that goes but one of the reasons people don't use condoms and this it challenges\nBut some people will tell you it makes Texas less pleasurable and this goes about trying to challenge that try to improve them so they can be more pleasurable jarring into goals\nAnd then seeing if that can actually increase company so I actually think he's a really clever approach the uses human behavior

London or daily it's today\nYeah that's right to know missed by any standard in in comparison with for example London during the same time period it was a monster of a city and how many people that's an excellent question and effectively unanswerable because we simply don't have the historical fidelity to answer that but the estimates range from seven hundred and fifty thousand up to ... million\nBut again those numbers are very rubbery and it really depends who you talk\nTo what everyone agrees on was this open a gray area and since he was sustained bunk and enormous in critical network of ... miles ultimately the weak point that down penny has been studying\nIt's an interesting system when you look at it the water distribution network achieved several things it was a multifunctional network\nIn Maine that was providing irrigation water to agricultural fields of course and also domestic water supply but it also played a role in mitigating flooding in the city so large volumes of water was stored in the ... reservoir some of which were\nSixteen square kilometers in area the single reservoir on and storing many millions of cubic meters of water so these systems which fed those reservoirs and the canals which captured surface water flow\nWere designed also to mitigate the risk of flooding and what is a very seasonal environment so this is critical infrastructure to the functioning and the flows of the city when it was active\nAnd am I right but what you be looking at is the ... that infrastructure played that in the demise of this extraordinary civilization\nYeah that's right I think we need to make an important distinction here in the sense that we're not talking about the demise of a civilized nation but rather the fragmentation of into the network\nCertainly what we suspected for some time is this very large and very complex system was severely damaged by flooding\nIn the latter part of the fourteenth century and we know that in some way I feel I did with that period of extreme climate variability during the fourth and fifth in centuries I mean we have long suspected that the functioning of the critical infrastructure that was represented by this would've distribution network was somehow interrupted\nAnd that led to sexual outcome that we say and they say the relocation at the Capitol\nI mean it's a very interesting phrase somewhere in your paper about cascading failure so it sounds like some parts of the system was pushed over the edge of men they bought ... it'll ...\nYeah I think the cascade is critical to this argument and that's what we saw to determine precisely whether they would be a cascading this system given certain conditions and we are all very familiar with these things because we experience them as blackouts in various infrastructure networks that we rely on his part of a die earlier than lives\nAnd so effectively the argument here is that you can have a very small disruption to one component of the system which can then propagate out very rapidly to create a much larger outage that maybe network wide or at least ... parts of it were effectively compromising its core function\nSo you're saying it's a bit like where the electric power system goes down it might be just one link that goes down and then it brings the rest of your favorite one Lincoln this canal network march of gone then others followed\nYeah to exactly right and it's precisely like a power outages the very small disruption which might be simple as an overload switching station somewhere can actually create a problem which may be much much much larger and more significant\nSo he said that there was an overload of some ... related to these\nMonsoons yeah precisely said they were talking about in the system is not an electrical obviously but it relates to a period of a particularly wet monsoons during the latter part of the fourteenth and nearly Fifteen centuries which sits between two very large in prolonged drought so this was a period of\nQuite dramatic climatic instability so the evidence of the damage created by these floods this overload as you say is very clear and the landscape very easily measured what we wanted to know was does that damage create a cascade with tech have this entire system\nAnd I'm just sort of try and work out how it would do what would the failure of one come out have in terms of the whole network of canals\nYeah it's an interesting question that relates to a feedback between erosion which you might expect in a flood situation and set imitation which you might not necessarily expect so al model estimated the dynamics of erosion and said I'm In ... in these canals systems given a sitting magnitude of flooding\nWhat we found was if you're putting more water down a canal which is not designed for it\nYou will trigger incision and that's precisely what we see in the reminds of the network a single canal or writing down into its paid several nations in doing so begins to style of flow from other parts of the network\nIn of course juicing set imitation there is a feedback between erosion instead of ... in a concentration of flow into a single pathway through the network\nEffectively stopping most of the network of water a day by fracturing the system breaking get into a smoke compliance which are no longer functioning I think is\nPretty amazing this cascade of events could bring to its knees this great just if you're on the climate\nIndeed and it's an interesting question whether this was the act that caused that shift from encore to the cycle middle period cities closer to the mode and capital of ...\nOr whether this was simply the final event mocking the end of a city which was becoming increasingly unwieldy and increasingly irreparable so it's an interesting question whether this was the ... or whether it was simply that the event that broke a system there was no longer being maintained\nTen penny from the University of

resistance mechanisms they become very difficult to treat and we're left with a few chemical treatment options wonderfully cheese can lift and quite frankly there's very few options clinically we have
