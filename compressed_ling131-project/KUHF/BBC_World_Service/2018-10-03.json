T. L. we'll be talking about the growing gender divide in how it may impact in mid term elections a little later in the show\nBut for now we want to bring you up to date on the ... the latest news developments there's the progress of the FBI investigation of claims against judge Kavanaugh there's an update on Rod Rosenstein job status\nOh and the New York times is reporting that President Trump appears to have committed tax fraud acclaim denied by Trump's lawyer and also by the White House or a statement that just hit seconds before we went on air from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders oh and now New York state is investigating so\nAnother typical slow news day\nLet's turn now to Washington Post reporter amber Phillips amber welcome back to America on the line and they're happy to be I'm\nOkay so let's take the the er the last thing first and that is the the latest response from the White House from Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this bombshell New York times story about the ... they're flat out calling it a tax fraud\nOf not just a now President Trump but the entire Trump family\nYeah I and as you said it's coming out of four around the arts them reading it right now it does not look like she Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking out simply deny the allegations are the key line here is\nMany decades ago the IRS you inside on those trends accents and then she goes on to attack\nThe New York times uh what that suggests to me there's not a clear denial of the things that the New York times accuses President Trump of doing that being said the New York times that quote Trump lawyer saying a\nOr denying any allegations that\nActual rod and activation a new one of the ... one of the incident um analysis of this is that\nIt sort of blows a hole into the president's image that he has perpetuated of himself as\nI'm a vet um there were all of these guys who are many of whom were made a lot of money in self help books and self help pod cast a four men are and they started off talking about sort of weight lifting and things like this might sort of issue was\nThe mastermind behind the the pizza gate ... right yeah that was my sort of had she now works for him for wars\nBut he is one of the kings of this NATO sphere\nThem they it was All right with the coming together of that\nThat online presence with the white nationalist and so this aggrieved male identity thing has always been a core part of that in politics and that is Donald Trump's world that is certainly don't Trump juniors world that its unapologetically always been where he's gone for health and this has to be expecting a Lexus\nI just you know it's some something I Want to kind of correcting the question the way your post and and I think you're just drawing on the president's on words here of the idea that somebody\nYoung men should be afraid of being falsely accused student adjusted to safety for being accused of something I I the false pieces is biased and the question I think and the president's perspective is that\nCabin eyes and innocent man who's been falsely accused of something which you know really doesn't jive even with the testimony we heard last week in which basically he\nActed like a person who wasn't so much being accused of something false to somebody who is passed with more catching up with him and he was being held responsible for his actions is that there should be consequences instead of drill down even more specifically I think ... absolutely right pointing to the genesis of the Trump\nConstituency but also the fact that we have this reckoning with what it means to be particularly white and male and privileges in America\nAnd this idea that now maybe there isn't a separate set of rules for those people is coming into focus and that's very scary for everybody who is in power this whole time and I loved that\nKevin I talked about her to get into Yale with any help but his father is buried at Yale which again you don't just end up being buried it yeah you you ... that is they they just ... the idea that that would not occur to him to be a privilege is what was so interesting to me in that moment the unseen\nLet's go to coy in Asheville North Carolina coy thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you for having me I just wanted to say a couple of things number one uh I think President Trump's remarks were totally off color and a tone death of the situation that being said I was ... you use the sexual assault in college\nI started dating a girl who my friend told me that news at the mental issues um but you know I thought you straight show uh we were dating and one night we you know and it got drunk and um [noise] the next day she called me and said that I had sexually assaulted her\nAnd my first than any reaction was oh my\nChoir you still there and\nYou're you're you are breaking your ... can you hear me\nSee\nOkay looks like we've we've lost we have lost coy um\nWho was a said that he thought that the president's comments were tone deaf I'm an off color but was relating his uh his experience of being falsely accused of of sexual assault\nAnd we didn't get to the the the finish that story let's go to Christine also in North Carolina in Greensboro North Carolina Christine welcome to America on the line\nWell thank you good evening\nSee some coal fired cash flowing across the board and the next MORNING EDITION from NPR\nThis upcoming morning at five o'clock on Houston Public media news eighty eight seven follow us on Facebook it Houston Public media and treat us and it's used in the media it's eleven twenty two\n[noise] and Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line\nWe're talking what we're talking here the woman\nAnd maybe a year of the nervous man at least in terms of politics [laughter] so nervous I Can't say but I Can't even read these words with me in the studio our democratic strategist elections Grinnell high right host of WNYC the United states of anxiety and from Washington Republican strategist Sam Donaldson\nAnd we're taking your calls at age four four seven four or five\nEight to five five to ... in bed sty thanks for calling in\nThanks for having me when I saw the Kavanaugh performance what's really offended but not at all to buy a nice to see this kind of behavior from people like him\nAnd uh I thought that the president if he's giving you a recommendation when you have allegations of sexual assault you're in trouble\nFor the man photo does not stand for president of the United states it's land of the you have a of the United states\nOkay not going to come in or out of the bar let me ask you a question\nDo do you think that um if judge Kavanaugh were not a white male that he would be able to\nGive that forty five minute statement that in in the way that he gave it a last there's\nWhere I'm based on how Tom let's clarify just do some it's right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think south aren't yet they're pecking\nIt something way down the list they get into what you were saying he said that his answer was kind of he said kind of a house which is was interesting uh it made\nIt it made me very curious to hear more about that because he actually called in very willing to have the conversation in a way that we're not having that conversation nationally and when I referred to the fact that there needs to be sort of spaces and constructive places and wish to discuss the stuff we don't have that at an adult and sensitive public discourse right now\nOn a in Beverly New Jersey has called in on a thank you for calling into America on the line hide hide so where are you in this whole conversation\nI'm the mother of a twenty year old son who is currently away at college um and I'm happy that America has has come around to having the conversation\nBut I've had with him since you know he hit puberty and that is you're responsible for your actions it's about time that young men no matter what happens with the capping off situation and everything else that young men in our society start thinking the way young women\nHave been thinking for hundreds of years and I would I Do right now can be kind of ...\nOn a thank you very much for calling into America on the line I mean that right there guy you you were reacting on a ...\nThat's that's exactly right you know I mean the the point is that we as a society are we have reached a place a where\nWomen and people of color in larger and larger numbers are no longer willing to accept that we're the only people who are going to carry the burden of America's problems\nThat we are not whether they'd be cultural economic political that we're not going to be the only people to carry the problems and so we have called the question on a whole lot of stuff you know and prior to this\nIs the dream act and the dream movement is called into question on the way we do with immigration black lives matter started calling the question the way we do with black bodies and in the last years really since Donald Trump's election but certainly in the last year women of all races are calling the question on on on men in their entitlement to women's bodies and so\nYeah that is going to cause some conflict um but but hopefully\nThat conflict and we'll get assigned to a different place\nOnly real quickly to bill in Britain in New Jersey who's called into America on the line bill\nAre we doing good so ... go ahead and that\nOh well not just pretty much just kind of this ad is\nIt is kind of funny weird how we're going to have this conversation ... ... and all the ... and having this ordeal I'm\nSure there was no white privilege if there was no wealthier rich or wealthier white men getting ahead so for why is this even industry\nWhy they didn't have the same issue with Bill Cosby had no issue with a media thing TMZ the whole nine yards there was no political aspect was when it comes to a white man for for some reason now all of a sudden it's a big ordeal to where they just have to push through there's no evidence\nThey don't need to worry about anything and it's just it's mind boggling that they're even allowing us to go through\nOh I Am so wait so ... so you have a problem with ... you are questioning the allegations that are within the accusations against judge Kavanaugh and their timing\nAnd the ... over them as compared to ... because of his privilege because he's white compared to\nWhat happened with Bill Cosby and others is that what you're saying\nExactly oh I Know obviously the Supreme Court justice go over the means to him and his two different levels obviously but it happens so much look at the ... Turner case part of this could get as much time\nAnd obviously the Republicans had no problem bringing about stuff like that because of how many years ago you know when the news at all just kind of places to say oh there's been going on a ... meter nominal comment earlier that oh we have to prove ourselves in a sense of it was innocent until proven guilty\nRight bill I ... I Want to because they only have like a a Ninety seconds left in an election says is camping at the bit to get in here I Want to thank you very much for calling in\nSure I just had a quick fact check you mentioned rocket Turner who of course only got three months for rape so just to be clear there is a if just as a fact check we need to understand that brought Turner white Stanford\nSwimmer I got the ... inning incredibly short sentence for a rape and the judge who in fact issue that sentence was called by California is in a historic vote for actually I went they viewed as a deep miscarriage of justice [noise]\nUm and I do think the question about whether or not\nI guess I'm a little confused um if it happened I was privileged essentially is protecting him here even now since he has the president backing him up and\nRight but I'm not the way that's not the way Bill Bill is looking at a Cairo quickly and then we go to Sam before we go\nOh say one thing that has been quite a satisfying in the lab in recent days he's around Bill Cosby that there was a real conversation in the black community around you know what he needs to be held accountable to uh and so um I I Will agree with him at least that much from bill that regardless of who you are you should be able to come for this\nAnd Sam I'm a I'm In the thirty seconds that we have left if he would do you think senators flake and Collins and Murkowski will vote in favor of Kavanaugh if the process um doesn't smell right\nNo I don't I I think this is a\nThis is very difficult to pass accomplices tests or all of a thorough investigation being does a few days even with the resources if Iraq it throws up against the the problem so I think it's a very I think is very much of a wide wash and I was like this this guy has integrity to see through the largest hopefully the\n... high rise Alexis Grinnell thank you very much for being here when we return we'll hear from a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter about how when and

kind of also there's this coming down the pike next year or next out it meant like they have in other countries I think that\nThose will help people through the politics to the real issues\nRussian hacking black males secret meetings at Trump Tower in this still unanswered question of collusion\nThese are the subjects of the Russia investigation and the story of how Russian President Vladimir put and tried to undermine American democracy it's a story so complicated so nuanced that journalists then investigators have yet to get to the bottom of it\nBut you've gotten close few I've gotten closer than Pulitzer Prize winning reporter\nGreg Miller he covers national security for the Washington Post and his new book delves into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen presidential election it's called The Apprentice Russia a Trump Russia and the ... in the ... version of American democracy and I spoke with him earlier today\nPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia and you've reported on it there's been lots of reporting on it but one thing I've been curious about is ...\nHow did the national security um community the people that you cover and have been covering for years how did they react to that July press conference and how\nWhat was the reaction of the national security apparatus globally to hearing what the president of the United states with saying next to the president of Russia\nThat's a that's a great question and it's great the way you frame that we just talked about his visit to the CIA and how\nProblematic that was I mean it's almost like a a book and it shows that even deep into his second year in office um\nHe had he was not behaving any differently he was still saying things that were just as infuriating to the CIA as he had been at the outset there had been no growth right in his understanding of how U.S intelligence agencies work\nNo I'm no increased appreciation for what they do or or their orbit let alone belief in their in their findings um so the reaction of Helsinki was um I think by and large people thought I saw that as I'm\nAs one of the most troubling episodes they had ever witnessed in terms of an American president standing beside another leader for an adversary of the United states and doing everything to side with that person over the United states government\nWhen it in the little time that we have left tried to do something of a of a rapid fire a series of questions have you seen evidence that not only the Russians interfered in the twenty sixteen election but they also succeeded in changing vote totals\nI think that that's almost impossible to prove but almost impossible to deny at this point uh it just do the numbers are overwhelming we know that Facebook put ... more than a hundred million Facebook users so Russian propaganda tearing down Hillary Clinton helping Donald Trump this was an election decided by fewer fewer than eighty thousand voters you do the math\nPresident Trump it focuses on the steel Ducey a like a laser beam um says it's fake but\nFrom your reporting if the dust ca fake\nI mean the dot CA is raw kind of it's a it's a sort of a private companies version of raw intelligence and a lot of it you know a lot of it remains I'm substantiated for instance we still don't know whether it's true that there that the Kremlin has some videotape or some other evidence of Trump with prostitutes in a room at the risk Carlton we don't know\nUm but a lot of the broad sweep of it has turned out to be accurate right the ... from the very first men on the Steele dossier it was describing a concerted campaign by Russia to throw the election that Trump\nAnd for those who are listening who side with the president and believe the president when he says that this whole Russia thing is a witch hunt is a hoax what would you say to them it's absolutely not I mean I think that\nWe know so much more now I mean there there were certain T a year ago there is infinitely greater certainty now the mall or indictments have have been so compelling\nThat even CIA officials I talked to her astonished at the level of detail that Mueller has assembled that shows the involvement of Russian intelligence officials right down to the keyboards that they were using right to send this\n... this disinformation into the United states have the Russian stopped [noise]\nNo no I mean I think that\nThis was a perfect storm and twenty sixteen it's hard to know whether Russia could ever have\nThat kind of success again it was a confluence of a bunch of different things including their ideal candidate it's hard to know how they would fair you know trying to influence a mid term election in the United states or whether they could get away with it a second time around in the presidential contests I\nMean we know that they've tried at least Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri has announced that the Russians I'm tempted to hack her Senate computer network or have you heard of or been made aware of other efforts in other states in this mid term elections\nOh yeah I think that there's there's a consensus that it's still under ... and ... and it just makes so much sense Jonathan ... what would why wouldn't Russia I mean what does its experience are coming out of twenty sixteen this was an enormously successful operation with very little cost for Russia\nGreg Miller national security reporter for the Washington Post two time Pulitzer Prize winner and all throughout The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy thank you

Michael ... vice president for development and Hilton Hotels business thank you [noise]\n\nRight now to an item which begs for a sound effects introduction but we mustn't because we don't want to break the little uh we're talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often all American radio and TV channels sound a squawking grating alarmed to test the system which\nIn theory would be used with us everyone to a threat\nUh obviously we don't want to cause any alarmed by playing the alarm so we're just going to talk about the alum there's a new addition to it to keep up with the times\nRichard ... is a former director of global counterterrorism operations for the British secret intelligence service and my six\nAnd he joins us now on the line from Tanzania to talk about this issue just give us a broad overview remaining and expanding is the uh the idea the aspiration does that describe the situation in East Africa [noise]\nYes it does the group started in East Africa in about twenty Fifteen and October twenty Fifteen so they have managed to survive now for three years despite the\nMisfortune instead of a code for the rest of the Islamic state [noise] and um I Can't say that that big I can't say that an immediate threat and I can't say that they're actually doing very much for them but\nNonetheless the fact that they do exist in East Africa I think is something that one needs to take account\nAnd one of the things I mean obviously but we so often talk about al Shabaab and the dominant presence in Somalia and so on and they all one of the enemies of Islamic state so they also got a beleaguered on all sides how do they survive [noise]\nYes that's right our Shabaab because of a much bigger very much more powerful and would not tolerate the presence of Islamic state 'cause they thought it was a real threat\nBut I guess at the moment it survives because it's a manageable threats it's manageable for al Shabaab and it's managed both for the federal government to some other and this ... for the ... than government\nSo ... you know nobody's can be sort of positive enough to go and beat up on it also of course fits nicely you know within the clown dynamics and everything in ... where it where to excess ...\nWhy does it exist precisely that tell us more about the situation in Portland\nBut I think that two reasons festival it hangs out in very inaccessible area of ... and and that's quite how to attack and drive out\nSecond is the uh local kind of the other side of the sub on quite a few of the Islamic state senior members and members as a clown and so they have a sort of\nSet toleration I I Would say by the local population and said the capacity of the ... on government to really do anything about it is relatively restricted so I think everybody reckons well okay it's not so much of a threat that we need to divert resources to deal with\nYou seem to be suggesting that it's a sort of a clown based affiliation rather than anything else is there anything about the ideology that means that it can appeal to a particular group all differentiated so for example from the Ames and methods of Shabaab\nIs I think you're quite right I think the only way that it can really thrive as by managing to be different from ... to similar to al Shabaab at the moment and it has to break out from that sort of structure of\nSocial structures that exist in some out there in order to be able to attract recruits from elsewhere it has managed to do that for a little bit and it has had one or two people returning from Iraq Syria for example joined its ranks and if it manages to do that successfully then it could present a real threat not justice money to other countries beyond\nUm what does it need to do however I mean surely it's USB as being rather exploded and damaged by the end of the so called ... so how does it then advertise itself what does it end point you know what is what is the tomorrow that it's promising\nYes in the role of the Islamic state certainly has been decimated and is\nOn its last legs but his propaganda rapid still exists on Islamic states and some other has managed to tap into that propaganda ref can't get his message out and oil really has to do is to tell people it's there and that if you can make your way to joined us that's fine you'll be very welcome of course that's easier said than done\nBut uh it's got a little bit of money not very much Scott ... not very good ones\nUm and at the moment it doesn't have a very strong ideological presidents but\nIts leader is thought to be rather ... they may not survive and the trench of leadership may provide it with more of a momentum as it moves into a new phase\n[noise] fascinating background many thanks indeed Richard Barrett former director of global counterterrorism operations for the or am I six the British secret intelligence service somebody a survival in East Africa largely in Portland as you heard that of Islamic state [noise]\nAnd it led and the guy had about the u._s. testing these to text messages for serious emergencies not we can hear about another place they've already being used during a crisis together health information during the vote outbreak in Liberia a couple of years ago\nA new study from the New York University College of global public health at NYU tendon school of engineering you text message surveys to determine in real time how people use maternal health services during that about outbreak some more I've been speaking to the senior author of the study ...\nYou're in Ebola outbreak like other um emergency situations in public health it's really important to know how people are using healthcare services you know can we can be sure they're getting the care that they need\nAnd actually in you know a huge nations like they can send these outrageous heading like Liberia where you know the health care infrastructure in sneak and if they're not using healthcare during an outbreak that can actually of course catalyzed for their health issues\nBut also it kind of a mission understand it because it could be a lost track or in terms of health care what I understand why that is the weekend or mitigate that and it turns out to care people get\n... and sending text messages it allows things to be done much quicker than traditional methods\nThat resulted in yet new data or see how they can compliment I think public health sources and of course in Iraq in ... you can get ... message in for like the all time so that in appropriately to 'em you think are probably a way I don't understand how can he can behavior in Iraq\nHow can you make sure that you target the right people that you get in terms of numbers of the people you need to get hold of to cover a broad enough ah sway the community for example\nThat that's very good questions do these days number actually not a problem because like you can imagine so many people have mobile phone even in a little leans our study like like\nYuri ... are being even really eerie Liberia but there's still an issue because the people who use mobile phone might be of course a little bit in front of the people who don't use that and so we had to use them\nMatches Hackney faster to make sure the pot and look at some samples from the people that data from the mobile phone to make sure that makes sense for the you know the larger population\nYeah cause I can imagine in a place like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network maybe in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people need to help most are the ones you find the most difficulty reaching\nYes no of course they're important especially in these situations but we have to be a kind of puts you in a little ... for example over sample and places where it's more ... there'll be less\nAnd then we had a cat into account characteristics of people not just um one thing we're finding in terms of their health care but you know what they're still your economic where and other things to make sure we're getting information I think I think in a distribution pending back within the population\nAnd I wonder how these text messages because in ... in many places it seems to me the ... the tax is the way of getting information around quickly\nYeah exactly you know these kinds of things are always changing what people are using for our T\nTechnician for okay maybe a really good you know samples people\nBecause it's still possible for people to get ten messages sent me given incentives to people and during the survey they would get some amount of air time they'll that and it was a little bit incentive to respond to that you've been definitely people you know and I think into the research exploring these impersonal like one that other kind of\nA new technologies would be important to augment you know our ... our public health ethics as well\nAs ... as she says yeah the idea is that it can be used in other crises\nAround the globe is well on the way we talk about the green Sahara a fascinating period in history and how humans\nAre back then this is tens of thousands of years ago ... than humans now at managing does is it because you should also feel as you say not report on the way and also we go to Texas as well so it looks to dump plus this boat but now we're going to cost to the states within two to one of the journalists behind\nThe big story in the New York times and in the American media which is an investigation into President Trump's family and that tax schemes which greatly benefited the president of the report talks about Donald Trump receiving large amounts of money from his parents are nothing wrong with that of course as you were about to hear\nA but it sort of contradicts the image that was presented to being a self made man who only started with a million builders those are his words not mine a\nPresident Trump's lawyers as ... a responded to the times story saying the allegations of fraud and tax evasion all one hundred percent bulls\nAnd highly disarm a tree so far the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs because who just spoke to one of the journalists who had the story David Boston\nReveals too important one is it reveals that the central narrative that Donald Trump has told throughout his life and especially in his political can't pay the price of a narrative that she is a self made\nBillionaire basically started with a million dollar loan from his\nFather drove your car but that narrative active actually completely at odds with the record itself the earth my record of many tens of thousands of pages of documents from inside the real estate empire drug Trump the father\nAnd and and as Margaret Thatcher said the problem with socialism eventually run out of the people [noise]\nIn the bars and so it's basically will ruin used to talk of the town\nOn

under investigation at the moment in connection with some form of corruption and this week to the country's most recent presidents have been further implicated Brazilians say they have had it with corruption and the polls suggest that directing their votes accordingly too was\nFar left and far right wing candidate\nSome Brazilian businesses have joined the push to clean up the system they found it a school for only ... new politicians as they describe with a high profile initiative with dozens of graduates running for office this year the BBC's die no got us has been speaking to some of them\nHave have\nI think in the great just the volatile area in politicians here campaigning door to door for a vote the final week of general elections in\nBrazil this kind of look for in about a few of them I don't think that's\nHow I feel like I said it's only five thousand people here in Brazil where we took a lot of classes talking about politics is talking about the system how it works how to be a politician Brazil what is important to know on this election\nIn a kind of ... as he points the nine year old engineer reading her first campaign for Congress seat she's talking about her experience with hitting all of a ... a school set up by business people who want to forge a new generation of leaders\nShouldn't as highly skilled with Colombia an Oxford in her ... in the private sector should be the dream of recruiters but not in Brazilian politics why\nGo into politics in the country that is so corrupt like resume\nEcstatic because it's so corrupt it's very very important for us to be part of the system in order to chit chatted ... know that it's a lot of chaos here so that's why we new faces with new project with new views have to be part of this in order to change it\nAnd what do you think you can do differently in the system that ultimately is very corrupt for everyone I Would\nSay that is very very important you change for electoral system because it only for tax the old politicians I think this must be the focus we have to change that before I before king everything out\n\nOf the families\nWho to talk of the political reform the deaths of corruption in President politics is astonishing let's take the twenty sixteen ... former president ... set for instance you're hearing the conversation and the fact\nThat she really you know the ruling\nAnd opposition parties both the ousted and the new president absolutely everyone was involved in graft scandals half of all five hundred and Thirteen Brazilian and peas in Congress are currently under investigation for corruption [noise]\nSo it's not just a few corrupt politicians are parties in Brazil it's a whole system that's rocks and\nWhat we're trying to accomplish here is to change the dynamics of Brazilian politics by bringing new blood with extremely qualified people ... to a Brazilian politics\nIt's hard to ... years working with private equity but last year she got fed up with business as usual it's NGO slash school for politicians cutting off ... teaches people how to fund and run their campaigns specialists are brought in to help people identify unethical pitfalls\nPowder you spots of the good politician the person who is is a good candidate a good fit for your school\nI Would say three major characters the first is resilience\nYou have to keep your head up and you know there will be ups and downs second point is ah having like a history of delivering not a history of just talking you know we believe that we need to people who can roll up the sleeves and get things done the target is the willingness to serve\nSo we believe that we need to bring that back to the table and so people understand that they when they are voting for someone they're hiring someone to do the job that they can do\nBut even if they're very qualified people it's a very tough systems to get in because there's a lot of corruption and those were corrupt to have a lot of advantages and does so can an honest person make it in this world at least enter politics\nI think they can if you do any research we've Brazilian food or do they do essentially give you two answers that they're fed up with the current politicians\nAnd the dude like to see new practices and new individuals and we felt we had to start somewhere\nSo the political renovation which is an aspiration of the president's society as a whole we'll start in this two thousand and Eighteen election and will most likely continue and will grow over the next two years\nBusiness minded what a ... speaking to the BBC thing again is that\nWell there's a reason corruption in Brazil is so deep seated with the state to huge employer in many parts of the country and the allocation of state contracts in the hands of the few elected officials politicians are in a position to siphon off huge sums if they want to\nTo finance their reelection campaigns Sarah mostly the correspondent for the economist magazine in Brazil as seen this breast self when she visited the town of ... in the country's northeast\nField a ton of our own twenty eight thousand people and the poor northeastern state of ... and basically the morning I got there I plan to spend the day with the city council loan and by nine in the morning he had\nOf people lined up outside his house very poor people with little ... to pay for their\nPrescription medicines receipt for X rays and other medical procedures their gas and electricity bills you know the ... century just knowing that there was an election coming up and there was kind of an exchange that went on where he took care of these\nFinancial problems they hadn't paid their bell with the kind of implicit promise that they would support in the election and\nThis is a town where the biggest employers the mayor's office you is actually a rival to the confidence that I was with and you know across town the mayor's office or is it in the basket\nAnd so people are buying well politicians local politicians are effectively buying votes I guess because they control the mayor's office and in Brazil controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nI think they said what's going on and actually outright ...\nAnd as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or or twenty five\nDollars and then what happens is the mayor of this town basically tries to get all of the people living in this town to vote for the politicians that he's in a coalition with an in this case it's\nA prominent senator and a congressman and she depends on them to be able to get federal money to do projects and give these kinds of handouts and then higher\nThey depend on all of these small scale mayors to get the votes that are needed to keep to re electing then a lot of them have half a dozen corruption cases\nYes and of course knew where it would be in the world has made corruption cases and seems was the last five or six years of and Brazil has won a national\nPolitical level the anti corruption agenda has defined a large part of this national election though isn't it\nHas indeed and whoever is elected president is going to have a really tough time getting rid of corruption because they're the whole system that breed that and that starts in these little towns and then worked its way out of the things you need to\nUnderstand about Brazil is Brazil has massive electoral districts so everyone in al ago as\nAre voting for the same legislators and in this case there's four hundred and forty different candidates that they're going to have to choose between for various position and that kind of huge array of candidates combined with thirty five political parties\nMeans that elections are really expensive so there's a need for money in some cases from legitimate places and in other cases as the corruption investigations have shown over the past few years it comes from outright\nIt seems almost impossible to anyone and to keep yourself clean\nSome of the politicians who of and a raft and these corruption scandals say it's the system itself that requires that I think that's a bit of a cop out there have been is meant to make elections cheaper\nTo reduce the number of parties and Tunisia ban corporate donations but what's really difficult to all of these reforms once that disgusting Congress they encounter massive resistance from the politicians because of course that quite like this and that kept them in power for so many years\nAnd it's really hard for a reform minded congressman or president as I think we'll see when the election is over to really change the way that\nThat's a good question [laughter] friend of mine wanted to do it and I said that I Would do it with her\nSince it doesn't require a permit
