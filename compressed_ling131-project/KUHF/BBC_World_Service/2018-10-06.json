{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Sort of that these claims so that also is going to create a political problem for the FBI so lots of politics here no way around that given the scope and scale of it right\nYeah um well brand and let me ask you a question arose as Shakespeare said arose by any other name still sit still smells suite isn't NAFTA by the really in art for us MCA name has its or does it\nStill have free trade what what what what do you think we got a new agreement between the U.S Mexico and Canada a\nBig win for president Donald Trump he got the trade agreement he wants\nAnd it really awful name with\nYou how many ... did Shakespeare writes about trade agreements right probably at least a dozen I don't know my English I Am big contaminants I'm sure\nYeah so this is basically the new NAFTA Jay right the new try lateral trade agreement between us and Mexico and Canada it includes a couple of things that I think are worth highlighting\nThat is the case now that automobiles have to have Seventy five percent of the material manufactured in North America this could be a problem if it's the case that that is deemed to be too expensive there are new labor provisions there are also new electoral property in the world trade issues on the um on the agreement which sort of push back on China\nI'm not a trade expert Jay but I think politically as a win for the president right he said he was going to undo NAFTA and or redo NAFTA and effectively that's what he's got\nPolitically depending on what happens in the election the new Congress is going to have to okay this and he may have some pushback from Democrats who don't want to give him to win so I'd say this one's kind of a qualified when we'll see how it actually takes a\nWhile I mean I think it's a big win for him it largely because he had as you said made is a center point of his campaign I mean the big issue that he made with Canada was were were Canadian subsidies to visit their dairy industry he actually won on that\nWhich is a shocker he may end up creating a situation where Justin Trudeau doesn't get reelected in Canada and the level or a government goes down on this very issue how so this was a substantial I think substantial inform\nBut a large part by Ninety percent of the agreements the same so in many ways this is a situation where you know he threw a new name on his on an update of an old agreement and he's calling a brand new I bet there's a bunch of people in the healthcare industry going hey do the same thing with Obamacare\nLet's get Trump care keep Ninety percent of it and everyone will be happy mhm\nThat's probably partially right um now Trump is all in favor of keeping things or at least I'm I'm a big portion of things and we learned this week from ... from the New York times that the president's finances apparently in large part has flown from his family and potentially through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen eighties in Nineteen Ninety so\nWhat do you think of the revelations here what are some of the high point what he the New York times found and do you think it'll have any of what\nI I think I think two two big revelations one anyone who thought that Donald Trump was a self made millionaire slash billionaire\nThey have lost that I could ... yeah I think in real terms he ended up inheriting close to half a billion dollars on money on the other part is is that we now know why he was reluctant I think to release your after tax returns in large part because I think it shows some pretty aggressive\nAnd creative accounting I'm as to how he's valuing properties so we know that the Trump isn't as rich as he says he is and he inherited most of his money and that he's he's been kind of playing fast and loose\nWith his tax returns so all of this I think taken in and told them will probably not amount to much brand and then it's not going to change I think people tend to like the president like him\nThis reinforces what folks who don't like the president or do you think about him\nI'm not quite sure what comes of it unless you think that there's a criminal issue at stake here but yeah it's it just I think feeds the prevailing views that people had a dump\nTruck yeah he's not a self made billionaire he's a dad made billionaire I like that that I like that that that's a ... trademark pending um [laughter]\nAs of this moment yeah I think that I agree with you that that there is zero political effect here or an hatch\nIn particular suggested that he thought that the president should give up these returns but probably wouldn't want to and may not be required to so I just don't think there's any appetite in Congress right now to make this happen especially with the Calvin out here it's going\nLooks like potentially he's hiding something ride the tax turn issue still comes up that you know how much he's dependent on his father's well does he really is riches he says he is um are he does he have debts to foreign countries that could be problematic so legally there could be an issue with respect to like the line between tax avoidance and tax evasion\nBut I Do think for sure at the end of the day we're going to see a hardening with respect to the president's desire or ability or demand to give out the ...\nThe president also shifting gears a bit you know he's been coming under fire for the finances he's been coming under fire kind of his general demeanor that that ... that we talk about on a weekly basis sort of Trump is ... of the week\nI think we've had this massively I think inappropriate Trump ism in where he directly sort of mocked\nDr Ford in a campaign rally really questioning her veracity questioning or authenticity I in the Kavanaugh hearings not a good look for the president United States to be doing this it I'd like to say it's a\nIt's surprising but unfortunately it's really not\nKnow this sucks that came on the heels of him essentially\nAlso mocking a female reporter during a press conference saying something is effective you're not thinking you never do implying that\nFemale reporters aren't as competent as their male counterparts the president seems intent on setting a\nNew record for a gender gap and election right we're already talking about women breaking for Democrats on the generic ballot by plus Fifteen if that number goes to plus twenty than the Republicans are going to be running scared in dozens of more district so this is not helping the Republicans down ballot and is definitely a major problem for the Republicans and the White House\nBrand is shifting gears a bit we had a really I think surprising and\nI think both sad and in some ways uplifting announcement by a former uh Missouri secretary of state and a democratic candidate for the mayor of Kansas City Jason Kander\nUm he he was leading and all the polling almost as a shoe in to win this race in November and he's stepping down from from serving as mayor effectively citing a post traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan I think it's really brave thing that he's doing is really trying to call attention to the needs of not just veterans but people that are that there is no shame in having mental health crisis but it's something needs to be treated and solved\nI think that's you're exactly right this is sad to see but he is fundamentally brave for doing this and I think that the Democrats want to see him get as healthy as the rest of us do because in some ways he has cemented the reputation of being a kind of playing talking red state progressive the kind of\nCandidate for Democrats that can appeal to people in the heartland and if you have seen if you if you haven't seen pause the pod cast go in Google Search Jason Kander ad where he assembles assault rifle it's a thing to behold he does it blindfolded while talking I couldn't even life\nChew gum [laughter] and rub my head at the same time and if you can assemble this assault rifle and so it's a really fascinating for a political point of view but from a medical point of view I think we all hope he gets fatter and this I think you're right is a good signal that there's always time to get free\nWell shifting gears a bit to the red state progressive here in Texas I'm ... and he is challenging of course a Senator Ted Cruz lots of little things happening here a brand and what's going on\nYeah well one that popped up for me was that are in Nineteen Ninety One apparently Nineteen year old Robert or Rourke writing under the name Robert or work which is worth noting reviewed uh the Broadway musical the will Rogers Follies in Columbia daily spectator he had some very pointed things to say about the people in fact\nBroadly suggesting this is part of the sickening excesses and moral degradation is of our culture I mean it's will Rogers\nObviously overloaded he's a college student right then he complained about the quote permit smile actresses who was only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large breasts and type products\nJ what do you think about this is going to have an effect on the ascendency of or work in democratic circles or is the apology that he gave sufficient\nI mean I I don't think it's going to have any effect at all I think it's one more fodder and you know now that we're going back into looking into everyone's passed on everything I think in the grand scheme of things that probably doesn't particularly in the case of of O'Rourke who's got\nA you know obviously issues with the the the DUI incidents in criminal justice incidents that that had happened that he's already explained I'm\nWell now he's explaining more though right so they want to do to a better what they did to Obama right and that is basically paint him as somebody who is sort of on a so this plays into that right every week or some new revelations that\nHe did something as a young person that maybe people look at as being problematic I think that can have a ... like a a kind of a cumulative effect if you multiply it over the course of many of these ...\nYeah I mean that's possible but I think I think the issue for for them as the nature of this particular thing sort of takes to shine a little bit off of or or yeah but I mean the alternative is still Ted Cruz and so I'm not sure that voters that are attracted to them maybe they do stay home as a result of this of of what he did Nineteen\nYes he apologized I think what it says to me is a cruise\nOpposition research folks are working overtime pay for ... and they have done a masterful job of the last few weeks which stood out to me was there\n\nYes OJ one of the biggest races it I think kind of slipped under the radar for most people is the attorney general's race you've got Justin Nelson who's an attorney from Austin running against Ken Paxton whose the indicted current member of an attorney general so what do you make of the ...\nWhat a couple of things one as you said a Ken Paxton who just love to see the Obama administration and has really been this costs eleven litigants\nOn all things a sort of kicking back against ah against the federal government\nHis entire term has been under indictment and under criminal indictment for securities fraud Yeah John I'm so Justin Nelson is a a successful lawyer or in the Austin Houston area law professor at the University of Texas first time candidate\nHas a lot of money and put a lot of his own in this race is competitive for a couple of reasons one you said at first but Ken Paxton is indicted remotely indicted attorney general who essentially can't\nGo before a Texas judge because he's under indictment under the shape our rules the optics are not ... not there but doesn't stop him from filing lawsuits left and right\nNow soon as it is not known him I think the whole issue is whether or not he has the resources to kind of make himself no right now so there's this very much a vote against Paxton we they knew we know from the polling that's been done on the race that pretty much the races a one to two to three point raised within the margin of error\nAnd that reflects I think the disliked towards facts in more than anything else\nActions not really running the race that you would've expected he's not trying to hit notes in order to find him the way she cruises on with the work\nI think is a competitive race this might be sort of the sneaky race that people don't see the the larger turnout that you see as a result of this the U.S Senate race might help them yeah it might help but notice him sort of get under the wire huge ramifications because\nThe attorney general and not only deals with things like law suits for on immigration issues or the Affordable CARE Act also does redistricting and does other things that deal with the way the state of portions\nDevote a well nothing's wrong a clever campaign I think right he's got these ads that talk about Ken packs and being indicted there's the Ken Paxton don't steal this Penn Penn have you seen these right there was this or have little dust up where it can packs and apparently\nI'm Scott and with a pen there was expensive from the colon county courthouse they run ads that have like a a birthday cake for the indictment on a date\nAfrican pack them so there's some I think clever stuff that is the kind of thing that would be good to crime Democrats to think about this race and possibly give Republicans some pause but I think you're exactly right look packs and has taken the lead on all kinds of issues the Democrats are guys right challenging DACA\nHe defended the requirements to say the pledge of allegiance which we talked about a couple of weeks ago do in constructed county court ... court decision on same sex marriage right he's ruled um that\nThat paid sick leave was unlawful here's a prime democratic target\nMy question is where all the Democrats run\nAgain I I I agree I mean my my question on that as an I ... it has been\nJustin Nelson is a great candidate in terms of just a profile you would think that there would be\nJust money left over right you're thrown at him yeah there's a lot of money going to some of these congressional races in districts that frankly are very very hard for Democrats to be competitive and a lot of that money going to Justin Nelson\nCould potentially flip maybe the most important race outside of the governor's race or a U.S Senate race for Democrats because of the long term impact\nNotes into good candidate he and he just probably needs a a few more resources I'm surprised you don't see third parties and independent expenditure packs getting involved in here and I'm Still waiting for ... spend some money but guess what he doesn't have any because a lot of his money is going to his own criminal defense well\nHe's got about six million dollars on hand so yeah some of it's going to be used for that but I'm the fact that he is a very\nWell I can come and specially amongst Republicans and especially among conservative\nEvangelical Republicans it's really difficult to get him out of there but I think that for Nelson the further you are down the ballot the harder it is to get your race on the top of voters' minds so telling people about what the office does and then informing them about what\nCan pack and it's been up to and then talking about your credentials I think it just takes too much\nHere's the other thing too although work has been a real boon for the Democrats he's also taken a lot of the oxygen out of the room right so the fact that he is gets all the attention I think in some ways kind of chokes\nThe ability for resources or attention towards these other down ballot races so there's a bit of a catch twenty two there for for them and I think Nelson like you say is a good candidate it's a race to watch because it could be that there is a difference here between like what the other statewide officials get and what he gets but at the end of day it's still really tall for\nWell that's it for this week party politics is recording to George VI Gary

basically there's a contradiction here with the constitution which the draft is um and backers of this referendum at trying to find out but already gay people in Romania as in many countries in Eastern Europe feel they're not welcome they're ostracized\nI'm there have been cases uh graffiti being painted on ... and and just in general it's not very comfortable to be a gay person in Romania

down up above\nUs without akin to Rebecca ... reporting from sort of way see Indonesia Emma you were talking about your time in that part of the world and covering Indonesia specifically what was your assessment then of the level of disaster preparedness in the country that faces this kind of thing so often\nWhat exactly I mean it's all ... between the teen and Seventeen thousand islands has a hundred and forty seven active volcanoes it it it's bound to have disasters happening\nI'm I was actually struck I mean I I went to not paper last year up to ... you might remember Mbali a gun was was was due to explain it to well everyone was being evacuated I was in the opposite direction which could from puzzled look some tourist off can you where I was getting I said I'm going up to the ... um and\nWhat I was struck there is actually how they were really despite having limited constraints of being a not a very rich country by by some measures\nAnd they were trying to to to to sort of prepared for these things as effectively as they could\nUh and the ... people that I spoke to seem spent half of that time traveling between different ... that we're about to explode\nAnd the difficulty is also is that I think in this case it was evident that the monitoring systems went whacking but the difficulty also is when do they cool when did when they made the cool because if you evacuate people too early and then nothing happens as invoking people people believe it less next time\nAnd that's when dangerous things can happen and when people can move back into the home to the base of Kenya for example an excellent\nUm so I was struck by by basically you know how how how difficult it is to get around to the needs are and how they were spending my time doing that\nBut also how they have to sort of balance or that that sort of monitoring systems but also with the human the human story of how do you how do you tell people soon enough or how do you make sure that you don't get the full ...\nUh Patricia what struck you as you as you've watched this unheard [noise]\nWell I don't want to be too much with the center but it does seem to me that we seem to be well able to run for the last ... but not quite the next\nAnd certainly I mean in the country in the hurricanes and getting worse and worse and it's it's how do you plan to that I mean I have a real confidence of people who live in the tropics that the there's resilience because they had to come spot quite quickly and you know you don't need as much else perhaps invested the things but\nIt it it's to me is concerning that teen things seem to fall apart more drastically and pops is because we were so much closer with the news that it seems to be getting worse and worse and that's my Cassandra mum\nSecured outta Cassandra members just wonder whether or not in any part of the world a government sees it as often it deals with it as often as best it can it hopes another one way to cook and therefore the money perhaps isn't pledged in the way he needs to be\nI mean I I didn't think it needs to necessarily has enough money to for natural disasters so that needs help from elsewhere I think any ... and and I think that that help has been I as I understand it has been ... at the ... not the right thing is that can eat but it's going to be a big test for president Jacoby he faces and action next year\nI'm I've had this been a lot of backlash to towards him in some ways the which is one of the poor islands as well and I'm so he will be really trying to sort this out on the

British governments to call ... ... places of terms to undermine international law\nInternational institutions Russia ... behavior\nOr listening registers Hackman he was a research fellow at ... and co editor of the journal of cyber policy welcome drinks you were you surprised by go court\nWell actually I'm I must say that uh what's been going on with the attribution and and so forth is not read it and you think I think what's new is like you know the kind of\nCoordinated accusations\nAre it is quite surprising given the level of the Russian sophistication that they were called ...\nBut I Believe you know when the uh intelligence agencies from different countries they come together and they ... you know a a says there had an investigation altogether that gives them you know like it better or put them in a better place to be able to achieve results and therefore we saw what we saw a yesterday\nAnd what does this tell you about the scale of water might be going on behind the scenes you\nWell I mean if you look at a where the Russians are attacks have taken place you know they've ah went against like organizations in uh in Canada and the U.S and met Asia and Brazil and switch that land and and and the Netherlands in the u._k.\nSo they've been keeping everyone quite busy or an eye that basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how uh how much like fiber to his now are very much\nAt an essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a foreign policy agenda and they use it quite at all and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts on I ... that they want to achieve\nAnd all those potentially being spied a poem able to resist first tools effectively\nWell basically I mean uh if you ... the thing is with the outside with crimes inside the taxes like more often than not uh they will be like you know what I read the infiltrate into the system without you know you knowing about it\nSo it's very challenging to know about all the infiltration into their systems but\nOf course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of like raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think even though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame of the nation\nThat is that does cause adaptation of damage and that does to the late Saturday the way for a more economic sanctions which would be like really a challenge for the Russian economy now\nLet me bring my guessing to maybe ... of course you know what's on your mind\n[noise] well I was struck I mean I'm I'm a big fan of John le Carre and and and I don't know much about sort of modern the modern equivalent of fine but I was struck by the ... are released by the I think the Netherlands I'm\nSort of at least about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to go ... full of equipment or a jacket covering an antenna\nAnd and that they were sort of they came on to on diplomatic passport but presumably would would trace from from that from the beginning so\nIt seems strange to me that we're talking about cyberattacks but then it had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how most of them are done or is is is that are just ... by by that these ...\nI Believe like you know these sort of attacks that combined both uh I was reading so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combine it with online activity or what happened yesterday with it of relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for Russians and that it just because they are they've been very keen and the recent years to show supremacy and ... and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know all these things and what if your car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless I Am going on from the Russian policy but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and then you know a sooner or later you would leave some\nAh you know in the distance wide I Would call them ditch the bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then ah basically lead to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the uh these uh spies ... in April and only had about\n... yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of ah\nCoordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm\nJust on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives ... incentive we don't know if I smoke on a sort of been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nMaybe it dominates our image you know and that really it's a big ... to talk about the popular ones you know and that's why the ... ... ... ... it was a lot of sexual relationship everybody knows about it or

what would happen if you went back now [noise]\nI'm not sure or you can go by the president is if you can uh come out again\nThat would be your fear that you wouldn't be able to put their risk and do you think of film like this can change anything in terms of the way a country like Iran operates at the moment I think\nA ... or ... or the artist cannot really change something directly but they can ask questions and I think if we can ask the same question to the audience and\nAnd the audience in each each person asked the same question him says a start to change his mind set so we can change of

even able to to carry out that activity the Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists\nAnd they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women ... where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually product at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... say the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as if we can beat the unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term at five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nAnd did you find differences according to age\nYes we did and they were quite different from what people generally tend to expect so we found a more ah reports of loneliness and people age between sixteen and twenty four years old so younger adults are than an older an older people in effect it is intended to go down with age\nAnd that will surprise a lot of people I think because I was a stereotype of the older isolated lonely person\nYes there is and of course we do also have long enough in older age out and bought at what our data is showing his is downward trend and this is of course a self selected sample so not everybody who is in a different age groups is represented in in our sample but it's very comparable to what was recently found\nYou know a large a survey by the off the u._k. office of national statistics at which is a representative sample of the u._k. population and so we we are fairly confident that this is not complete fiction it is a really what people are feeling\nAnd were you surprised that more young people told us that they felt lonely time isn't it when people are having a lot of transitions they might be moving away to college all the new jobs leaving that friends\nYes so the first thing to think about is that is it is there's maybe a generational issue is it maybe the younger people now of today are different from the younger people of of other ... and therefore maybe those ... those younger people are by these are older and that's where the differences are coming from\nI think we can safely say that's not the case and one of the reasons why we can say that is that we also asked participants to reflect on their life\nAnd to think about what were the times in which they felt more lonely and all participants of old age tended to say that he was exactly when they are and when they were young adults\nSo that that fits with what we actually found when people reported their own loneliness\nSo then we need to think about what is it about that age that might be associated with loneliness and indeed the things you were saying so transitions leaving home for the first time entering higher education or entering a job all of those transitions are changing your identity or sense of who you are\nAnd the way you relate to others because that is very identity base as well but also your social networks they're breaking informing breaking informing at that time it's a time full of instability\nWhen he was some students at Yale University and then ... and who do seem to know what it's like to feel lonely\nI was really excited to go to you know the state because at some of what issue for ages\nBut I feel like I've built up too much in my head and I sort of like\nNot quite disappointed when I got hit but like I think precious week is really oversold like free to best week your life on the oh your friend and I was a bit so of underwhelming by ... I Wish I push myself out and ... to me I think loneliness is sort of\nFeeling like you want to be able to talk to people but not knowing how like I'd looked just like sort of superficial acquaintance e friendships but\nI don't mind if you look at everybody talks about ...\nMore than I mean it's about ... no free lunch you were part of the community that you're in very limited\nOstracized if you're on the weekends I struggle friends all around as much I Do like Sundays I I've been to families as well so I definitely shovel and fun days went on how much going on\nA remote as well so let me but for the loans or a very devoted to the parents are just ... food food or do you live at all if people can reach ... food if I was eating circular\nMy what I Know it's just a law student I mentioned that it doesn't always last long so maybe it's a very normal thing to feel at that age and can often be temporary\nYeah so that's that's another reason that I think we are seeing such high levels of loneliness and younger people is that\nAh when when they experience it they don't realize necessarily that this is something that can often be temporary\nAnd they also don't haven't rehearsed different ways of coping with it and what works and what doesn't which in itself might make it last longer so the whole intensity of the experiences is is higher because of course you don't know you can get out of it to or how to get out of it\nSo yeah that's very much that's very recognizable\nIs it possible that older people might feel lonely and the same numbers but failed\nYeah ... ... I don't want to say in a study that I feel and me\nIt's very possible of course because there is indeed a perceived stigma associated with loan innocent by that I mean that people have the idea that if you admit to learn in us and then you will be seen as somehow we Korean adequate and we did ask about that and we did find that I was a stronger among older people so it's very possible that\nUm it's it's not entirely clear why that is not the case as much in younger people of course\nI'm a buck but didn't do that was the case what's also interesting to think about is that we did try to to delve into that stigma and try to see well are people who admit to being lonely\nOr really and negatively evaluate that are seen as weak arena adequate and we actually found no evidence for that so our participants are fifty five thousand participants were generally very kind about uh other people who feel lonely and very um positive about them wanting to reach out and help\nSo it is perceived stigma but not so much stigma that actually exists and I think that's interesting to to speak about so that people realize it actually isn't as bad as they think\nAnd of course it's not a competition between the ages and if you do feel any than a ... ever age you are now some older people such as Ninety six year old Jack King isolated because that no longer so mobile I went to meet him in a time where he lives on the south coast\nOf England [noise]\nReally nice to meet you I live\nIn fear [noise] Murtha is as a prisoner of war\nThat has a role that's my whole life or does it bought from Boston wow that's a pretty big piece of wrong about that last last you know real for food but I'd have a lot of forward testicle or others are rooted in the last hour before the ghost in the pool\nNow there's no doubt that Jack is someone who's ... during his three years as a prisoner of war during World War two he put in place for the other prisoners fashioning stage ... out of rice facts he also knew how to set up a ... pie when food with gas\nBut also the ball he's busy life has been dominated by one relationship with his wife Audrey\nOn my ... ... method my marriage in September a quick America for sixty five years wow she passed away I ... this year\nAnd was that when you started to feel lonely and saying huh\nOh yes audited whereabouts afterwards because there's two ... I'll be everywhere we used to drive to get her she was about a little bit\nYou know do they all say about\nTroubles shares a troubled falls which happens to share this happened just doubled show true sure [noise]\n\nThe Jack the days alone he's three sons do for a lot and someone comes in for two hours a day to help out but it's still leaves many long hours when he liked to have company so he looks for distractions like composing music on the organ painting and watching books\nThe write poetry as well and you've written a prime pulled loneliness till\nA tool to myself because I listen to me\nI took myself but I'm the only show I told to purchase and the whole way instead of from the river that hangs on the whole British though with a tool for looking at them and see if there is no um but we\nAre told from us so in the middle of my mind when there's nobody there to hear what type fraud sort of stage for forty hours of sunshine and shows I converse with the window and door just feeling the carpet for us to watch a phenomenon and they\nAre mobile Marcel form lush dust Dale shells just made a model and company\nThey talk about the night that the is there a particular time of day all evening with with\nNo ... or something to [noise]\nSo we asked you to keep a diary for us for a day and I'm going to get you to read that diary now a second\nIs six to the sun has not yet clear the eastern horizon and that begins the houses are silent to sleeping in this overload\nA few known sin glows low low in the eastern SCA moved bought the beauty of the morning and wish there was someone there to share it with me but I Am and learn\nAbout ... [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] but on the road on for your windows or look at the moon and so to an empty but which is very lonely\nThank you and how typical would you say is that to hold your tongue or the bicycle what do you think learning this feels like\nFeels like it I like a deep I we've been asking ... ... they think the opposite of loneliness and it's you know what would you say\nEverybody has access happiness happiness the offices of learning message happiness\nJak king you're listening to health check from the BBC with me Claudia Hammons today we're discussing the results of all study the b._b._c. lending us experiment and professor of mine ... to one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me\nAnd we'd jak the issue seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see the in the study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on Iran today\nThese cost them blue with relatives ... sometimes\n... and I don't see that button for them and then also bed and for me with my sister so I go and have lunch with them when they're alone\nHere in the southeast usual even more joining festivities that we all these people are you alone yes okay so let's meet and have lunch together food is a big funding for people\nWho are Muslim Antonio mostly in my case I've never felt lonely because I'm young I've always been surrounded by my friend's family I don't even know what it means being lonely I feel like I always lived in a very strong and you know to finally now I think the family is the price of everything\nLydia and have friend Jenny now before we go I wants to talk about what people can do about learning as we all people to tell us the solutions that have helped them cope with it\nA ... to do with stress of storage site into people's I'm always opens up with them regardless of whether on all of them are not um so if a ... or if I Do know you still do the um the food if you will speak to my\nSoul from those really positive and also ...\nI definitely keep myself busy and I\nAppreciate again ... every one but that's just the way the ... things even my my friends say now that I didn't even see for not because you're using because when you were doing stuff and that's the way I couldn't really nice and I I Love being surrounded by people and I love pasta and and that's the way I keep myself busy\nEverybody can do something even if it called for a while like Joel\n... pie do more to come up\nAnd then you look at it and it was it last year with it or destructive but it's interesting that ... to do something that really distracts you like that because\nFifty five thousand people from around the world of told us what they think about loneliness and the number one solution that people suggested will to distract themselves by getting very involved in hope is old tough times all old look and that is actually what you said\nYes that is the author\nSemi weather in the study ... of distracting yourself was the one that came out talk but what else was in the top five\nSo first of all the destruction is a is a really interesting concept because you can also think of it has some simply you know enjoying being by yourself engaging with things by yourself but of course some people will see that as a distraction if they are if they're feeling bad for example\nThe second one was about joining social groups are clubs and of course it won't work for everyone and it won't work if the you've joined the group that is for example not accessible then you have a disability so the group itself needs to be one that is inclusive\nUm the third one was about thinking positively breaking with negative thoughts cycles which is of course a a a really a problem when you are already feeling quite lonely for quite some time so there are techniques a psychological techniques for this to help people get out of those cycles\nBefore is is it was interesting was about starting a conversation with anyone a small moments of social interaction\nCan become big moments of course and I really liked the example of the the person who spoke to who spoke about\nYou know asking people for a cup of tea that's really nice way of preparing to have those those little moments because you do need to know what are you going to say\nBut it's also good example of how ... how cultural this can be and how much it needs to work for you because you know it it it's funny but in in in a British culture of course people want to have tea that's a big thing and\nYet here he writes we must have Boston yeah by where I come from only people who are ill will have teeth opening up and say\nAnd the number five was talked to friends and family about your feeling exactly which is an interesting one because we found that the people who said that they had high levels of London is less likely to suggest that one suggesting it\nIt might be difficult that what what for every one\nOf course it's true and it's it's also true that to to talk about do you use the word loneliness one's saying that might be the most difficult that so it is also about finding ways of talking about it and not necessarily say I'm Alone they\nIt can simply be about you know I really would like to to see people more often or you know can we go for that cup of tea every Sunday instead of doing it so sporadically so it is about finding a way to do it but it is a very important one today\nAnd if you want to hear more about the top solutions in debt and to try to ... which ones might what best for you to download on you ... how you can fail less lonely we put a link to it on the health ... website\nNow my mother I Know there's a lot of data still view to analyze but what is the main takeaway few that comes out of the BBC letting us experiments I saw\nI think one of the things is that uh is is this whole divergence between\nPeople perceiving that there is a stigma and being quite ashamed about feeling lonely but actually the fact that we don't find one we did not find negative views of learning as I Am not I think is an eye opener\nAnd it's something that we can actually stress more to to liberate people from that pressure of there being a potential stigma about it so that's something I Would want to pursue more\nWell thank you so much for joining us today man when I but I Am thankful only the ... to it but she said was pulling ... I'll be back with more from the well to global health and health checks and the BBC at the same time next week\nWhen we'll hear why not a good idea to contact lenses in the shower my name's do the Hammond by now\nOn the next on being lately long shelter searching and tender enough holidays in American Life\nI've often said that I felt like this was a project of constrains\nI Want it as much as possible to avoid this sort of nostalgic torture\nNative life my life I'm ... please join us in\nSunday Morning it was used in public media news eighty eight seven\nAnd good morning to you it's two fifty nine here at your NPR station your National Weather service for cast includes partly cloudy skies low in the mid seventies we may see some scattered showers throughout the day but it will be partly sunny with a high near Ninety\nI'm Stephen K and this is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty\nEight seven ...

Pacific tectonic activity but it is cool Tina complex network of geological folks squeezing and bending it every which way and one of them runs right on how to\nJudges feel ... very well I think produced a comprehensive seismic hazard map of the region only two years ago\n... as a city that sits in the sort of long gated ... valley\nAnd that is a long awaited along a big fault called the ... fault which is the strike slip fault which has considerable relative movement four to six centimeters a year of movement along it and that's quite rapid for fault so it has very high potential to rupture in a large earthquake as it seems to have done\nAn strike slip means that one side to sort of moving north on one side is moving south roughly\nThat's right to the side of moving north and west sides moving so\nSo how much movement walls that and how much if not full broke on friday\nThat's a good question I mean it it varies of course along the fault but let's see the U.S just so we had about six major maxim slip but I also saw satellite analysis to suggested about five or six meters slip extended it all along the fall through pollen itself\nAnd that's one of the important things as I understand it is that although the earthquake started some distance away it spread and Polly itself was moved it was broken by this as quick\nThat's right that seems to be what happened the thing is the fault goes essentially right through Palo at skirts the western edge of the city but it's right there and if you were close to that they will be very violent shaking\nIn a sense I'm getting a picture of ... because of its geological history being incredibly vulnerable to all kinds of consequences of an earthquake like this\nFirst of all is right on the fault is in the narrow valley that's right on the fault this valley filled with very soft sediments in the sediments can amplify the seismic waves and they're also as we've seen recently subject to liquid faction and then it's right next to ... bay in which soon armies can be generated\nAnd when he talked about liquid French and that's basically when the soil tunes liquid and you know they just stopped folding buildings up that's exactly right one of the questions I had the non said ace how long it took full to sue nominee to arrive after the shaking had happened\nYeah no one really knows very well because until now we haven't had any data but I did just see that there was some tied gauge records from policy which suggests less than ten minutes of travel time if the timing needs to be believed that suggest about ten minutes which is extraordinarily short travel time for this nominee\nAnd you can turn that into a distance because I guess you have a decent idea of how false as soon as he weighs move\nYes you can it depends on the ... century so you have to look at the cemetery and sort of trace ... back and I think it would have to be generated in ... bay certainly not up around them Delaware the epicenter was\nAn people when they heard about the nominees recently they've been these subduction full like you have off Japan and off so much when the whole see big changes it shaped Maxwell pushes the walls to call them and that's not the case I proceed with the strike slip this kind of sliding motion\nWell that's right so the subduction zones are what are we call thrust earthquakes for when we're the plates are being pushed together in one sort of pop up and down and that of course pushes water and that's what causes the Saddam\nWhere's this fall to the strike slip fault so it involves side by side motion and it doesn't necessarily push the water up or down you know it does a little bit but it's far less efficient in generating some army than subduction zone earthquakes typically\nHowever in this case that could be two things at play you're one would be\nSubmarine landslides the sides of the ... bay are relatively steep and there could have been slumping or land fighting generated underneath the water along that bay that could be one factor in general and slowly but also there might be complex fault and we've had the fault\nOn the east side of ... bay and that seems to have switched than to the west side so there might be something happening between those two strands of default that led to uplift underneath the bay so it's still hard to say this point which of those costs the nominee\nBut presumably if they ... they can and that kind of thing at the end it's important to do so\nWell I think it's important to do so presumably it's not as easy to sound yes you can map the sea bed and you could look for a landslide scarps\nAll the issues the after effects that you don't really know how fast the landslide was and that's a critical parameter in determining the phenomena generation but it's really fast it will be more effective in generating so now I mean it won't be open and shut case so to speak\nThere's been a lot of comments about this you know the warning system that but what strikes me is that these ten minutes if that's the right time is an incredibly short time for people to read to end this thing and in fact people had buildings collapsing around them\nOnly a few minutes before the soon Amir arrived it strikes me as a really difficult and dangerous situation for people living in that area\nThat's right that's a very very short time and now says the message with a local ... like this and that are generated you know right off shore the shaking is the war and so if you feel very strong shaking and that means\nThe kind of shaking that makes it difficult to stand in that last for tens of seconds you really need to head up hill as soon as you can as soon as safe to do so you should proceed to high ground\nBefore we finish you know this is one full which possibly has released its energy for the meantime bumped pseudo lazy itself seems to be the most polling knee complicated tectonic setting that seems to be ... with the price\nThat is true there are quite a few faults and ... are the ones that cut through the center of the public coral and associated fault but also in the north there is a very active subduction zone and they're also a couple of active crossed off all of their so yeah there are quite a few faults and some of these faults go right near population center\nAnd along with that you also now have this\nReturn which is now erupting to us you know either the consequences of what just happened or just shows us how geologically active that whole area is\nYeah it's really hard to say for sure when ... are triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of events are connected by the stress field in the injured yours for the earthquake will cause the purpose of the stress field and that might have some kind of\nInfluence on the magnetic plumbing system overhaul keynote it's more likely to happen if the walking was already close to a rupture and then it just took either the stress perturbation or this passage of the seismic waves to sort of push it over the edge and trigger that ruptured that's certainly possible but it's really hard to do for sure\n[noise] feel comments from the Australian

antibodies to target the Nobel Committee makes is important point that they seize using evolution in the lab\nYes exactly so you have the target and you produce a whole library these antibodies\nAnd then some of them will bind more tightly to your target you choose them and then you amplify them\nAnd then you go to the next round and choose the tighter of those and so after a few rounds you have an antibody that binds very tightly ... says kind of design an immunity\nI wouldn't say it's design or because you didn't design anything you let the system choose and that in fact the opposite of
