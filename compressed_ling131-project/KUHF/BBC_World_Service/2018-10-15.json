the b._b._c. news\nThe b._b._c. investigation has found evidence of more than one hundred and six chemical weapons attacks in Syria since president Bashar al Assad agreed to destroy his country's stockpile five years ago\nCorroborating information from multiple impartial sources investigation found that President Assad's forces were behind the majority of the strikes designed to flush out rebel fighters from their stronghold\nThe BBC's Rebecca ... coffee says clothing was he's most of all\nSeventy nine of these attacks the chlorine attacks which is very interesting because chlorine isn't a bond chemical it\nWasn't the cat and destroyed as a positive disarmament um that took place following two thousand and team but when it's used as a weapon it is one hundred percent absolutely illegal um and Seventy nine of attacks that we saw that use chlorine\nThe un says the world should be ashamed that millions of people in Yemen are facing what could become the world's worst famine in a hundred years that's the civil war continues even officials are urging the Saudi led coalition to hold and strikes he's like a day is the un coordinated to Yemen\nThere are Eighteen million people in the country who we consider to be food insecure\nHow the Eighteen million there are eight and a half\nWho every single day they wake up they have no idea where their next meal will come\nWe consider these people to the grave risk a famine and starvation if the war continues we could be looking at twelve to Thirteen million innocent civilians who are at risk of dying\nFrom the laugh at the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to meet senior party officials in battling this morning to discuss the heavy losses suffered by the very insist apology in Sunday's state election in there and\nSee if you lost its absolute majority and Mrs Merkel national coalition partners for Social Democrats so their vote tough Jenny Hill reports\nIt was a disastrous night ... combination partners\nThe beneficiaries ... like the far right after the ... the regional parliament for the last time and to revise nice Green Party which they're not just the region second strongest power mismatched couple will want an extensive ... motion\nIssues and and uh they can't be dismissed on the other hand that the endgame is pretty much the same um and I as I look at what we learned ah two weeks ago\nIs that a woman still have to run the gauntlet of credibility she still has to show\nAn appropriate level of of trauma she has to be truthful um she she can't be overly um resentful or angry\nUm and and Dr Blasey Ford was able to do that so most of the commentators even on a Fox TV that leans a to a supporting a President Trump everybody was saying\nThis is a very very grave situations very very serious so it was a testament to her credibility you are\nA civil rights activist and you're also a feminist as well as ... a law professor\nYou've written a lot about in the sexuality and the different themes of oppression on how they work sometimes income so sometimes in different ways and how people need to be aware and react to learn to put it bluntly do you think America found it easier to relate\nTo the issues raised by Dr fooled cool system working woman but may found that to relate to everything that Anita Hill raised where she was a black woman complaining about sexual harassment from a black man\nI absolutely think that\nA race has a lot to do with credibility I think that the the fact that they were a both ... both elite\nUm that she was seen as more credible more reliable\nAnd that's the part of the story that is a reflection about racial differences both and the stereotypes that women carry with them and their ability to be believed at the end of the day it's it's more or less that it just didn't matter\nUm so yeah she might need believed her name Susan Collins who was who cast in many ways the deciding vote said that she believed her she believed that\nThe trauma that happened um she didn't necessarily believe she was remembering correctly that\nIt was judge Kavanaugh who did it and at the end of the day what ever happened to her didn't really matter a in judging a the the qualifications of a judge Kavanaugh\nUm so I I think at the end of the day what we see here is is what I sometimes call you know ... a cemetery she had to do a lot to be credible and even when she did all that\nThe burden basically shifted the hand\nThere was virtually nothing he could do a that would have destroyed his credibility if that performance that we saw in including a loss of temper\nTo Democrats if all of that\nWasn't enough to undermine his credibility one wonders shorter coming in and throwing themselves on the ground and say I did it I did it\nOr whether anything would have allowed a Christine Blasey Ford to prevail so it really is a recognition that there's a huge gap between what men can do and get away with and what women can do to actually being taken seriously\nYeah or I should just articles that brought commoner denies all those allegations and that was a scene throughout the the hearings but but\nHere's the the the basic\nQuestion I have for you because your analysis of the way society works and you'll you'll work on this is what you call into section\nThis programming is brought to you by the reach at school and independent Catholic school were boys through eighth grade work to become scholars and gentlemen welcome Wednesday tourists this fall more apt to reach a score dot org\nAnd when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist shoulder\nIs but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looks as you say the failure at times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black sisters\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist rude it's time to go back into survival mode due to the dumpster fire and live by a black\nFeminist agenda and\nI mean I could just laying people who actually\nUh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are I think differently of course we don't all think alike and so having a quote from someone who\nIs exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same\nTime I know this guy is a problem I I get\nI get the intersect the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common called American make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nFuture in review conference here in ... City Utah gather\nCoins expertise medical environmental people working in national debates you can hear them transferring around me but the connecting do for all this future facing wisdom is\n[noise] no I've been coming to this event for some years now and what I see among many of these experts roving to fake and anxiety even by the way the Internet is heading scandals around data breaches a part of\nThe data harvesting model of which the Internet companies like Facebook and Google build themselves as an added to the [noise] the only one of the disease that leaves a fundamental as soon as a huge question and it's one we're going to be addressing\nToday to these guys a couple of ...\nThe uh showcasing here at the conference with simple street level products to respond to the growing anxiety\nMy name is Denise Hayman low up and I'm the c._e._o. of sorry\nDidn't exist for the Gulf is coming to adaptable private platform for larger companies oh groups meeting to communicate and collaborate in ... it's a safe space from the outside world\nSo for example one of our clients is the ... the association of national advertisers\nAnd the way it works for them is that they're VIP members is just a thousand chief marketing officer at some of the biggest companies in the world using our platform they've created this private experience for all the CEOs and we're talking to see him as a target and Walmart and\nJohnson and Johnson are using this platform to collaborate on actions around the marketing industry\nSo it's a closed secure network you're offering the spoke to each organization\nYes exactly and spoke it being a good word because it's fully branded their organization and and so it's got the features of social networking chat technology for collaboration fundraising advertising an art Pete matching\nThat's interesting because it's a it's a bunch of things as you say but I was going to us could really flat says question which is what's wrong with a Facebook group or a whole lot so critical something equivalent\nWell the easy answer is that a Facebook group first of all can you trust Facebook in our environment in our platform you own your own data which is really key you can control your environment you can control the experience your members have that's a really big deal if there's more secure you think you'll have to prove\nTruth is a strong word I Would never even thought nothing is ... ... if I weren't enough to know that\nBut it is very very secure an encrypted we're actually integrating biometric security from UNICEF into our platform so you can actually have full biometric written a recognition facial recognition voice recognition to get in and we're also implementing block tainted knowledge which will increase the privacy and security of the data\nI'm into I'm just in the companies the private sector people you speak to the clients who come to you do get the feeling that there is a growing demand that we need us opposed for this kind of sharing off of the Web the Web has become such a hostile environment for many companies isn't it\nAbsolutely and that's I think what we're really picking up on when we started five years ago\nI had to explain what community was and now everybody understands community everybody understands that the public social media world has its purpose but it's more about broadcast messaging an advertising and it's not about\nPrivacy and security and it's not branded so like when a company puts their page on Facebook they're giving Facebook the right to use their brand\nAnd that's about it a little bit crazy\nDenise Hayman lower he says she's now getting in France not just for corporations with\nUN agencies desperate for this type of clothes secure network the shipping foot is rather more individually focused his company ... provides an app called ... that basically allows private citizens including him\nTo keep personal details like name email and so in secret when they find themselves interacting with strangers on the line\nI have season tickets to the local basketball franchise\nAnd I never get to go 'cause I'm traveling all the time so I ended up selling them on Craig's list sites those sites want your mobile number they generally want an email address sometimes they want more information\nAnd what happens is once that information is on that site it's there forever\nAnd so I'm getting calls for the concert tickets in town or I'm getting calls for you know it'd be the next local event\nAnd those numbers are impossible block they're impossible to keep out of your general kind of data to use and so what I use my pseudo for is I generate a persona that allows me to sell on Craig's list with a separate set of information separate phone number separate email\nAnd when the seasons over I can just delete that identity there's no connection back to me there's no personal information floating out there\nSo Steve the guy who's regularly setting his tickets 'cause he can never make it to the game you you've got one set of phone numbers and Steve who's actually now called John but you put another email they can email Joan every time to get those tickets he will never another Steve he's buying from he never needs to know\nIt never needs to know and and I we see this a lot with folks especially people who are potentially at risk on line it's one thing for me\nTo sell Jessica does nothing for women to also fall in line and meet strangers that she doesn't know we've all heard about the river stocker or these other kinds of sort of safety risks that folks have on line and I think we've had this kind of a symmetry between the amount of information were compelled to share\nAnd the amount of information we would like to share\nNow we know over time that companies like Facebook and Google and others\nReally didn't need to know all the information because you are the product the more they know about you the more they can sell you and we want to just shift the balance back to sort of more user center control and we think it's unique we haven't seen anything like that\nSteve shutting foot founder of tech start up a ... labs here on business dating from the BBC so there are two business responses to some of the online threats but how bad is it really oh these concerns I have a date to just an occupational hazards of life on line or are they something deep\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat's a very small founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications in information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the ... to the ... Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure has outgrown the original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last uh several\nDecades but still people don't necessarily\nPanic about assault someone else's harvesting that data particularly so getting a free service in return if it's a social platform or something else\nBut they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's been many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person once that her corporation wants her government once but\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as ... has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSort of the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model at Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out his his his now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there is a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you\nRelative to other humans but right now you're in danger if you share your data from a insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them a better bad in their future so\nCorrect I Know that ever since um she passed away and and more attention has been brought you've raised a lot of money\nIs an animal go some day this week called the long Institute in Dallas and get the procedure started I've been told that works and I've been told that doesn't work [noise]\nBut I Do know of I don't at least try it uh [noise] uh probably may make it through the end of the year and that's about it so to me it's [noise]\nYou know it's worth a try I mean I Can't lose\nWhat do you think Cynthia would be telling you to do right now about this\n[noise]\nThe shore or a hundred and ...
