I I Want to play something that I'm John Brennan said today or one of the people who was targeted for one of these pipe bombs and it gets to what you're talking about and also what Charlie has been saying also Joan\nIt's very important for an individual who is\nIn the oval office today to say exactly about so that we need to come together as a country we need to unite you may have differences but this should be no reason whatsoever to resort to these types of facts of intimidation um specially violence I sincerely wish that all from\n... would have said these things previously\nAnd regularly I Wish that he would have encourage people from all different backgrounds and political affiliations to come together\nJoan I ... I wanted to play that because it's sort of sets it it sort of frames nicely what what we've all been talking about here you want it to jump in before I did that\nI did I mean I just wanted to add since we're we're you know we're all little bit behind here and we're talking to each other and trying not to look at TV or anything else\nBut I did get the tweet a and apparently the the president added to his warm you know calm words the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and stop\nEndless hostility and to me that's blaming the victim\nI mean the media did not bring this on CNN did not bring this on itself\nSo that again and he kind of the market back what I had a gay and he's putting a target back on a on ever he is very ... very conscious very consciously it's another both insider ism but it is completely immoral and you know we shouldn't expect any better\nBut we've also got a call it out of that is just outrageous\nSee I Am I'm I'm One of those people who has or I I've watched the president\nAnd I've I've grown accustomed to the rhythm\nThat is President Trump and that is something happens\nHe says the right words and then I click a stopwatch to wait how long it takes\nFor him to defy the scripted words and so even Charlotte you don't have the right thing for a while and so and so here we are and that sort of leads to the question that I was the next question I was going to ask which is what is the ... what is the presses responsibility I was going to ask that Joan before you read that way before you read that sweet\nI'm the president saying it's our responsibility but is it depresses responsibility here\nAre our responsibility to tell the truth\nAnd by and large we do and what he could you know considers and demeaned as fake news\nTends to be accurate news he has gone on a spray of lies in the last week or so I mean we really we I Can't believe it but the old the old Trump was with a little more mellow\nAnd valleys that we have a neutron who is you know Ninety percent more racist and then ... Charlie struggling so I like that\nOr you know he is ready for the midterms and he's bringing in white nationalism and so he keeps escalating and to suggest that perhaps we brought this on ourselves because of our endless hostility is\nAnd to share when I've learned with the next generation of journalists because we need more voice says and\nPassionate young people to join us so we can only do it with our community support for media you make it all possible with your financial support thank you\nWhen Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line of news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWe're asking you tonight what you're telling your kids about our politics have you talked about today's news specifically call us and share your thoughts eat for for seven four or five eight to five five\nUh actually I was going to introduce the next panel our next discussion but I I'm going to go in and take a call and take this call from Sarah in union County Ohio Sarah thank you very much for calling into America on the line\n[noise] thanks for taking my call\nSo what are you where do you are you what are you telling your kids about politics for kids about politics\nYeah show um I have four kids between the ages of ... eleven and Nineteen [noise] and and I also pastor to rural church it attack here in union county and I find myself kind of preaching from the pulpit and to my kids kind of the same thing on a lot of levels is first of all\nWe have to learn to listen to one another better we have to learn to ... not\nVillain I is the other with the problem of a single story because we keep hearing these narrative that this person is this or that person is that\n... and everyone's story is so much deeper than them and so when we go to the death of experience and we've really left in ... in love and deep reflection from one another were able to understand and ... and maybe can act\nIn a way that quite frankly this kind of lost track of we're not able to hear one another and we just\nContinue to become increasingly polarized within families within churches within communities so the importance of listening and waiting before we're speaking sometimes being flooded meeting and quick delivering has never been more important\nBut it does mean a method to court to be able to to to tear within also one thing about about this political tribalism which is I think one of the key things to getting out of this is you have to find people\nWithin ones on political community one's own political tried to speak to their own Web lover works used to have a liberal lecture conservative or conservative lecture a liberal and say you got to do this\nMore of this ... that only to not only doesn't work it actually makes things worse because people dig in their their heels so this has to come for political leadership\nBut finally in fundamentally were self governing country and we we can come out of this but that requires individual people individualize to say we want to to live lives and have a high politics hire a on and better than pills to the better angels rather than the darker impulse you saw\nAmericans and current I Would love your reaction to everything that you just heard but jumping off what Peter just said in terms of the solution can this can that happen Kansas change in tone and in an atmosphere that we're in can that happen\nWith out leadership from the president of the United states\nYes but it can happen without leadership and I just want to come back to something you ask which I think is a very important question which is are we at a tipping point we are\nWe're at a tipping point we don't know which way it's going to tip and we're getting closer and closer and closer to that ledge and you feel it\nEvery single day whether it's the reaction to to show gee whether it's their reactions to Kavanaugh we have a I don't want to blame the Democrats that I Want to call and the Democrats that you basically just say there is a leadership gap from either party\nThe political or the Democrat to somebody to come out and be able to articulate for the nation how to cars\nI'm a non tribal way forward and that's where we stand and and so we are at a tipping point not necessarily a tipping point to that I'd like to say that it could be a tipping point for the better if this kind of leadership and doesn't have the one person it can be a group of people\nBut it but we need it and we're going to get it\nI'm Glad you said that ... it's not it doesn't have to be one person it can be a group of people and I think a lot of times people are always constantly looking for the one to leave them out when quite frankly they and a bunch of people around them could be the collective one to do what I Want to go to Brian here in Manhattan\nUh Brian thank you very much for calling into America on the line [noise]\nA year with regard to the mass media and the reason why people do not trust the mass media\nThere was little wonderful article that want to show your title on America could solar general dot com or his whole a journal dot org I'm and basically what the groceries packages explosive packages left at the figures of a mainstream figures on the left\nOr whoever left those packages are the doorstep so calorie Clinton and George Soros wherever it was it definitely was not somebody on the right way uh it definitely was somebody who loves those packages are calculated to watch the cash for Christian on people on the\nOther way around and when I Am going to ... I'm On I'm going to have to cut you off here um because\nThat is the sort of thing what Brian Justin and I just want to point out that I took Brian's call because he told us that he was going to talk about something else and uh pull the switch or ru but what we just heard there is\nExactly what what we've been talking about this problem of people not listening of of\nCasting blame of being suspicious\nIt only happening on one side and may I just say I mean if we are seeing it all over the right we're seeing it from Rush Limbaugh\nAs well as you know the the four Chan and read it and all the other conspiracy mongers these people who are insisting that somehow the left is attacking itself\nAnd I just think again it is not there is not there are not two sides I mean when you ask me before do we blame Donald Trump as a person to the left I said no we cannot we need more information we we cannot and and we know he didn't do it personally so we can't blame him we can talk about his rhetoric\nSo this idea that there's like some kind of clueless between somebody like our friend Bryan and you know folks on the left I mean sure I'm sure you can find some crazy people on the left saying something inflammatory but it ... this is like really\nAh I don't want to say mainstream on the right but it's mainstream on the far right to say this didn't happen the left it to itself people are are soft sabotaging Donald Trump and this is insanity week\nI mean is it fair to say that it's not not mainstream I mean like the things that we used to be considered so called crazy well extreme and\nFar right are now mainstream I haven't\nChecked my Twitter for a while so I don't know Donald Trump has said that yet but I wouldn't be shocked I'm Sorry a but for now it really is on the far right that people are are blaming the Democrats were doing this and\nSo on but it's terrible and and we've just looked at the clock we've got about a Ninety seconds left Peter I want to get you in and caring real quickly uh last last what Peter real quickly\nYeah look I'm a little girl in a ... couple of whom important because politics isn't for 'em and it's perfect profession but noble profession and it's a way to pass justice and we have to get it wrong\nAnd we can do a book where self governing punk warm come and viruses queen gone on the bodies so we can't give up hope\nA and M. and there was a way to recovery up through the ... the worst predicament long shopping centers are over\n... what happened today was incredibly significant this escalation of fear as Bob Woodward said we're in a period of fear that started at nine eleven is continue to this day and we need to learn how to handle this and we need to buy this challenge now\nDrone walls Peter Winter Karen Greenberg thank you very much for being on America on the line we'll take a break here and when we return we'll turn our attention back to the campaign trail in battleground Arizona\n\nSupport comes from the Houston Symphony performing Tchaikovsky celebrated violin concerto and music from Hitchcock's vertigo featuring violinist carrying going yeah with guest conductor ...

Senate race which isn't particularly competitive also has two female candidates are we're starting to see more and more a woman dressed as women Senate races which are\nExtremely uncommon obviously for 'em much of the twentieth century now\nSo in the in the Republican I'm Obamacare repeal plan that passed the house there were what Republicans claimed work protections for people with preexisting conditions\nOr industry groups advocacy groups Democrats lots of people basically looked at these productions and said these don't go nearly as far as Obamacare does if people lost insurance for a period of time those protections right go away in other cases\nYeah well to get health insurance for that health insurance wouldn't actually cover your pre existing condition which would you know sort of eliminate the point\nSo really there's no one clear plan that's emerged Republicans do clearly wants to make the case that you can have these pre existing conditions productions without having Obamacare that's a line that you'll hear a lot\nUm Missouri senator or excuse me Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley who is one of the attorney generals who is suing the federal government over Obamacare and his running against McCaskill in Missouri\nHas said this quite a bit you don't need to have Obamacare to have the preexisting production could conditions but there is no consensus Republican plan on this holiday has floated a few ideas that different people have said fall short in different ways\nUh but that conservatives have supported inside yeah this this will get the job done it really there is no consensus Republican plan there's been no attempt to develop one in either the Senate or the house or in any real way so really the answer is that they don't necessarily have an answer but they do want to be able to say\nLook we can protect preexisting conditions without Obamacare without necessarily saying how that would actually get on\nWhile okay we've got time for one more call and that is from Meg in St Louis max thank you for calling into America on the line\nThanks you for taking my call so health care is an issue for you in this election [noise]\nAh yeah I didn't streamline type ... diabetic and uh I live in Missouri and\nYeah Charlie's kind of a terrifying for me I'm more of the reasons I moved back from Virginia Beach because I couldn't get health care not true and player in the state of Virginia with very high to high risk pool that was put in\nSeveral years ago so even though it is now five hundred bucks a month at premium I could actually get coverage um and\nYeah yeah I mean pretty much encouraged by Medicare came in every child I touch you know when I retire all that was determined by the health care that they\nProvide 'em and the amount of coverage that gets ... and I don't I don't want to go back to that [laughter]\nI I I hear your bag and you are not alone in in that sentiment make thank you very much for calling in to America on the line\nI and that sort of brings into high relief Kevin what you were talking about it when I asked the question what are the plans that Republicans have for the replace part ... um if they're successful in in\nGetting rid of a overturning repealing the Affordable CARE Act and from ... from what you said that there are a lot of there are a lot of ideas but no consensus\nYeah there there is no consensus I mean the Republican plans to replace Obamacare have always been focused on lowering costs they haven't necessarily been ads focused on protecting access\nAnd those sort of two goals have always been in conflict throughout healthcare policy how do we ensure access and cover everyone including the very sick including the very poor\nWith out also driving up costs for everyone else and that sort of the the problem no one's been able to fix 'em Obamacare had a few provisions that were designed to curb cost\nSome of those version seemed to be working some of them don't seem to have been working as well and that's really the central tension here and Republicans overtime clearly have emphasize more on lowering overall health care costs\nBut yet that might mean that they're

come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist an anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentions that cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics so particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nOur self as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last ... came out last year some fans to key issue with the casting choices you see never before I had to stall will steal had so many women in ethnically diverse ... think prominent roles and fish and got some fancy evening\nIs an agreed definition of foreign aid and also which countries launches give the capital and foreign aid to the best way to measure how generous country aides\n[noise] good question time plenty to talk about before we take a look at the numbers let's deal with the definition of foreign aid\nThe organization for economic cooperation and development the or we CD created a strict definition of age in the Nineteen sixties they call it a da ... official development assistance\nDon't surprise pox is executive director of a day to a research lab of William and Mary University in Virginia in the United states\nHe explains what three conditions needs to be met for aid to classify as a da\nTo be a grant or below market rate loan from a government agency in the during our country the second condition is that it must be focused\nOn the promotion of economic development and welfare in the recipient country and the third condition is that the recipient must be a developing country so military age or any other type of aid that's focused on advancing\nThe donors own national security interests that does not qualify as oh da ... from one developed country to another developed country\nYou know say Germany bailing out in Greece that would not qualify as oh da\n... him all from ... to ... lights were in the program now that we've got the foreign aid definition out the way let's take a closer look at the numbers more or less reports at least a male has been busy looking excel spreadsheets\nLizzie let's stop by examining Donald Trump's claim that the U.S is the world's largest give it in the world by fall a foreign aid\nWell if we look at the fish labor costs numbers then yes he's absolutely right\nThose numbers and made available by the CDs development assistance committee that's an international farm twenty nine countries including many of the largest provide if not the u._s. UK Gemini Japan and front\nI took a look at the numbers the teeth out and Seventeen and the U.S provided more than than she five billion dollars in aid Gemini but second with twenty five million dollars and the u._k. was said was Eighteen billion dollars\nOr not might not come as a big surprise given those countries have some of the world's largest economies\nAgreed and there aren't any surprises when you look at the countries at the Boston with less Eva Iceland Slovenia and says I Can't make up the boats industry in terms of types of amounts given by the ACT Memphis and none of them the check in the ... largest economies\nNow our listeners Lydia officers what the foreign aid per capita was a better way to measure how much of the country is\nRight they lay you divide the total amount today to country kids by its population\nAnd when I did that picture changed completely the United states gets roughly a hundred and eight dollars ... past and\nWhich places then seventeenth on the left up to twenty nine countries have three days before the Scandinavian countries particularly well new way leads the way with seven hundred and eighty dollars per person and Sweden Denmark a fit and ... five hundred and fifty dollars and four hundred dollars for that to me\nWhy all of a Scandinavian countries contributing so much\nWell let me take you back to Nineteen Seventy\nWhen the United nations tickets suggestion from a commission they look to the future development assistance ... countries get no point seven percent of that gross national income to fix your development assistance by Nineteen eighty ... and they test and two thousand Seventeen only five of the twenty nine obesity countries met\nThat no point some sent target\nThey was Sweden Noxon that newly them up and the United kingdom the average across all the countries with no point three accent\nAnd the United states because right twenty second giving no point one eight percent of gross national income\nNow if the United states wanted to get no point some sent it would need to find an additional ... billion dollars on top of the thirty five billion dollars it already gives\n... so that's the day so when we look at twenty nine countries that report aid spending to the er we CD but what about the ones that don't some more secretive than others warm in particular has brought pox again\nChina is a particularly opaque donor and lender it has opted out of international recording systems such as the city's creditor reporting system and the international aid transparency initiative in fact Beijing considers the details of its overseas development program to be a state secret\n... didn't put pride on his team also\nDeveloped an open source method of data collection that provides very detailed financial operational and location all information about Chinese government financed\nProjects all around the globe coming from four different places from English Chinese on local language news reports from documents that Chinese ministries embassies\nAnd economic and commercial counselors offices put it in the public domain from the aid and debt information management systems of China's counterpart countries so think of the finance and planning ministries that are on the receiving end these\nMaking money and then finally there's a large body of cheap studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we developed this very in depth methodology to synthesize all this information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government financed projects than a hundred and thirty eight countries around the world\nSo to the numbers show in terms of trying to spending it pays off the old the world's second largest economy\nOne of the major findings that emerges as the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government does not qualify as foreign aid and the strict sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding does not qualify as oh da and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data two thousand two thousand fourteen\nChina spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison to us provided at least twenty five billion dollars of OJ each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a foreign aid the U.S outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the o da is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for the U.S to be outspending China on a ... D a by five hundred percent suggests a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China and the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen\nThe U.S government spends roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you brought in the aperture and use that broader definition of aid China's spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion dollars a year\nTrying to get the loss of aid money to Africa and spends particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications\nBecause most of these projects a commercial they don't count tools or da\n... turned his apricot pits a number it's around four dollars per person for OJ Seventeen dollars per person when all of a money stuck to remember that the equivalent us number is a hundred and eight dollars per person\nBrought pox pointed out to me that ... vote China is a global economic superpower it still has a huge number of people living in poverty\nSo politically giving overseas aid is difficult on mice explain why the Chinese government is so uptight about what to [noise]\nBeen costs reporting [noise]\nAnd now ... asks why women increasingly turning to wellness\nTo rebuild them down as\nSoon as things sound [noise]\n\nIt's a friday evening and I'm On the top deck of a full ... the ... into a restaurant and you're off a busy road and there is found sirens going off and the people who during chips down stats thoughts on ... in ...

inspiring but women uh taking things into their own hands instead of giving up a bean seeking the healing they need and yet this can leave women vulnerable to practices which may not necessarily help

prices served to the first stage\nIs we also developed a the world's first fertilizer producing urine all and end this year and all we produce a solid fertilizer and then what we do is we remove the liquid component and we used to make it\nSo that's why I always call it a stage prices so the first stage is we make ... and then the second stage is we make the brick and the third stage is we make another fertilizer so to answer your question how did we collect the urine will we installed our ... year in those\nIn the engineering building at the University of Cape Town\nAnd we had some mail during those donate their precious urine\nAnd from that and we made the brick\nNow I've I've seen the Brits obscene brick kilns and reporting stories about ... about how it's made in the damaging

essentially make and what they do not actually face in ... in the sand particles together so when you\nWhen they are they going to be a solid damning as as a as a break 'cause a a a normal break\nSo so just to give you an idea when we first started this crisis last year we the very first run that we had we achieve the same ... as a forty percent limestone brick and then just a few months later we've doubled that strength now just by\nEssentially changing the material that we put into the mold and then allowing the bacteria to a point we point goats for longer with zero heat\nWith Sarah heat so oil at room temperature so that any ... any energy way require is the pumping\nMarketable there many people find that hard to believe\n[laughter] we have the results\nHave you I think yeah you're on the news or any other any buildings that you made with the Brits yeah\nAh no no no no it's still very early but um I have to say that we went the first people to come up with the idea of making bricks using\nYour ... that's actually what we take from the urine is we off to the area so there's a a company in the U.S called by a Mason and they use\nSome of the day I but they use them tick tick urea\nAnd if you know anything about what comes from it's really not a sustainable protests are essentially what they do they take the nitrogen from the air they use a lot of energy and then they converted into your ear\nAnd when we started this project we we well I knew that for example year and have a lot of ... that's the predominant component in it so I wanted to know whether we could be exactly the same thing but use the euro ... states are offering much more sustainable approaches\nAnd the short answer is yes we can some now we have to see how we take this for\nSo many questions on his mind this is just said does it does this thing Dillon\nI guess it does but the way as well\nThe price for the British as well\nSo so let me just clarify so the initial process or what it does is as a byproduct purchases ammonia\nAnd it's the ... that you're going to smell us or if you've ever had the opportunity I guess it's safe for example you had a pet like maybe a cat and the peas in a

because he essentially at some nitrogen rich source of of potential for life so that's the third part of the price of federal was talking about\nSo that's the next day it used to see if we can convert that into another fertilizer and\nHealth risks in this done\nSo I get so we had to apply for complete ethics approval I can imagine the university so that was going to\nSay so darned ever coming

someone just based on where they are you have to judge them based on where they're going and and considering the culture\nAnd values of Saudi and where that country's been I think a lot of the reforms that Mohammad bin selmont has implemented had been very positive and so in terms of the art of its progress\nUp until recently we've we've like where it's been going\nSo what are you going to do now [noise]\nWell now I'm going to hope\nThat they re committed to the vision twenty thirty towards modernization towards the liberalization and if we see\nReal positive signs that they are doing that and that they're taking seriously human rights that they're taking seriously sustainability that they're taking seriously the rights of journalists than a woman a venerable will potentially re engage but until then we're going to be standing on the sidelines\nRight I mean what would that take ... what it literally take a major gesture such as the release of various human rights campaign ISIL something specific\nLike that or those would be good first steps I mean I think we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality on the ground in Saudi Arabia would have a long way to go in terms of ... the cultural norms we have a long way to go in terms of moving the country away from fossil fuels and of course there are a lot of people who are wrongfully imprisoned right now and I think all of those things put together what would paint a very good picture\nIn recent weeks on this program we've been talking about the full thing of businesses to take a stand on gun control for example the position of Nike that it took on the black lives matter movement and the Colin Kaepernick a campaign\nIt seems as though more and more companies are being forced to take a stand on political issues where they didn't in the past\nAnd I think this is fantastic uh since the Nineteen seventies business has been dominated by this idea called the Friedman doctrine put forward by Nobel Prize winning economists Milton Friedman and the essential idea of it is that the purpose of business any sole purpose of business should be maximizing shareholder value and nothing else and what we're seeing is that in that\nWay of thinking about business had has led to a huge number of problems when businesses chase proper at the expense of the welfare of their employees at the expense of the society around them at the expense of the environment the expense of human rights of bad things happen and so we think that there's a real generational shift underfoot that's very good for the world\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists sets ban and so what do we know about the embryonic Saturday reform process he refers to the\nWell not all that much in concrete terms we have had some relatively symbolic changes already best known among them legalizing Saturday women's rights to drive in June this year\nBut what else do we have critics points to ongoing reports of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi led coalition ... rebel who T areas in neighboring Yemen actions that are thought to cost tens of thousands of civilian casualties\nOn the economic side the crown prince has proposed the building of new eco friendly mega cities in the desert aiming to diversify the country away from its oil focus he's created a huge so bring wealth and valued at some sixty billion dollars now\nEnergy expert Ellen a wolf is also of a book Saudi Inc she says much of this cash has so far been focused on foreign vestments not in the country itself\nAre really interested in making vestments in companies and yeah I mean Russia ... Africa is also being talked about the focus on\nMaking investments for fun team localized insanity my dad he means to be seen whether they're going to be alive to contribute to their family\nEconomy and just have employment in any real or effective way\nIn which case how seriously can we take this reform process in terms of the country's domestic arrangements have there been any clues at the conference itself this week\nThe app senses are without a doubt noticeable and prominent\nBut the question is very whether Matt rovers health and fitness team it's gone from the region and that's not something that we're seeing more stuff than\nLower level executives attending the conference I say you know they want to be in Saudi backed the image if cell important and that's why the executives are not present\nExactly we Japan's softbank I think was one delegation where they went to Saudi Arabia they shouldn't go to the main conference so I said from another Australian outfit that's done something similar\nAnd much more prominent if Russia and Asia and the majority of the featured deals with Asian companies they're mostly in the oil and gas and transportation factor for of technology conference in those areas involve a lot of technology\nBut it's not the kind of technology focus companies that we saw featured prominently last year\nOne thing that's surprising to me is the reports that the conference is still packed out I mean despite all e absentees and there are many of them that they still manage to kind of it's standing room only isn't it by the sounds of it\nIn certain ... that that hurt them standing room only their stuff and they have the presence of Gulf area individuals\nSo essentially if the Americans or Europeans with staying away it's pretty easy to find others to step into that that place\nIs definitely a recognition that there's a lot of money that the government is still interested in putting into their not stopping this diversification plan they're stuck on solid with it it's still a desire for foreign businesses to come in and participate in the frontline shouting economy\nI Believe my I have been some and in his speech to the conference this week praise for example the head of the French oil group to tell for being one of those who agreed still to attend despite the controversy\nThat he suggested that loyalty by foreign trading partners like this would be rewarded there is a clear push back against the boycott from others\nThat's typical of flight Saudi tradition this idea of ... but at the same time ... ventures in setting the have largely been with around ...\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand eighty\nThese mounds and we're right on top now these mounts have whether whether it a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains wouldn't be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them\nAnd with that of course they take part of them now and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf this now and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis strategically placed over here to our east we have a lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the southeast all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at least Jackson\nThey were finding copper breast plates or ... ... we don't have ... in Florida so it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a thug burial\nWhy is it so important this again the thousand to Fifteen hundred in a community that lived here before the soda came through what what's it what does it mean to you\nI just cannot imagine the level of complexity an organization required you know we always think of prehistoric people as\nPrimitive but they were complex they lived amongst nature and they were able to take that and work with it to build these massive structures and I think it's a testament to their abilities as a culture and as a society

responded to President Trump this morning by saying he should look in the mirror I Do you hold the way in which President Trump\nHas can duct tape public schools responsible to a certain extent for what's taking place\nAre absolutely the president has broken all kinds of norms and taboos on how our public figures or speak in um in public speak to the nation or his style has been uniquely divisive\nLast night when he was speaking at a political rally that many thought he should have canceled after the bomb plot became a uncovered a you know he became she she did call for unity but it

crowd of Trump supporters begin chanting lock her up he did nothing to stop it and then to attack or the media as he did this morning is completely in character you know she has vilified all the

violent way and um you know just to underscore how divided we are the\nPundits who support a Trump have been out there choosing a suggesting that this is a plot by the left to embarrass the president
