I'm Out of office and so I'm kind of I'm away from DC I'm In San Antonio or a lot when I'm not traveling\nA and I'm going to make a decision about my own future after November\nWhat are you looking for what are the to the indicators that show you that the Americans ready for holding on cash for presidents were run\nWell I mean I've I've taken the last few months to go and help people that are on the twenty Eighteen ballot because you know that's the priorities will ensure that folks when twenty Eighteen um but as I've done that I've gotten a sense of where the country is that what they're thinking and I'll continue to do that between now and November six [noise]\nAh I see very clearly that people want a new generation of leadership\nThey're interested in people from outside Washington folks that are new faces that are going to bring a fresh perspective\nLeadership uh and you know whether I jumped into the race or not a hundred in that Democrats are going to have great choices in twenty twenty\nWhen you were serving as the HUD secretary and a new bomb administration you were quoted as saying that you considered to be the department of opportunity or what did you mean by that and do you think it still is\nI called the department of opportunity because so much of what it does makes it possible for people to\nTo achieve what they want to achieve the nobody can go anywhere in life without a stable place to live in for a lot of people who are low income or even middle class it's become very difficult to afford the rent much less to buy a house [noise]\nSo what we were doing it hard was making\nIt possible for folks to have a steady foundation is alive\nAnd therefore making opportunity possible I don't agree with the direction that the Trump Administration has taken holiday and I don't think they believe in the mission they wanted to cut the budget by six billion and the only reason they did in his because Congress didn't let them so what you have\nAre a lot of state governments local governments that are having to pick up the slack you have a little over seven thousand employees at HUD career employees that I think are the more allies\nThey don't think the political leadership believes in the mission of the organization and so the sooner that we can get past this phase of leadership to better\nLewis has written a book or the fifth risk writing about hand off on these cabinet departments\nIt came up with a great selection and I say in the book that Tim Kaine was I think are a good selection\nOr he had been a governor who's a senator he's from Virginia which was an important state to carry and and the Clinton came ticket did carry it yeah I just saw that is that made sense both\nAt the moment and also because he was a great\nCandidate but the Latino vote didn't really turn out for Hillary Clinton and a twenty sixteen\nSome say had you been on the ticket that you would have brought some electricity to that campaign or maybe even a reality check into a campaign that seemed to be a on a worm what was going on in America\nWhile who knows you know you can never tell I think that I Do think that ah there's a great young bench I'm among Democrats and and that you're going to see a lot of that twenty twenty and one of the things that happened I think a\nPost twenty six team is that it's now possible for the younger generation of Democrats to\nArticulate their\nVision and perhaps for some of them to run for president in their own light and I see this is a great thing\nWhat do you think went wrong with twenty sixteen for the Hillary Clinton campaign\nYou got to start from the fact that she won two point eight million more votes than Donald Trump and that it was always going to be tough to keep\nThe presidency because hardly ever does a does the same party habits for three terms still of course there are things that could have been done better in the campaign I think anybody would acknowledge that [noise]\nKnow there probably should have been more attention paid to the numbers in Michigan\nIn Wisconsin or in Pennsylvania and there's a lot of lessons learned you know one lesson is that yeah we got a campaign everywhere with everybody and that we got to run through the finish line in twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty\nWould kind of healing do you think America is going to need in a twenty twenty with whoever becomes president if it's not going to be Donald Trump\nCommercial banks soared coming\nWhat should've been a moment of triumph with economists preventing the crisis turned into a spectacular public failure but we're calling them is to blame for not stopping the crisis here's the highly regarded lead economics commentator the Financial Times must move\nI Do think that economics town folded and asked it influenced policymaking bad substantial responsibility for what went wrong\nSo what we're calling them is meant to be doing economists people like me will come all kinds of things economist in finance advice bankers and their clients how to make money and understand risks\nThose working for government in central banks in finance ministries have a particular responsibility to ensure the financial stability\nThe Nineteen nineties and only two thousands were good times were calling him for\nThings running smoothly they were rewarded with money and kudos most of the public would barely aware of them as economies apparently kicked along nicely on they watch until suddenly these experts proved to be totally incompetent and able to see the crisis coming and to stoppage\nProfessor Nixon presidents of the u._k. Israel economic society thinks the reason that economists dropped the ball was that there's some things with load\nIf not easy to have a really slick pat I'm sets up like they didn't see it coming but one way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they would sound all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know about financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into woven way\nSo they build models not one dumbing down notes down enough of them now they build models actually what I noticed that wasn't bad [noise]\nWatch all these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates unemployment [noise]\n\nOriginally there were actual mechanical model is still one on display New Zealand that uses water to demonstrate how money would float around the economy as computing power has grown\nSo to as the complexity of the models which should call them is try to capture\nThe key relationships in a set of clever equations [noise]\nWhat professor Nick stone is saying that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed it would bounce back and most affect others but why would preventing models assume that the crush couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occur with disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous list because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation and what that meant was the boom and bust didn't seem to be with us suddenly this Otis Redding along in a chair for way down the river a reasonable state and things were going OK\nPoliticians believe this to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue ... big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven\n[noise] we will not return to the old boom and bust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist or someone is what my whole life\nIn economics truth be told\nHow ... model\nOf how the economy function of how our system and um that will cost models fail at the first offense in the crisis they could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSo of course that was the fattening we can and we should have happened after the Nineteen thirties\nReform route and branch seems crazy now\nTo think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money in banking and explaining the big ... and the economy\n[noise]\nIt wasn't the economists who are false will the discipline of economics itself [noise]\nMy own view is that it's not economics but the economists have come to dominate the discipline\nThat having a helpful obsession with perfect markets ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly\nThese high priest of the new economics simply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage will collusion which one forensic to market economies [noise]\n\n... the former chief economist is one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new factions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody showed got me seeing a crisis coming not doing that I I go to a particularly bad about not seeing it coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either that my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right match\nOnce that disease has been diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had ... nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to guess far too long to diagnose a disease and responses appropriately that was the school of economics that actually did that is how it out of the crisis as old fashioned ... economics\nAnd a number of people made that point event ethical recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using frontier economics with a guy that got stolen graduate schools they were using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so did he can under the searches\nThat wrote it better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis I like to the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen the common was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class when there was seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense straggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very ...\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on we not learning the same classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was\nAnd then to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession had become windy colon is also widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must not subjects that we usually importance in terms of understanding the crash things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this that was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has not changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true and not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember\nThese are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the court charity\nBut will it different curriculum being\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cools the to bankers and politicians found it convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier to comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nWe need a much more diverse group of researchers in economics and teaches and mental is\nMore diversity and will shift the balance of the topics that are chosen for research it will give us much more talent to make it very plain and I think there's every reason to think that the subject will become even more vibrant even more\nPromising as a way of protecting the really big problems that we face\n\nSince the financial crisis but it's been a healthy soul searching in economics a growing number of people in organizations have been pointing out the obvious flaws and developing alternative views to better understand and improve the way the economy's work\nHas to actually have an impact with matches\nCountry must so says there's some evidence that it's not just lip service that change really is taking place\nWe had the global successive somebody like 'til I ... with his inequality critique\nWe've had you know governments looking into different ways of measuring GDP we've had the big institution that's probably the biggest change like the IMF and the other day if you look at what they used to say before the crash in what they say now it's it's very very different take the\nDate that recommendation so recipes for how to create more jobs in the economy and they\nAnd the nineteenth save us older pirates deregulating and there was that there in Texas and it was that Senate making the labor market more flexible and and I sat and why and now we feed them now it's the talk about the importance of\nUnion and the importance of having relatively high wages than it is it really has changed I definitely think that it comes to Clinton said the crisis end of the discussions that we've had in the last ten yes\nHaving worked at the obesity the organization for economic cooperation and development I can vouch for this progress which is also reflected in the IMF work on inequality and it's and the bank of England work on climate change\nI've seen firsthand how much economics has changed since two thousand and Age New perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes come come about\nThe good news is that there's been some progress the bad news is that this was not it filtered through what he's done in the financial sector impacted on policy makers\nI Believe that the best way to make sure those in power go hold their ideas about economics is for us all to get involved\nThere's a saying economics is too important to be left to the economists if we're all more confident that economic says the metro about daily bread rather than something belonging to men in suits we will be better able to smell Iraq when something's too good to be true such as being offered a mortgage when we can't afford to pay its\nBut many people think of economics it's very complex and the role of the remote subject how can we overcome that and encourage people to get stuck in to improve our economic literacy\nJust like the statistics with politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn it means we can better understand the world around us and we'll be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call and says citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide a much broader basis of understanding so that when something new tends up like the threat of trade was\nThen the kind of resonance the idea that somehow that they had been trade was before that they hadn't had serious economic consequences in the Nineteen thirties that can have a resonance with people with a broader public [noise]\nMy hope is a great economic literacy will make our government's more accountable for the economic decisions they take which impact on our lives\nImproving economics will only make a difference if those in power take notice of rule it's not as if nobody saw the two thousand have crushed coming\nMany economists among economists should the housing boom in the U.S was unsustainable\nThe politicians were not prepared to trick the bubble [noise]\nIn the u._k. economics professionals virtually unanimous in saying that breaks it would be bad for the British economy but that do not stop the majority of votes to supporting it [noise]\nMore recently President Trump has ignored a growing chorus of economists saying that the trade war would cause great harm to the U.S and the world economy [noise]\nIt's easy

I think that ...\nThe Italian government says it's going to pay for all this with higher growth but growers in the economy and easily have been pits distantly week and that's the problem\nExactly growth has been slow and has been lower in the last I Would say Fifteen to Twenty years\nThese government to claim said that this new budget or that the uh contains a lot of additional spending will be financed by higher growth and this is likely\nIn fact the bank of easily says the main thing that the uh the growing age that there was already ... is so or as slowing down even farther\nAnd on top of that the economic uh toward the comic environment is definitely not positive and this means that the the outlook for the economy is negative so I Would say that that is likely that the doctor said the or will be a larger or if the government among the and the promises made\nIt's going to analyze land allocation dangerous how farmers can be assistance to improve productivity an economic development or in the background of course the long running issue of a land allocation land seizure\nAnd uh the uh dreadfully slow I'm a a agricultural agricultural production in what usually referred to as the bread basket of Africa Alex my guy at the University of Kent in the u._k. was advisor to former PM trying to write a and also the constitution writing team as well enjoy just not with his take on this\nUm how important is this actually practically to serve and it sounds like a ... doesn't it the kind of knowing what you've actually got that does the government not know what it's called ... is this\nWhat was the government should know the government is the one was located lent people um do you remember the chaotic Carolyn reform program\nIt was one of them is to that was necessary to be done but unfortunately that too many people at the top of government who are holding on to too much land they know each other I think what's important is to act and not to mid west time at talking about who owns more land and just to say\nYou know ... located in him into the most productive from us\nRight now it's important to act I mean they would say that we're doing this before acting but you say they should just do something now and they can do it without the ... so what should they do\n[noise] you know what they're shooting and these are in twenty section because there's some bubbling land commission we rode in the constitution and each has been there for the five years and they've done nothing about it\nIs a good thing that they're trying to do something up ... now but like I said I think it's important for them to be honest they know each other right to the top of the food chain they know who is holding on to all my shirt and they all have multiple phones and they don't need to give them up\nUm what about I mean the symbolism of this because\nAs far as international aid donors and so on are concerned I\nThis is always be an issue a sort of saw issues and Bob Wei says it has the right to do what it wants with its lands as being the problem of white farmers and so on I mean at what is the political usefulness of announcing this old it now for the government it's a bit of a signal abroad isn't it\nOf course the keys I mean one of the things that you should understand that since November last year when the coup happened at your movements to gather\nMr ... has been trying to hold the international community has been trying to demonstrate that he's a former that he is someone who wants to open up to the world and to do the right things and there is plenty for each mission the election failed to do that's a fairly because each and tend to be a fuss\nAnd editors mumbling commission is packed all of this process of trying to demonstrate to the world that you ... getting ready to form and to do better whether or not it's actually happens I think it's a question to see that there is\nBut from what you say older no that would do if it was a clear and transparent is that they would they would announce to the world that is the elites that owns the productive land\nOr ...

see it going on right now is the people from\nThis town Mexicans have come out to give a these migrants war to\nGive them food we saw them getting medical treatment or even the day by volunteer medics and I can see somebody with a bag of clothes hanging up clothes and that has been going on for the last few hours so\nThey have to be the reaction of people as being very different to the reaction of the Mexican authorities\nWill in a sense the authorities certainly certainly kept the the border game show but what we saw today and I walked with immigrants for most of the day is yes that was a huge security presence of Mexican security presence at one point we saw them form\nA line of riot police in white in the middle of the roots of these migrants were taking\nAnd then suddenly they were they were cool to go back to stand down and go back to their buses and allow these people through the end it was the police who are handing out water now they have encouraged most of these migrants to seek asylum here in Mexico but these people know hey that they've come\nThis fall on that final goal really is to get to the United states be applying for asylum here in Mexico could mean detention for up to forty five days so they're resisting that and they want to continue on to the to achieve that dream which is to get to the United states\nPresident Trump has been extremely clear on a number of

going to comply with European rules\nOf the original plan it put food was considered unaffordable and now the European Commission has demanded to see a new budget by mid day or else uh they've why doesn't Brussels like Italy spending plans\nCouple of reasons the number one reason is equally wants to spend money it doesn't have the second reason is that would break the rules in the eurozone and about how much debt you're allowed to have so you might remember earlier in the year is really had an election\nA couple of new parties formed a coalition in both parties made a lot of spending promises to get elected now they're in power and trying to own others promises but to pay for all that they have to raise the amount of money the government but rice and compared to the previous plan that the previous guests\nAnd had the government barring a that amount is a lot bigger and that's why process isn't very impressed\nAnd the problem is how enormous the national debt already is uniquely break some rules does it\nYes and he said no country should have debt that's with more than sixty percent of its GDP or its annual national income unfortunately Italy has more than twice that amount if ... has a debt to GDP ratio of a hundred and ... percent or two point six trillion dollars\nNow the Italian government says it will increase gross that means uh when it comes to borrowing

down even farther\nAnd on top of that the economic uh toward the comic environment is definitely not positive and this means that the the outlook for the economy is negative so I Would say that that is likely that the doctor said that uh would be a larger a he said the government among the and the promises has made\nWhat do you expect to happen today than at midday who's got it back down here in Brussels\nI think nobody's going to back down and I think the government will stick with the with the budget so we didn't plan\nAnd we'll try to find a clash with the European institution is a populist government to that uh uh he's hiding or the next to European elections in the spring\nAnd there is a finding domestic popular support the by showing that you can uh a fight against the
