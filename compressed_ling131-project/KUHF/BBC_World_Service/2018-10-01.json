V. eight point six used to the surface of the University of Houston thanks for listening and enjoy your eat [noise]\nFrom Texas Public radio this is Texas matters a weekly radio news magazine that looks at the issues events and people in the Lone Star state today on Texas matters San Antonio edits tries centennial\nWith global and local forces to find in shape the city at as founding and still today this is Texas matters from Texas Public radio I'm David Martin Davies\nThree hundred years ago San Antonio was a military outpost beyond what was known it was put in a place called the new world a place that was far away unexplored an uncertain it was founded in settled to prove to the old world\nBut this land belonged to Spain and over the next three centuries the city would change hands and flags multiple times with the fate of taxes hanging in the balance\nToday San Antonio is the seventh largest city in the nation and one of the fastest growing cities in America and it continues fighting some of the same old battles over water political power poverty and race term Miller writes about it in his new book San Antonio ... history\nSan Antonio distance though it was with also a place of great conflict um horrendous conflict actually up through the the nineteenth century\nUm and so it was once the frontier space and that was problematic unto itself but also a place over which despite the fact that it was off the map uh people fought over in pitched battles in various ways and the Alamo is just one of many of those um [noise]\nUh battles in conflicts um and I think\nYou know it may have been on another zone but it turns out that human beings we're really interested in that zone and I would at a third or maybe fourth character to the story which was the way on itself\nThe land as a as an actor in the way in which human beings dealt with it the water flows that were central to survival there from the ... forward in time\nUm and managing those resources or controlling them was also part of why people were fighting over this tiny little town a far far removed from the Spanish Empire and I'm right in the path of the pond Apache and the command she and others\nBut as you talked about San Antonio being eight out posed\nFor the Spaniards as they want it to preserve the map you know they had to prove to the pope in in Europe that they were definitely uh doing something with this land and they could claim it as their own and so originally senator when he was a military outpost\nA San Antonio causes self military city USAID has trademarks that expression many people when we talk about hey San Antonio military city usa they think about\nThe the military as it is today but actually it goes to the very beginnings the\nBeginnings and and it you know it's beautifully demonstrated in the first moment when the first and throw out of the first um expedition shows up in in the city in which they're wrestling with arms and they're seeing this is a place not only to pacify the people who were here\nThat actually has a geographical reason for being does in a watershed that was absolutely crucial for the Spanish to build their missions and ultimately um to fashion a life in South Texas Houston is a it's called the bayou city for a recent\nLike New Orleans it's and it really precarious invulnerable spot and yet it has become the nation's fourth largest city\nDallas has no reason for being and I'm Sorry for folks in Dallas but it's true um but was made to be a city and San Antonio because of its environment and its provision ing hub\nUh posture in effect that it was it supplied goods and services for the surrounding land ranch lands for example in agriculture\nUm could limp along in a way through the nineteenth century without really doing very much in part because the U.S military was there because of its geopolitical importance and that's why the military for more than a century and a half\nWas vitally important in defining what San Antonio was but that meant that the elite in San Antonio the power elite the commercial elite those who were making money off of the military and agriculture\nFrankly they don't have to think large they don't have to imagine stuff because it's there for them were in Houston Dallas they had to be a hell of a lot more creative and so those cities got railroads before San Antonio\nOne sign of whether your entrepreneurial elite is willing to invest in the city's future was the fact that said Antonio every time a railroad possibly would come in before we got one and Eighteen Seventy seven\nI'm kind of split down the middle they weren't convinced it was a good idea for many of them um and you know that was not the case in Houston they had railroads before the civil war broke out that's not the case for Dallas um and so some of this is\nNature gave and we took some of this was the military provided and so we didn't have to think\nUm and some of it is as you said earlier kind of missed opportunities\nUm and not great public policy so you know it's not until after World War two that that in my reading of the city's history that that\nAgain driven by military interests and the extraordinary amount of money poured into San Antonio during World War two billions of dollars World War two ... uh Korea and Vietnam really poured in billions of dollars into the city\nThat enabled the city to not only create the middle class is just a specifically Latino middle class um but also to begin to imagine\nAnd this is crucial that you could really build this thing called the river walk and you could get tourists to come\nBecause it was a beautiful place and you could sell it that way um but it took awhile for that to unfold\nThis is Texas matters I was speaking with charm Miller author of San Antonio a try centennial history of the river walk was\nIn an investment in San Antonio it's crazy idea happen to work at the very initiation of the idea of plenty of people called it folly\nHemisphere sixty eight another crazy idea to just happen to work a lot of people also are like going this is a nerdy idea but these are public investment ideas that paid off the city's highway system one of the first to have this inner collected a loop system and it just seemed like when you look\nBack at like one of the hallmarks of a high marks for San Antonio's history and like this is really paid off it was public investment projects that worked yes yes and and public investment projects\nToday is the last day to take part in these Chevron new member challenge sign up to become a new member of Houston Public media right now and Chevron will donate ... all one hundred dollars make your donation online or by calling eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven\nSeas of San Antonio's economic standing is is there still remains this massive gap between the rich and the poor that you could have identified in the Nineteen thirties which you could have identified in the Eighteen thirties and no doubt back into the Eighteenth century\nThe twin character of poverty on this stage would be race\nYeah and I think that's that's I mean here's where San Antonio is unusual in some ways that that the question of um\nMore ethnicity than race in a sense because it's always had a very ... relatively small black population but it's had a very large end to a degree of really influential a Latino population from the very beginning obviously when when this was actually a Spanish slash Mexican city\nUm but race ethnicity and impoverished Schmidt have been deeply ingrained in the city's history and remains so um and I as I say in the book it's it's you know if we don't fix this by the time we get to the fore hundredth anniversary\nWe've really failed as a community and I say we even though I'm no longer living there my heart lies in San Antonio deeply um and I live in a city that is also a Spanish City that is also got tremendous wealth and huge\nPoverty um and so the southwest generally has the same dynamics whether it's Phoenix Tucson San Antonio El Paso or Los Angeles or many of the pressures are exactly the same um and it is to their shame I think it's fair to say\nThat questions of poverty of education does possession and marginalization of the poor are are so consistent as they are\nYou do write about some of the characters from San Antonio of organized like Ernie Cortez for citizens organize for public service cops he's a recipient of a MacArthur genius award and he helped organize San Antonio out west side church parishes and other groups outside\nAnd this five part series I'm going to look at how the crisis has changed the world\nAnd the countries most affected trust in the third season experts has been eroded and populist politicians have gained power globally the U.S and Europe have been ... by the crisis whereas Asian Russia have been emboldened by it\nBut we begin in the U.S where the crisis began crumble had been looming for years but the big trigger was the collapse of one of the biggest investment banks in the U.S on the fifteenth of September two thousand age\nLimit brothers is going bankrupt and financial markets from Asia to Europe are doing their nose to prevent Monday from turning from dark\nEmployees of America's fourth largest investment banks saw the writing on the wall late Sunday after talks to pull them back from the abyss collapse\nThe consequences of media and devastating professor Joe Stiglitz was received the Nobel Prize for economics explains the significance of this event\nThe financial crisis led to the most serious economic downturn in a global economic downturn since the great depression tens of millions of people lost their jobs over the world and it took a decade for the economy is to get back on track\nIn the sense that growth resumed\nBut if you look at where the economies are today compared to where they appear to be going where they would have been had there not been the crisis\nThe gap would never go away so the cost in terms of the American economy is literally between five and ten trillion dollars and for the European economy is probably even greater than that [noise]\nI'm standing where it will be gone in the doorway of the building ... used to occupy new\nWith ten years ago ... arrived at work to be told that their bank was ...\nLittle gray was a senior manager at least ... at the time\nYou know flying I went home and watch the NBC watched all of my colleagues that not all of my colleagues that many of my colleagues Clinton thing\nTo get boxes to take that personal items I decided to go home\nI turn a lot ... than I was hoping that bankruptcy was not the end result but fortunately it was\nThe financial crisis has its roots irresponsible behavior by banks money was loans to people to buy houses they couldn't afford\nThese loans were packaged up and sold on to other banks have been slice and dice them into complex financial instruments that could be sold on to someone else\nBanks made more money and the bankers' bonuses going high\nThere's a lot of pressure to do more and more idealistic has very honestly he's out of work and lost faith that you make money and you're compensated based on production\nI think that in that competitive environment deals or done that shit [noise]\nWith more and more people defaulted on their loans and houses were repossessed house prices collapsed\nThe banks at the center of the spider Web of loans founded liabilities that is what they owed far exceeded what they could get back go hunting reserves that's their assets\nBanks like Lehman Brothers found that the formula lucrative involvement in the slicing ... and ... packaging of loans into what we're known as credit derivatives had lifted hugely exposed to terrible financial risk\nThey had back the whole business on credit derivatives and they hadn't even bread lines and they weren't the only ones it was estimated at the time the five hundred trillion dollars of derivatives were issued which is about six times the size of the world economy [noise]\nThe U.S government had previously rescued banks but decided not to do so in the case of women's was this that led to panic and history and\nThe financial markets all of a sudden banks didn't trust each other and we're prepared to lend to anyone the system froze\nMy friend Mohammad El Erian who was the head of one of the largest us fund managers pimco at the time of the crisis has a good way of explaining what happened\nI think of it in terms of you driving into a McDonald's to pick up a hamburger I live in California so we're very proud of how efficient a dry food saw\nAnd what normally happens order and then you go to one window where you pay and then the next window which is within ... meters or even if you obtain your meal\nWhat happened during the financial crisis is that what people got to the pavement window\nAnd ... off to pay day mistrust in the system requested immediate settlement they wanted to handle this white that\nBut the system is not good for that the system is built for you costing the next ten metres way you're paying your meal\nBut if you don't trust it next and meat is what happened to think you go away hungry even though you have the ability to pay for your meal and hadn't made us down the west to impose a way to food even though it has to be petted and was willing to sell it to you\nSo willing buyers and sellers cannot participate\nAnd that is what happened because crush disappeared because counter party with what seems to be too high everything stopped\nAnd and why did the suddenly happened why didn't trust us ... become too high\nBecause no one imagined that team and would fail\nAnd no one imagined that lead middle fail and disorderly way even failed or your Monday morning I remember very clearly on Wednesday evening being still at the office calling home and saying please go pretty cash machine\nAnd pull out the maximum cash we care which was about five hundred dollars and I was asked why and I said face simply I don't know whether the banquet open tomorrow\nThe global repercussions immediate ... renowned economist and senior un advice and\nTook a very very short period of time for the a crisis to spread throughout the entire world economy\nAnd the image that most of the leaders had in mind was that we might be entering another Great Depression I think in a way they're panic was over done actually because\nReacting to panic by more panic is not necessarily the right way to do with the Franklin Roosevelt had a different idea\nOn march fourth Nineteen thirty three when he said\n\nThe fear was absolutely palpable and this was a crisis that started at the heart of world capitalism on Wall street itself so that\nMade it even more frightening because Wall Street or are not very frightened when terrible things happen to poor people but they're very frightened when bad things happen to rich people\nThe extraordinary thing about the financial crisis is that it happened in finance as this is the most sophisticated

I mean we are we are getting close now to a potentially being out for that tournament\nMatthew thank you know the decision on whether Brett Kavanaugh should become a Supreme Court judge has come to dominate us politics Republicans and Democrats to sharply gifting beans any televised hearing into allegations of sexual misconduct against the judge\nOn friday the FBI was asked to investigate those allegations so what exactly will involve David go Mrs retired FBI special agent who knows this particular procedure well I also have some more details on the scope of the investigation\nWhat we know from media reports is that the president has or what's known as the supplemental background investigation of judge Kavanaugh to take a look at the allegations that were raised during the testimony before in Senate confirmation hearing\nIs a weak enough because Democrats and others are saying that simply not enough time to get to the buffet some of some of the issues are arriving here as a write off to fish will deadline\nWell it may not get to the bottom of every issue but it's certainly enough time for the FBI to complete the task that they've been given initially from the president as I understand that the task was to interview\nFor all of the individuals whose names were brought up during the hearings professor for mark judge in Mr Smith and there was the fourth name that I don't recall all of whom can either corroborate Dr Ford Oregon corroborate\nA judge Kavanaugh's versions of events that's a very small task actually very simple to locate it in your view those people regarding the allegations\nMark judge of course this is the friend that Brett Kavanaugh who's are accused of being present when some of the alleged issues took place he said that either he doesn't recall and they ... the problems that some of the statements on the accusation simply wasn't true ... ten FBI agent sitting in front of him\nDo differently to ... to find out what he is saying holds water will not\nWell one thing that happens when the FBI comes out to interview is that there is an admonition usually the book or the false statements to the FBI is separate crime from anything else that they might be investigating so there is usually a a\nA good reason for a person can tell the truth or the second thing is the FBI investigators there'll be sending out our experience investigators they're independent of politics and the process\nThey want to provide a balance look at the allegations and there are skilled at getting people to confide in them where they might not complied with the press the media or or partisan politician so the hope is that they will ah open up to the FBI\nAnd perhaps their memory will be a\nWill be stimulated by the uh the occasion they'll provide additional information that may lead other other places\nAnd is it your under our understanding that the FBI would that have the authorization to do those subsequent interviews or for quiet\nWell that's a that's a question that's kind of up in the air the president seemed to indicate that they could follow the lead to where they wanted to go but there may be some conflict with the office of legal counsel which works for the president this is all going to depend on what the director ... director Christopher Wray tells his age and if you want them to do\nI truly believe that there'll be able to follow a logical leads what the president will probably not allow them to do\nIs to go out into other allegations that are not related to the one that made by a doctor\nFor or any of the other people that are are authorized for interview\nThis was still in negotiations with the with the Senate so we'll have to see how it plays out in the next other news once they do\nComplete the investigations within the scope of whatever is allowed to them within the scope of the time will happen next to do they give a recommendation did they say yes this person is state for example to be a judge on on the Supreme Court\nNo and background investigations the FBI never provides a recommendations or conclusions the agents in the field who are conducting these interviews and boom will not actually\nHave any input into summaries that are provided to the White House\nIn the report in the investigation\nThey will simply complete their their interviews send them electronically to FBI Headquarters where they will be completed and placed into a report and there will be an executive summary of the contents of the interviews at the beginning and that will be provided to the White House\nAs David government is a retired FBI special agents talking about the FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh who's the Trump's nominee for Supreme Court judge\nTo the

the loneliness and has carried out an experiment for a program called all in the mind it's discovered that young people are the most likely to feel known any more than fifty five thousand people to pounce making it the biggest study of known in this in the world\nPeople age between sixteen and twenty four experienced loneliness more often and more intensely than any of the age group Coney Hammond is the present of health check\nThe b._b._c. will set us so we found that forty percent of the people in that age group said that they often will very often felt lonely and then gradually as people get older that number went down but still over Seventy five twenty seven percent was saying that they are always often felt lonely\nNow of course these figures are quite high and it's partly it was it was on lines that people could decide themselves whether to take part so that made it might have made them a bit higher of rule but I think what is really striking is these differences between the age groups\nSo that people were telling us that they felt disconnected that they felt left out\nI'm On that they didn't feel\nComfortable in the neighborhoods necessarily that they that wasn't somebody they could um you know bar a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nBut why is that is it because older people are more resilient to worries about learning it\nI think that's really good point I think one of the things is that we know that when you're very young it is a time when people feel ... very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness\nAnd older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the ... they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it's something about life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never measured before may be used as a time when you feel more lonely\nAnd that's interesting because there's going to ask about social media but you said older people have felt learning when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas then there'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite lonely right\nYeah so we did all the the ... if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type parks\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from in the U.S has kind of comfortable uh levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they had higher levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent it's not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister or any of this year to set up punching levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with as which is what you were pointing to in being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWell we asked people what solutions they found it was for them in a closer to something as big as it is to find out what is actually what for people to for people they know it is amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or oh dedicating all the time to work or study or hope is max was joining a social club that also came a list of most um helpful suggestions that people make so it's not for everybody\nI'm changing your thinking to make it more positive to to look I'm On the bright side of things of of a sea sometimes easier said than done\nAnd I I thought number four was interesting that you're starting a conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle oil milk ... or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human and we were on in the same well\nAnd you can listen to the full results of that so they only loneliness on the health check program BBC will say this this Wednesday at twenty sassy GMT\nNow a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's

heat waves that march with the weather patterns across Asia and you know go from almost all the way from Europe to like\nJapan and some of these things are happening at the same time and solve them are displaced a little bit of time but basically most of the northern hemisphere was affected by heat waves at some point this summer\nMy own experience if this dramatic some it was the prolonged heat

counts\nFor England not the case a whole we ended up having the hottest summer on record the u._k. as a whole basically tied with some of the previous years\nBut it was a very substantial heat wave\nAnd the you know if you look at not the summer as a whole but individual days there were times where you had stations setting all time records at it that gets a little repetitious that we look at you know it's hot it's still hot and it's going to get hotter and you know you can compared to previous years so for example\nBack in Nineteen Seventy six when the u._k. was having a major heat wave\nAnd the u._k. summer that was similar to the u._k. summer this year\nBut in that year it was only the u._k. though is having this major heat event whereas this year\nIs he the events you know spread all across the world and those broad swath of heat are was concerning factors of global warming\nAnd I guess for the u._k. of have to wait for four years to see that\n... broken boats\nOn the other hand there have been quite a lot of hot summers in the past decade and I'll probably won't have to wait another forty years for it to be broken again\nIn fact that the rate we're going by twenty fifty or so you would expect about half the years to be as warm as this year\nIncreasing numbers of climate scientists of digging into these weather data to understand better the impacts of global warming among them Oxford University Freddie also a founding member of the world where the attribution project which is already analyzed the European heat wave\nLast interesting thing about global more often so when all this thing no preference than when all in Europe they think starting in may and then there are more or less long so I'm very in tune I\nI'm not let this very long can you know very warm summer weather\nAnd it was so widespread as well\nYeah it was a stationary and let's go sell all Nolan Europe at this way I think it's also interesting or surprising all that at the same time we'll wait and all and how to share so that we're all the way from Japan and that way he lived in North America is a long tail or the very heart\nOf this was not the same way it was just the way and of course is the whole life he all but I think that's the biggest difference between for example the ... ... ... that were big heat wave aware\nThat we're no heat wave that we're at now in Europe and that way that we had a way to get in a law law than Europe including people\nThat were also the heat wave shorter one at different times over the summer and the rest of the northern hemisphere and I think that\nWell that's kind of what we asked\nWell maybe but I Am\nThe hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all kinds of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be held comma\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shots a gr off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight you sign up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual averages fu ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages early parts of the climate story and not the ... the masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers\nToo often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens it in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless Oslo to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nOf course you know write that one and then kill what Iran is not necessarily a harbinger of what the common way to protect the reasons why we do attribution any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's\nRight to say this is something different something that that needs to be quite rare and is now a relatively calm and and then\nShowing that climate change is in fact leading to a greater tendency for these storms to stall when they make landfall and that was really the final climate change threat that we saw play out\n[noise] the last place I Want to look is the region with climate change is having the solstice effect\nIn the Arctic it too has been affected by the unusual whether it's twenty Eighteen infect the impact that were parents first says glaciologist Judy ... from the U.S national snow and ice data center\nPoll we had record lows TIs conditions over the winter and we look at you know if you look at air temperatures over the winter\nCertainly December was I think the one that we've recorded in January February when maybe the second warmest months out of the winters since Nineteen eighty so I mean definitely we had very unusual winter conditions and these winter warm temperatures are starting to impact the ice gross\nI mean to put this seems to me that this is it gets ... when the sun's shining the main thing about the ... the shining the north pole on December the twenty second\nRight but what we have seen happening and then it is to the last um three winters as we're having these storms that are tracking up into the Arctic bringing warm moist air so in the wintertime if you have ... coming up to the Arctic they're actually going to bring in warm moist air that can help melt the surface even in the middle of winter\nUm whereas in the summertime if you have a cycling coming in usually that's says it was cooler conditions you're blocking sunlight and maybe you would have less the ice melt so the cycle and are different depending on what time of year the coming into the Arctic\nAnd and one thing we have noticed I mean we don't necessarily see a change in cycling frequency in the wintertime necessarily with the ice loss right now\nBut we are seeing maybe an increase frequency of extreme psych loans and they're starting to track further north so the I said Jim winters pushing for urban north any cycles actually tracking it further than they used to which can impact the sea ice especially like in the care and the parents the where they usually come in in the wintertime\nDespite that very poor start the Arctic ice has not melted is false this summer as it did in twenty twelve the a ... a big regional storm push the melting of the current record\nIn part that's because the flip side of those heat waves in the Americas Europe in Siberia has been a cold ... system was over the north pole but that's little comfort to Judy and ... says the strong decline in Arctic ice is still in evidence for him to trim sects since the ... uh twenty seven\nWould say that this summer circulation patterns we had in two thousand seven if that happened today we would have a new record low because it was a very unusual summer as well not in terms of a big storm coming in and you had this high pressure that persisted over the Beaufort Sea\nAll summer long and under high pressure you tend to have clear skies you have a lot of solar radiation hitting the ice that that was that high pressure was coupled with low pressure over Siberia for example\nAnd so what that did as it created a very strong pressure gradient between high and low pressure centers which brought more than ... from the south into the Arctic Sea funneled all this warm went into the Arctic he also pushed the ice away from the coast of Siberia and Alaska towards the north pole\nAnd you help flush more I set of friends straight so all of those things happened\nAnd that was able to cause at first to record low that we saw in two thousand seven which also took scientists by surprise because we didn't think he could lose that much ice that quickly\nAnd it did show that the ice has become quite vulnerable to these unusual atmospheric patterns because the ice just enough now that if you have\nA very strong circulation pattern that sets up that will favor ice melt you going to lose a lot of ice very quickly if you have a storm come in and depending on the time of year that it comes in and where it comes in because you have a vulnerable ice pack because it's then it can create a lot of damage\nAnd so what's happened in the Arctic is if the weather is benign you're still going to have less the ice but it won't be as\nBut if you had the dramatic weather pattern that comes in you're going to lose a lot of ice very quickly and I think that's what we're seeing is just that vulnerability has increased for having a dramatic ice loss event\nIt's definitely a matter of when not if for the melting records will be broken\nNight ended with the Arctic because it's the rapidly changing conditions that that many scientists suspect I'll just stay bling whether far away I'll be talking about that in next week's edition of discovery with the BBC and those pushing the view include climatologist Michael Mann\nWho says we should smart not to the connection between global warming and changing whether\nGlobal warming doesn't cause a meteor logical event to happen what it does is it can take that event and it can intensified in various ways\nHurricanes can become stronger they can carry more moisture with them and deal more flooding potential and or even these mid latitude storm systems\nCan be much greater flooding threats in these high pressure centers in the summer are becoming deeper and hotter and that's where we're seeing record breaking heat and drought and wildfires break out so it's intensifying these weather systems in a way\nThat is doing great damage and it's a relevant to ask did climate change\nYou know caused this storm to form\nIt's a question we can never really answered the better question is once this storm began to form was it intensified by climate change and we now have great confidence that in many ways the answer is yes\n[noise] everybody's talking about

threat\nChina on George is a big theme in today's program first off do you see any reason for optimism here that this North American deal might pave the way for a Trans Pacific they told\nA no not really because I think the um the discussions which the United states has been having with Mexico and Canada\nUm are really about the terms under which the country's trade with one another [noise]\nThe terrorists or bitterness war the trade war that's going on between the America in China is sensibly about the terms of trade but actually underneath it's really much more existential it's about uh the struggle for technological leadership\nA ... tree dominance and about the rules and regulations governing accepted rules and regulations governing industrial policy intellectual property as soon as you indicated just now and as such I think\nUh this is going to go on for quite some time I mean Jack Ma recently founder of Ali Baba ah recently said he felt betrayed well would go on for Twenty years I don't know about that but it's very difficult to see an off ramp at the moment\nHow um how are they affecting China's economy do we know yet too early to say\nYeah well I mean it is beginning to clip 'em up the marching band the Chinese economy um be a very ... come close to the watch series of business sentiment indicators for September or who just came out to actually before we were on their\nUm indicated that the economy had a we can through September we export sector of the economy was beginning to um contracts actually out in the margin\nOr so I'm obviously it's not the biggest thing in China because China is not really a kind of a such a trade dependent economy anymore but it's it's big but it has a lot of influence over your employment and ah ah conditions were

China's own economies that have been precious they're ready for president she\nYes I'm I'm I think the reason for that just because at the beginning of two thousand Seventeen\nUm China embarked on this I'm a sort of crack down on finance to try to um a kind of limited but certainly climbed down on the most egregious forms of risk taking them for natural malpractice\nAnd this means quite successful in some respects or in the sense that um you know leverage in the economy borrowing a and bad behavior by a by banks and financial companies actually has being a child and so the
