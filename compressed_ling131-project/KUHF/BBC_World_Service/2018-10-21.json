{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "So so you have also been generating fortune cookie fortunes using AI you've said thousands of fortune cookie fortunes into into your program it's been spitting out its own fortune cookie fortunes what are your favorite examples\nKind of like the more existential dread ones [laughter] so there was one that says your pain is the essence of everything and the value of nothing that's kind of that's kind of skating that hurt\nThe expense of your thoughts they may never happen are quite well but but fortunately you think of it as being something that's kind of fun and fluffy and post perennial and and convince deal why do you think you're a I went so dark and weird when it was given the chance to write the room\nI'm there could be the structure of fortune cookie is they're they're quite formulaic so you think about it like\nYour days will be filled with happiness going to be one fortune and you will never be depressed severe did your days will be filled with depression and you will never be happy yeah things like that so the ending of some and the beginnings of others um and I think that has to do with the structure of things as they are written\nAlex you've recently fed text from the current and the Bible into one of your systems and it's generating the attacks are you trying to start a new religion [laughter]\nNo no I just thought it'd be interesting to see where the model would find things which are similar between them hum and yes some of the things that printed out work quite ah interesting like the fortune cookies can you give me an example one that I remember as a\n... in large to my steps with butter which is kind of interesting so you have ones that\nYou have outputs that are really sort of you know and our shall not blah blah blah sort of following the formula and then you get surprises in there where you don't sound religious at all\nRight I was gonna say non theological thing have you been large somebody at absolute butter it's affecting that at the same kind of weight that the Bible does so this is fun but what is the point of it all what does it tell you what are you looking for\nWell a lot of my art work is put out there for people to ask questions especially about technology and humanity\nUm so I don't necessarily go looking for some answer as much as I go looking for some prompt or some interesting experience someone can have with an art work I have my own interpretation of what it means to me but I like to leave things open ended because\nYour interpretation of the art work just as valid as mine and when you have your own experience of it it's more powerful because it means something special to you\nBut we're also experiencing the gap between the things that humans say and write and how AI constructs things can do do you think are as part of what you're exploring the question that neural net can never create anything close to the kind of metaphysical ideas that we as humans are capable and do you believe\nIt I could write a poem like John done [noise] yeah\nI mean right now will be departing systems have their eye systems are based on models which learn off lots of data so you could feed a John ... data set into a system and it would generate more poems of his style the question of can be truly creative and do something no one's ever seen before\nI'm not sure and I think there's a possibility that that can happen with increasing technology\nYou know instead of training it on a model of just one poet what if you turn it on every living poet that's ever been around\nOr what if you want even larger and and trained it on literature whether it be poetry or a play or or novel and have it may be invent a genre of writing that we've never seen before haven't even thought about as as humans so um I think those are those are interesting spaces to think about\nBut it's so do you think it's inevitable or do you do you think it's it's also possible that that they'll never be able to do that simply because there are so many ideas that are that are not a matter of structure that then they're not a matter of style there they they they take place in a different kind of level entirely intellectually\nYeah uh I think it could be that we might hit a wall where we won't see creativity it'll be really good at doing things like training at the the stop signs or self driving cars [laughter] um but not good at creating new types of poetry or there could be some breakthrough where it makes poetry that we find awful but may be\nA stimulating for other people earning systems which judge poetry um yeah\nAlex you've been tweeting some of the fortune cookies out on Twitter what's been your favorite reaction to the fortune cookies that you've shared\nYes it's my favorite reactions are one it's sort of personal to people yes and one of the ones I got a lot of reactions was\nI Am a bad situation um a lot of people could relate to that one and that's when people like to share as well to sort of output their frustration I suppose with their personality people took them as sort of these philosophical quotes and sort of having discussions around them and I've I've found that great\nAlex there's so there's so much to explore and in in terms of the search for meaning and the possibilities that a A R is going to

marsh lost him if he buys the Saudi account of Mr ...\nNo I don't think it passes the laugh test and this is not a laughing matter but it's just not something that more than just take one of the strike face so\nI'm hoping that uh the United kingdom France Germany on our country I think they are working together for coordinated response and obviously we've got more entail ourselves to go through I'm sure over time I don't think any\nOf the audio tapes have made it to the United states yet or at least I'm not aware that they have\nSo I think this is still a few days from maturing but uh no I Do not find what they upset plausible at all and actually I think it's very much hurt their credibility around the world is certainly has here in our country what\nIs the best way for to go about establishing the truth if the\nTurks actually have this audio tape and I realized that they don't like their modes\nOf collecting intel to be known but I think they need to go ahead and share those with the United states and with the United kingdom and other countries so that we can go through that and that was the the way to end this and for everybody to know exactly what happened\nIf those tapes exist\nWithout those type I still think that it would be very apparent to me that this is Saudi responsibility and\nFrom my perspective I Would tend to believe at this point that it was at the highest levels of government so while I Know they're looking at if you will dealing with twenty three twenty four people in their own country and prosecuting them my sense is that this couldn't have happened without NBS his approval and if we're all\nAlready so sad to say you are you are saying that it is your belief that crown prince Mohammed bin some members directly implicated in the mode all from Jamal ...\nYeah based on what I Know today and they're still more to be known and I may be proven wrong\nBut my belief today is that this is something that was probably ordered by NBS\nCarried out by people who are who are close to him and he was murdered now we may find other information soon but the fact that they have continued to put out non credible stories like the one they've just put out about him getting into a fist fight with them and being killed\nThose non incredible stories even make me more so believe that this is something that uh they're trying to shelter the person at the very top of their regime\nIf the United states should game possession of side to audio and video evidence if it indeed exist and it does demonstrate\nAs the Turkish media has been saying that ... she was tortured and to spend but inside the Saudi ... how van should the United states proceed\nWell it's my sense in talking to some of the other and ... that many of the western countries are looking to the United states for leadership on how\nAll of the countries the western countries if you will shed respond but my sense is that we collectively need to figure out a way to do that and that that entails conversations between us we all have some or\nIf you will interest in Saudi Arabia I don't know that I can give you a specific answer I Know that uh I'm committed to working with secretary of state ... and others to figure out\nPeople are on the other side of the Senate to figure out the appropriate way forward and we need to be thoughtful about it I mean we need to we need to\nThat uh you know Saudi Arabia is a very unusual place none of us have a lot of insight into who the next later might be if in fact NBS is not the leader so this is one of those things where none of us need to react with pure emotion\nThink this through and make sure that\nDoing or doing in a coordinated way but look I I think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do you think western governments what perhaps too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine and uh\nWe're wrong to believe that he was a reformist\nYou know if you set with any of the very impressive individual when he talks about the future of the country and\nPrivatizing aramco and diversifying into other areas and making sure that country's future is not just focus on fossil fuels but diversifying to take care of the names of future generations or\nHis willingness to take on the the most fundamental harvest and the country to do some progressive things to happen both for human rights and other reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch and he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what he did in ... and the white did it without communicating to other countries will no doubt a rookie mistake\nWhat he did and arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt as a rookie mistake\nAnd in the order of this which it would appear that he may have done certainly this is goes beyond rookie mistake and goes into the area being absolutely ruthless we know of what he did at the Ritz Carlton where I detained\nOpposition folks shut them down torture some of them and so I think we just need to understand that hood as we're dealing with\nAnd what has tendencies have ban and now that this kind of activity could continue on for many many years and collectively we've got to figure out a way of having a policy to deal with it that gets to an outcome that is good for the world if you will\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker speaking to my colleague Judy an emotional\nNow in the last two years millions of Venezuelans have left the country because of its economic collapse a nation of oil riches now has shortages of food and other basic goods limited power supplies and an annual inflation rate that could reach one million percent by the

I Do think that Britain as in the middle of a real crisis because what you've heard that as evidence of the extraordinary passion and division to sort of poison the ... ... ... into to old Great Britain was a divide that there is\nThat you've also got a governing conservative policy that's just an Pluto Brexit you have a main opposition labor policy that's not seen as a credible governments\nYou've got businesses now profoundly worried about what Brexit light may ... the child says of a breakdown in the talks between the u._k. and you are\nGetting high us oh I'm Sorry to be so obsolete gleaming rarely does things to me that we're in a way that we are really in a crisis it may not feel like that's a lot of older people but you take that sort of\nI guess I describe it as the sort of the poisoning division the ... district in this country like nothing else I have seen in sociology as as a reporter\n... as you say I'm really glad we had you on the program sorry at this stage in the proceedings and when you look at opinion polls do you see any significant shift in public opinion\nOn this well you know I'm not a pollster but I guess what has happened to the Senate it's sort of settled down that the if you think about it or leave it remained by almost ... percent yes the poles of now settled into Chicago pretty consistently of about seven percent of people are now saying that it was the wrong decision\nTo vote to leave the European Union but here's the thing\nI think a lot of people in this month's yesterday ... would understand that's what I think that hasn't quite well hasn't been yet as some massive decisive\nA public shift against ... said I mean it's true that the opinion polls consistently suggests that most people think that the government is amazing thing making the most old might seem asked that they are in a shambles as a social with of chaos\nBut I think what you clearly haven't had an interesting ... to ... ...\n... there's no evidence that sort of people who voted leave have on ... uh uh we made a horrible mistake\nI Would open it up a Rosenman thoughts on that maybe or anything else you wish to observe before I get back to world\nAnd I had to create ... chef that as well and rice in the past that and oversee stored narrowly passionate and it it it was a chili full price to pay and they say puzzles have but you come away rethinking leaves you the truth the truth of the tree believe as she can passing\nOn yeah I mean did you come across anybody who had voted leave who's now change their mind sufficiently passionately to do something like\nThat today people they they do exist but I just standing there is that that that many of them in the minds of heights and but then again it's the Al Smith challenge and it was somebody trying to direct people and getting to a guy and a different way and to the staff but not that difficult to change people's minds\nIsn't that right it's not and I thought well that's the problem is you know that kind of a daddy\nLook I think the the my worry is that the sort of simplistic tools that we have to decide on on these massive questions you know a referendum that simply involves the for now or even an opinion poll that says do you regret\nThe decision isn't going to give us some sort of nuance and there was a fascinating piece of research commissioned by kings College London recently which tested various options an off people to you know with all the nuances of the relationship with Europe ... ... people to rank them and make trade offs\nAnd once you get to is the single largest group of as in Britain wants her relationship with Europe that resemble something like the European economic association now unfortunately none of that new one seems to have crept into public debate let's learn policymaking and so I went back to\nA very divisive simplistic yes no type model um when it comes to the public posturing that many of our political leaders and and I think most people is heading up to the fact that that's not how where they are and um they want a much more sophisticated discussion\nA rope us for that thoughts um what what are your thoughts as a result of hearing them\nNow Iran has a sort of changed my view that we are in an absolute whole I mean the s._s. no two ways about says I mean is that is that sort of toxic combination of having ... votes as all the way people just divided\nLay in aside from within that's another option isn't it\nThat is another option and I do have a few friends although in a decreasing number who are still principal number Trump present are in the Republican Party fighting for their principles but I saw that early on that it was a losing battle after Donald Trump won the presidency of\nPersonal one if I may what you'd like to leave a political party that you've been apart hope for so long I mean how lonely does that become one\nIt's a difficult process no question about it I mean the falling out with friends or having to reorient myself in the world I mean I was a member not just the way political party but of a political tribe and that's really what what the political parties are un American it's startling to see that people change religions more often than they change political parties\nDo you consider yourself now to be a new policy personal view swung as far as now saying you'd prefer to vote Democrat\nI'm not affiliated with any party at the moment but I Am saying that everybody should vote democratic in November because I think it is imperative to have a check and balance on Donald Trump but I think there is a real issue going forward for twenty twenty\nWhat will the Democratic party stand for I I for one would love to see the Democratic party moved to the center and capture the allegiance of a lot of independent voters like me and former Republicans like me\nAnd what would moving to the center mean in practical terms in policy terms and I'm thinking particularly in foreign policy terms which we haven't talked about yet but I Know it's an area of particular interest of your calls at what would the send to ground meat in foreign policy terms for you\nAnd foreign policy I think it would mean reaffirming our alliances stop trashing NATO stop trashing the you stop complaining about American troop deployments\nAnd just one final point about the Republican Party going perhaps a little further back in time than just since Donald Trump became president because that's what you looked into\nIn your book and I'm assuming that you have shifted politically not just because of Donald Trump ... full but what he does so it'd be fair to say that it's because of some of the things that you have\nFound out about the Republican Party and its recent past as a result of delving into it\nThat's absolutely true I ... and the corrosion of conservatism I chronicle my awakening to the Republican Party and the conservative movements dark side which was there all along but I was blind to it essentially because I was part of the tribe and now looking back at the history with with a clear eyed assessment I realized\nOh my goodness the Republican Party has been a catering to racism or for a long time it has become increasingly marred by by ignorance buy an assault on science\nBy a a pandering to to prejudice all these uh critiques that liberals have been making all along that I thought were just ... on the good name of the Republican Party the election of Donald Trump made me realize wait a second this is accurate this is true\nMax Boot to as you head has now left the right I'm telling you what do you make of that\nWell look I think the heat the current heroes of Donald Trump does make me nostalgic for a time when conservatism meant something there was an ideology behind the politics as as as a particular tribe\nAnd what worries me is that not only has there's sort of distinct lack of any coherent ideology behind what say for example the policy actions of Donald Trump at the dismantling of the very institutions that have supported supposed to sort of\n... I'm a keep democracy propped up mhm and that's deeply worrying\nBut the Max Boot argument without ... disparaging seemed to be to go back to something that's been tried before and the voters have rejected\nWell voters are rejecting all ... to the institutions and I think that's where the power of populists like Trump or live in the sense that they say look you're frustrated with the lack of you know how how this institution isn't working that come on board but what they now get is a is a sort of flattery of of\nOf of the Twitter generated policymaking rather than something that's actually coherently based on on ideology\nRun of the things I find fascinating because you know and they eat K we might be looking and some people might actually come paste and I like the fact that she has happened when we might be looking at a red lining about political party\nBut one thing they have forgotten or not when Janice that cake that quite how tribal people had ... young particularly of if a and pay for that can set\nThe case you do fail they see the whole crowd I mean that ... well one thing is really ... how difficult this slave leaving friends that you will say leaving something you've invested so much time and and but I Do think that something really to the fact that people are willing to look at the accidents and I'm over in right now\nAnd say I would change my position and I and I have another is that that I think\nWe can be very cruel people change their mind and I'm not ... it's something we need a lot more generally and I thought I sat\nAt my guest today

War three decades to go to the destruction of hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons Mr Trump accused Russia or if not honoring the code\nRussia violated the river has been violated here for many years that I don't know why President Obama didn't go for a loud [noise] that we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement [noise] I go out as the weapons that were not allowed to\nRussia has denied us claims that it has broken the agreements by developing and deploying band cruise missiles\nHundreds of Central American migrants have taken to ... to cross the river milking the border between Guatemala and Mexico in an attempt to continue to the United states the caravan of thousands of people mostly from ... with less turned it on the frontier bridge from ... ... ... filed this report\nIt is a bridge the for the White House is now an immigration battlefield\nStruggling with them all in Mexico it's currently home to thousands of migrants from Honduras with wanting to get to the U.S [noise] but I still have to get through Mexico which is not letting them in for the Trump is described as ... as an assault on the west\nWe plead to Donald Trump fish woman tells me like gold softened his heart so we can enter the U.S children of sleeping on the floor and we don't know how long will be here it's not fair\nFederal police in Brazil have opened an investigation into information spied on social media during the presidential election campaign\nThe phone right front runner ... that is the portions have denied accusations that they use the messaging app despite fake news addict information in violation of campaign rules he's on South America correspondent Katie Wilson\nThe far right candidate ... has run a very different campaign using what's happened in Facebook is his primary platforms to spread his message and win support\nBut with that he and his followers his face growing criticism and accusations that fake news is being spread to millions of people had that the federal police says it'll look into whether or not companies have been sending mixed messages both in connection to ... and Fernando ...\nCounter accusations by us files and um so you know I think the United states probably has a point that there is a a serious violation going on um although I I I certainly wouldn't of ah wouldn't have taken the step breath and announced today right\nWhy not I mean what are your fears as a result of what he has said\n[noise] well you know [noise] the the reality is that [noise]\nUm the reason that the two parties negotiated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty was because these weapons are extremely the stabilizing\nYou know they have they have very short flight times and so the Soviets were extremely worried that if the west deployed these weapons that that they'd be able to what was called the ... uh the ... will be leadership you know basically assassinate the leadership with nuclear weapons and\nSo it really really generated a lot of tension and a lot of a lot of concern that things had to be on very high rates of alert or to guard against a sneak attack so\nYou know if we're heading back into that world or if we're going back um I Can't understand the kind of simplistic idea that if if the right\nTo have the capabilities we want them to but I think we've all kind of lost sight of the fact that when both sides had these capabilities we we all looked around and thought this is crazy we really shouldn't do this [noise]\nJeffrey I'm going to end the conversation they appreciate your time because the line is a little bit dicey but who knows when you but thank you very much for coming on Jeffrey Lewis from arms control ... dot com that sees blog I'm done you would noting towards the end of that conversation with regards to what he was recording from yesteryear\nThat's right and how much of human progress in recent decades has been about creating a rules based international order and\nOne of the things that I Am so very clearly at the United nations just a few weeks ago is that never has that system being on the pressure inside inside many friends I mean this is an example of a bilateral free T but when you look at the the dismantling of multilateral known and conventions and the blatant disregard\nWe're entering a very dark and dangerous ear and human\nHis but if a signatory is on aging and agreements isn't it an incumbent on you ultimately as the other signatory to say well if you don't meet is we're out\n... and look imagine all of the weeks months years spent in preparing that document dismantling it with with almost no negotiation that seems um seems rather counter productive and potentially dangerous or\nOne of the problems of crossing from can really I mean I feel I feel some methane that same thing and putting on Clinton thing how important it is to someone who's in that sense that makes it very very important and the problem is and you can even say quick hand\nThey it doesn't get the attention it does that mean granted it disgusting that will be onto the next thing and we wind is still well hang on what are the knock on effect that that's how does this all play out\nAnd that's what's really worry me at the moment and then when they say that to deliberate tactic of college costs I mean it it's a it's a ... ... as having control is Nathan and in fact pass on\nSixty minutes of you know as we heard on weekend yesterday it has been confirmed by the Saudi authorities at the dissident journalist ... is dead and they said that a fistfight started\nAfter he went into the Saudi ... she lives in Istanbul adding that they're being a series of arrests and ... in the kingdom following that incident speaking to reporters in Nevada President Trump was asked if he was satisfied with the response from Riyadh\nNot satisfied or do we find the answer but it was a big first that was a good first step but I Want to get to the answer\nOr yes in ... is a chief advisor to the Turkish president Richard type or the one who was a close friend of ...\nMissed act was also the person that Mr ... us he's voicing fiance to telephone if he didn't reemerge from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the second of all toga and he's been speaking to my colleague Julie emotional\nIt was exact date for for ... am and I was ... it was an unknown number on my idol from the phone on a on a sweaty worried and ready access to it was I can I I I don't know of course had at the who is did\nAnd she said I Am defiance you'll see Jim ... he entered the confidence five hours to go he I haven't left the confidence and I am very very worried because before he entered the consulate he told me that you see anything wrong at or anything on expected things happen\nAnd it is cold enough that and of course I was surprised to hold these and I tried to understand what's happening\nOn the corner from where I'm from salt out of you who knew him ... I said them you know Jamal 'cause she she had gone to the conflict and he hasn't left yet\nThey moved to believe that it's probably a little shocked\nThey said the Wii told not to go it is very dangerous for him because he's being\nWritten by the Saudi Government they are seeking for him they said do whatever you can do you ah ... I was little the cheating or ... and you can\nDo many things and then I needed the rules the phone and I called the ... center of turkey and also I called the ... the president\nI mean at one point to Mr tied to to say on the west did you fans that come out ... G was not going to come out to update consulate that um something had happened to him\nI was voted not because he will be achieved in the ... that was something that unexpected and and I think we'll think which will be possible for all my you mentioned\nYou shouldn't vote the confidence of international relations of\nCourse she wrote in conversation and deep conversation or in and out of a month ago\nTalking about the possibility all sold out in the gym making some kidnapping or arresting people abroad when it comes to turkey she said it it's almost impossible to believe in in Turkey because Minnesota ... paying much much attention much significance\nAnd its relationship with turkey because they have very good traditions and they don't want to put it in to risk he were feeding himself safe for even into chi\nHe's she was not because he's been here about his fish was to be kidnapped or can be arrested them being sent to so that yeah\n[noise] so what do you think happened to your mouth shut the inside the Saudi consummate\nDefeat chilies almost complete said as soon as he enters a call so they know the short time he has been kicked I think without explanation that's made by Saudi Government that he was he says he's five or something like is impossible of course is on convincing clay because\nFifteen guys it won by the way I see Mexico she fights he has been lynched\nI think they came intending ... to ... and ... he's bloody\nAnd so they are not that much could do was to think about some deep pays for example the just waiting for him outside and if something is wrong capital and showed inform me or somebody s\nTech he promised to reveal every detail about the killing of your mouth shut gee\nDoes it mean by that is it going to make the audio and video evidence of his killing which has said to exist as he can make that more generally available make it available perhaps to foreign governments\nI think turkey has many many of them because the prosecutor or the intelligence or the security forces are from the beginning collecting old evidences old Cruz's old data\nAnd all that are on the immigration and they are being studied and they are being analyzed out of these on the rise that will come of where they where they do have to just about to attack them nothing will be kept a secret\nSo turkey is determined to continue challenging the Saudi version of the death of Jamal ... G your determined to do that even though that might be diplomatic consequences for turkey\nFor the diplomatic additions doesn't contain to hide the crimes that is a criminal issue here and this cannot be kept secret that cannot be hiding in the sense of justice should not be needles\nCould I just interrupt that because all you tending towards now accusing the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man of all during the mud or rub Jamal ...\nActually a ... a closing nobody you cannot it costs to anybody because Steve the investigation results officially hasn't come yet\nThat was ... chief advisor to the Turkish president ... to one and a close friend of ... to ... G and just on that last point Rosenman close friend to the ... degree I Wonder whether the personal side of this story has been lost as people have rushed to talk about the geopolitics\nUh yes I suspect that that is true I Am\nOne of the things that I Am raising less bad mouth shut me was putting up with in the run up to his death say he was receiving\nA crazy amount as a piece on line with friends that she talked about that than as well um and you know he's way camp every morning to ... and stuff and it was really really weighing on him as as you might imagine it would be very nice need training\nAnd say well let's see he knew he was in um uh you know in in in ...\nI'm ... so listening something the ... dying from being of actual threat of it being a ... very different thing but I think we have we have forgotten ... say as well in the less I mean I I kept thinking that I've been watching it was a horrific\nAmid reports of self home and suicides\nSome say that might be one of the reasons why the government just raised the possibility of allowing the asylum seekers to settle in New Zealand\nWith one condition they have to agree never to set foot in Australia in their lives so is that possible we'll ... we'll look on the line to discuss it to to get that we've done in rose up and\nJulian ... law professor at University of Melbourne and former president of the Australian human rights commission Julian welcome to the program\nThank you very much and the ... government who's an MP in New Zealand or he was ... as a child and then became the first refugee elected to New Zealand parliament ... welcome\nThank you good to have you on the program I'm can we start I'm dealing with the practicalities of the ... is it possible to do as well I just described\n[noise] well um it's probably for practical purposes going to be very difficult to fulfill the as we all know with\nDigital computers it's possible ... maintain surveillance other people and and possibly to prevent someone ever returning\nA badge and that it's going to be a difficult thing to achieve thoughts about possible\nBut they have to see the other point that needs to be understood is that this proposed ban\nUh it would actually have an effect ... widely than those\nA hundred and fifty on a on the roof man is a but could affect all those who have arrived in Australia since twenty Thirteen as so cold or an authorized maritime arrivals I'm so they we now have\nPerhaps a wicked problem of trying to decide whether the government should how are they allowed to hold the hostages that the children as hostage and their families across a to this proposal for a band that would affect a hundreds of possibly thousands of other people I it's a very difficulties here\nI mean there is free movement is in between New Zealand Australia\nFor that it that it's precisely that pressure economic relations agreement that allows for eight minutes and that\nThat has created in in a way the problem because if an asylum seeker ... a refugee which will be settled in another country they would ... some form of these are noted come back to Australia which would be a mechanism at one whatnot safe all blocking their ... and if that's what the government wants to do\nThat with New Zealand there is a rides a of all New Zealand is to uh to to free movement into Australia so that is that he's in pot the reason why this ban is seen\nAs a ... the ... the government does not want anybody who's being removed from nine to ... to have the opportunity to settle a straight it it's gotten the policy from the very\nTitle so don't ... therefore mean the New Zealand government would have to do in order to make this work\n[noise] yeah well this was of course there is also with ... years ago and and the Fisher Aurora as thin all sorry um and at that point a stray was asking that New Zealand and full of less than ... that that I'm with the things they create um and there was opposition to it from the Green Party which is my last evening as well\nAnd we create this kind of second tier\nResidency or citizenship within Zealand\nUm which was really concerning and now it's ... of course that's sort of going to be terrible Lauren Australia potentially um but uh but of course there is this a issue and I I have been really close contact with the ... the software was made\nTo understand what was happening over there but um you know it's the broad base\nUm approach that those ... low tax which doesn't just affect the uh you know the the ... that New Zealand world have but actually you know it kind of unpaid the rights of\nA ... or ... ha that's come through that kind of the arrival pass 'em because the ... of course for some reason has decided to differentiate between classes of\nOf a Muslim state because uh depending on how they arrive at one of its I Do understand the opposition but but at at at least doesn't affect us and New Zealand sorry the office than what we\nI was gonna say 'cause I just wanted to clarify that before I bring down the road Rosa ... on the broad issue the New Zealand also that you referred to that goes back some time in the past you think that's a good idea that that is a positive from New Zealand point of view\nYeah so the offer was made by a previous a prime minister or John K and it was renewed my immediately by a out prime minister ... when she took office\nSo that that offers um one that stands on and of course the practicalities of become complex F F it as accepted um because of course there are the children and it's Ninety our children um at at last count that I had access to and of course I've got family thought it might\n... there's a lot more people than one fifty is all of that to take a couch all this while\nI'm right so it's from a studio here then I'll come back to you both ...\nYour mind well look I Know that the you know over the last few decades or being point which those pension and the free movement agreement I remember when I was writing complaining about using them to come in living on the Dole and\nRobert ... than from using and prime minister famously once went off to you know what are you worried about ... New Zealand is leading to go to start each had ... will murder because he you know Everytime and he's doing leads to go to Australia\nThe IQ of bugs countries goes up and despite all of that tension never was the principle of free movement um ever really under a serious threat and yet yet here is an example of how to work something desperate politicians become when it comes to immigration and asylum in a few hundred people\nThe future I'm putting at stake of fundamentals of principle of free moving between these two combat than\nYou speak to somebody who grew up in Australia as a refugee\nI'm this is one of the things I wanted off doing about my parents um found in ... when I grew up in in a period in which started was a very welcoming nation and you know one or two off duty and where where is public sentiment these days in terms of these issues\nWell well it's it's an interesting question the end to end the particularly interesting time at which dry skits because ah last night til straight in time we saw in ... I Believe an unprecedented um shift in political support from the government\nA swing of around twenty percent to in this case and independent but in the context of that\n... that was the suggestion put out that the Australian government bought finally except they a generous offer by museum which has been on the table for some some years and indeed one irony is that had Australia accepted that office when it was just made we would have cleared out all the families and children on the roads\nAre there still about twelve hundred people on those two on the two islands [noise]\nUm so I talk to your question they to the extent that the by the action is an indication and I think it is up to a point there is now a a a real public interest in resolving this problem that\nAwhile arguably a the the public could accept that people will be sent to Madison to root for offshore processing with a view to finding some form of ... settlement within a year or two\nBut full five six years later a way ready saying people in desperate circumstances as you say with many suicides and threatens a threat to suicides but also\nA crisis in mental illness so I think that there is a shift\nA but we have to be very careful in in in ... in taking the weight with 'em by the action results as too strong indication of his shift because it was very much in the context of a desperate government trying to to win over a relatively liberal minded\nLike adults are labor not necessarily going to do anything different you\nKnow well that is that does need to be understood that labor introduced a mandatory ... detention that unique provision globally and has since insisted on both ... a nervous about it too so we have to be very favorite I think that the Labour Party will be more\nHumane and they probably will try to get the children off the island with their parents but nothing is sitting in this highly volatile political garbage in Australia Rosemont\nCan I can skip out the feeling in New Zealand in the ass chi chi refugees and migrants because\nI mean obviously in Europe unfortunately we have suffered this will just increase of anti refugee and an anti immigrant rhetoric what'd you asked she'd like in New Zealand to these people and it's always a small number of people\nYeah New Zealand to I'm sort of often identifies itself in opposition to Australia [laughter]\nAs you know we have sort of a Canada us relationships that I'm so serious suddenly the rhetoric of you know as the war on terror and um and that kind of populists a movement that we've seen with the rise of Brits it and Trump\nUm have differently cannot trace it here and you can kind of see that\nI'm On online forums and and and and the rise of a certain type of populist politics here um that depend on on rice and and sort of on a scapegoating of migrants for things like we're having a housing crisis for example none ...\nCertainly has ... and it's sad to say but in tens of that kind of yeah um that kind of intense fear and and and um panic that we see an Australian sometimes this is certainly for example not an election usher in New Zealand either\nProfessor Stephen Hawking store to Lucy or the book we were kind of talking about brief on says to the big questions Rosemarie would you take out a little bit\nUm well what it was given that we're in an era\nWhere expertise and including you know sort of extreme scientific expertise is sort of cool didn't question and I find it rather reassuring\nUm that we listened to the western Stephen Hawking I've read an extract dying from this book I'm at a mental thing ... he's got some very terrifying warnings that I Wish we would take the dolls and in particular he sort of speculates that we might get us in in ... um space but what are we leaving behind you know\nIt's all very well for humanity perhaps\nIf we can find out the wells um but ah we will have left such a mark on this planet and such an extraordinary Leah pulling like I say in terms of what we've done to nature and other animals that that's something that he says will be own offices and stay safe and and I think we should listen very carefully to that\nAnd think about that in our in life\nTo what came to mind as you listen to Lucy\n... by the fact is that the whole thing was as a public intellectual of the highest older\nI'm a ... stands in stark contrast to the public for food and re that we get from many figures and in the media these days and you know he ... at a time when we need deep salt and deep action for to solve some of the big global challenges that we have and some of the big ethical questions [noise]\nUm we need hard workers as Lucy said to her father and smart and her family but we also need these citizen many to respect that was that you know number one of the world's ounces all the big questions are going to be ... and in a hundred and forty characters in ... in tweets and and uh we'll need deep potential not the sort of\nShallow I'm a short attention span that weekend or\nSomething I hadn't really thought about it until she said we'd how important it was um growing up to me to see this is someone with ... stream disadvantage what's the end of his life\nBut as soon as I mean and I don't want to use the word right but but brilliant genius I think that was a really important thing\nAnd then ten cells and my brother went to the college that Stephen Hawking toss out and I remember him texting may in this in his first I'm so excited to see in Stephen Hawking at dinner and the way that sort of inspired and\nAnd I hadn't I hadn't watched it because that he'd just wall was this amazing genius that guy\nUm but actually of course there's another message that was just that we have to make it possible for people um with with severe disabilities to believe that the best by spreading in life that they possibly can and that's something that I think as well we should take from it we should say 'cause on may not possible like it it was to him\nBy as well I mean we we touched on your work in that field I'm again I'm very much and Stephen ... from the book and in other other sentiments of heat expressed over the years one\nOf the things we're looking at in this work on the un high level panel on digital corporation is is around how do we navigate the complex ethics around artificial intelligence or it's not just a question of how do we program robots and manage the relationship between humans and machines but\nIncreasingly it's going to be about what's the ethical framework for example of of when machines ... machines when my machine has different interests and requirements to your machine\nHow do we know so there's a sort of whole ethical dilemma here where we need a solid um beef up sort of a print print set of principles to guide off as we are go through this very uncharted ...\nAgain going back to what you were both saying about Stephen Hawking yes you've got to come up with the principles but you then go to communicate some in a way that people couldn't gross but will not rail against yet and that's tough\nAnd one of his but ... is one of those books that people ... the pages of haven't got much better than but what I Would say about the current one which you know if I'm allowed to or didn't guys you're going to read\nUm is it is that she's very accessible it is written in a way that people you know without scientific expertise could understand and it will make you think and that's what we need a bit more of\nA just one final touching filled that I took out of it has nothing to do with with signs it was more to do with the sort of\nThe child parent relationship when she made the observation about the amount of time that he was happy to dedicate to follow the route of how the time she didn't appreciate that\nAnd just now unless it's written drew furloughs\nYes I thought that was left lane and his willingness to play monopoly and when you think this is the greatest variations of

David all student with the b._b._c. news President Trump has confirmed that the United states plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces treaties struck during the Cold War three decades ago the to the destruction of hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons speaking at a campaign rally in Nevada Mr Trump accused Russia of not owner and the code\nRussia has violated the agreement and they've been violating it for many years that I don't know why President Obama did for\nAll out we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement I go out and do weapons were not allowed to wear the ones that have said in there for him in Russia has not founded the agreement so we're going to terminate we're going to pull out\nRussia has previously

bridge having made makeshift places to sleep and being supported by aid agencies but hundreds decided they could no longer wait taking ... votes to cross the river into Mexico illegally\nTo that extent do think western governments ... perhaps too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine and uh\nWe're wrong to believe that he was a reformist you know if\nYou said with any of the very impressive individual when he talks about the future of the country and\nPrivatizing aramco and diversifying into other areas his willingness to take on the the most fundamental harvest and the country to do some progressive things that need to happen both for human rights and other reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch and he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what he did in ... and the way that it without communicating to other countries was no doubt a rookie mistake\nWhat he did and arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt was rookie mistake\nAnd in the order of this which it would appear that he may have done certainly this goes beyond rookie mistake\nAnd goes into the area being absolutely ruthless we know of what he did at the Ritz Carlton right detained\nOpposition folks shut them down torture some of them and so I think we just need to understand that hood as we're

know ... a big sort of scientists who can't get as many without really thinking why we ... we would want that means in London they ... they think ... standing they require\nAnd which of the many people who have been questioning the time and what struck has struck me I'm In the policy mountains is how willing people ... to ...\nAnd the hunting down some of the big reform and a great reforming

need to see what what would happen but I very much doubt that there would be a long term repercussions that would stop business uh between a Saudi Arabia and the west and it's important to make the distinction between west\nAnd the rest of the world because no one from China or Russia I'm off putting out there in fact looking and waiting for this for the west to vacate the scene with Saudi

money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this full point two billion a to lose ... pounds of of of five billion dollars worth of annual trade\n... at the trade but as as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi or we propose to give this up the

some of the midlife crisis leaving leaving that reliable\nAnd partner and gathering and finding that as a lays out the more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to ... come ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that is a global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is a different set of values\nThan we in the west operate on what though if more\nImages I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely\nGruesome would that change things\nWill murder is was gruesome regardless of how he takes face um and I think the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this in check 'em that's authorized

just have to wait for the results of the investigation bugs how does that how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course they pulled out when we knew what was happening in Yemen they will still gathering at very happily what what what do you think about that\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not the subject is operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of merit in the south is Red Sea all closed up Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us all\nGoes through there it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudi is actually the fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who will be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of fragile and complex to your political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not a Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremist and and and you you have and then you've got the oil um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will

kind of ... too many Saudis access provided us to come on comic because\nIt was the cost of them having access\nTo contact that she was as war [noise]\nAnd we think of a short time or the market

[noise]\nSarah I go um why was this documentary important in Nineteen Seventy three [noise]\nAn American family which some people listening may remember was twelve episodes in the life of the loud family who allowed those cameras in a that was the first shock but they allowed PBS\nAnd our cameras into their lives a for a solid year recording everything but but much more than had been revealed in the mainstream documentary before\nAnd people were shocked by you know to the late it fascinated also shocked by the documentary in certain ways which had very high viewership that the loud family in Santa Barbara allowed these cameras in that they allowed their dirty laundry to be aired before millions of viewers\nAnd that they then became instant celebrities out of it [laughter] interviewed on TALK shows offered speaking gigs a and so forth it seemed like a transformation in what the very contents of what's ... one's private life were and so\nThe genre because it was popular because it was debated widely in the press became\nPart of popular consciousness and the Nineteen seventies and again move the line between what people thought was public and what was private not everybody agreed that that the show was a good idea or that the loud should have gone before the cameras that they couldn't deny that there was a kind of alert to doing it right and that people want it to watch\nAnd look how shocking it is to us now that a family or the cameras are an individual to let cameras into their lives I mean like from the real housewives to you know the real world to uh the car data and like this is not surprising at All right\nYes yes and this was really American family is really the progenitor of most of those shows and the very fact that there's a kind of history of a shock or decreasing shock right or any ... is part of this story\nFor sure and it also speaks to this like underlying paradox with privacy which is that we want it and we really want to violate other people's privacy at the same yeah\nYes yes which suggest it has a certain kind of value to us right it has a commercial value it has a personal value\nAnd that it isn't it hasn't gone you know by any means it's where I really take issue with commentaries that said Americans don't care about it anymore they care about it a lot that they care about it in both ways it so valuable that they want to know what's going on in other people's private lives and that they want to keep other people out of there is\nSo speaking actually to that value of privacy and kind of the allure of knowing other people's secrets I'm In the Nineteen seventies there was a television personality named Phil Donahue who started\nA talk show that would go on to talk about all kinds of things that we talk about a pre sexual abuse a divorce people having money problems\nAnd the things I think once upon a time people would have thought were amazing that they were discussed on TV and that gave rise to a generation of shows in the eighties and nineties I'm Talking about these kinds of things up\nProbably the most successful one was hosted by Oprah Winfrey\nThis programming is Bronx you by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the flying detriment story of a quest for true love opens the season in the restored for them to bring nineteenth through November second Houston grand opera dot org\nWith uh the telephone people can listen in the calls and the telegraph and then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all over city that you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in\nLondon or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city\nWould know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously\nAnd maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like you could argue that we may have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago\n[noise] absolutely I think this is what is mischief in in our contemporary debates this idea that the privacy of some things some\nQuantity that was there once and is now gone and or eroding slipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways than did people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a rape house construction ways that neighborhood they're designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very right center sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so\nIt I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy\nIs all moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place at any given point but it's\nIt's the exact and in certain ways even though perhaps we have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information say um it's accessibility to others we have more privacy I think some ways in ways we live in a way as we think about ourselves as\nPrivate up people who are not to have the state or neighbors appearing in through our windows all the time\nSo what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\nYou have a gun control movement that has an equal and opposite level of volume and intensity at the grassroots level that you do for the gun rights movement now this might seem very counterintuitive to listeners because if you you know watch mainstream media there's obviously a liberal media bias\nYou also have public opinion of very much in favor of tighter\nGun reform laws you know the latest Quinnipiac polls have responded and saying you know at more than Ninety five percent saying they'd like\nTo have tighter gun laws so the public opinion and what citizens want is not in line with we're a public policies are going and that has directly attributable to\nThe phenomenal grassroots organizational prowess of the n._r._a. your list\nThe innovation hub I'm ... I'm Talking with Leslie ... field she's the executive director at Georgetown's global social enterprise initiative and the author of the book how change happens why some social movements exceed well others don't [noise]\nUh let's talk about one more social movement and this is a movement that you know has changed American culture and it's the movement towards gay marriage and this is one that has often been a lot of people have remarked on like how quickly public opinion changed if you go back to Nineteen Ninety six\nWhich was just over Twenty years ago not that long ago when you think about\nDecades and decades of you know tobacco use and right we think we have to enter a hundred and fifty years old so she's Twenty years ago we had a Democratic president Bill Clinton who signed the defense of Marriage Act which said marriage as between one man and and one woman when you think about\nThat wow how things have changed in a little over Twenty years um what is your take on how public opinion the Democratic party how did they change so quickly\n[noise] when you look at the strategies and tactics employed by advocates for\nGay marriage certainly trying to influence and shift public opinion in behavior was part of it but it really was a very holistic and strategically thought out campaign where there were policy changes there was litigation strategies and all kinds of things going on\nSo just to take you back to another moment in time\nBack in two thousand and five some of the leaders of the various groups involved with marriage equality or at a convening in Jersey City New Jersey\nAnd it was a real low point for the movement you know a lot of times people say now you know with demographic changes that it was inevitable that we would extend this equal rights\nMarriage equality not look inevitable\nIt looked impossible to leaders got together and they said you know what can we try and accomplish and they started to look at the country not as this monolithic federation of fifty states\nBut they developed what we call it ten ten ten twenty equal fifty lens ... it's a tongue twister but the ideas that you've had a kind of divided up the country and look at it regionally so they said let's take ten states and maybe it will try to go for full marriage\nYou know we did it in Massachusetts we're going to to try and defend that their let's go to New York let's go to some of the states with has\nA more progressive out mhm then we'll take ten states and we'll try and just go for civil unions you know for Vermont had introduced this innovation it's kind of separate and not quite equal but better than what\nMany gay couples out of the time then they said other states let's just go for a relationship recognition law so we can visit our partner if they're sick in the hospital but the interesting thing is twenty states the balance of the U. S. states the strategy was just to go take\nDiscriminatory laws off the books right sodomy laws all kinds of discriminatory laws it's still rested on um state and local book so\nIf you could get communities across the U.S to take kind of one incremental step forward towards greater tolerance maybe not embracing full marriage 'cause that was really big leap for for most people [noise] and then once they started saying what can we get done at each state and local level\nThen they started getting more momentum\nI Wonder is white um the people did who were trying to push towards marriage equality is that um something that other people have done like you know people who wanted to curb tobacco use did they think well\nYou may not get his foreign to back a growing states you know like in the southeast so maybe we'll focus a little bit less on those ... have you seen that done in other places\n[noise] absolutely all of a successful movements that we studied adopted ten ten ten twenty ... approach guy even if they didn't call it that I mean that that to a rubric that we borrowed from the playbook of the\nWinning marriage equality movement a documents even if not to the letter the spirit is whether your gun rights or drunk driving reduction\nCertainly tobacco control you saw this movement like if you think about the gun rights movement\nIt's always been a state and local strategy if you've ever wondered why you've never seen a big gun rights movement on Capitol Hill\nI haven't but yeah I Know what you mean there's no like march on the capital\nThere's no margin of error okay okay so they know that that's not how change happens change happens by marching and focusing your firepower on state capitals and at\nCity municipal levels and that's where they focus their resources and in fact for very long time really tried to stay away from any federal or Supreme Court ruling because there was nervousness among honorary leaders that\nIt would not be supportive of Second Amendment or right\nSo let's talk about social movements that you think as you kinda look for where here might be strengthening in their power we talked a little bit about gun control advocates in that vein is there anything else that strikes you I think about\nA lot about the me too movement with all that's going on in the headlines these days\nAnd certainly from a grassroots perspective as you have more women coming out and just exposing themselves to the scrutiny and the hatred that they often are up against on the side of transparency and saying this happened to him and there's a lot of strength in numbers\nYou know what's interesting about me too is that the challenges around gender equality sexual harassment sexual assault there isn't a policy or a law that can necessarily change things at this point if you think about it and most workplaces except for a few exceptions [noise]\nYou know sexual harassment sexual abuse is illegal right what you need to do is change social norms so if you think about one of the successful movements we've studied in her book the anti drunk driving movement led by mad mothers against drunk driving you know there is no policy or law\nThat says you have to have a designated driver\nBut because ...\nBoth tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around friends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually invented by a group in Canada but mad had the chapters in the local presence to be able to make that go viral you know decades before we had Internet and things that go instantly viral\nAnd it became the norm that if you're at a party and you see your friends had one too many you know let them back drunk you take their kids designated driver\nThat the social norm shift to behavior change so when you look at me too I think a lot of this is incumbent upon men in positions of power\nWho are the ones that can enforce their peers\nTo not engage and abusive um types of behaviors and for that movement thinking about what how do we actually shift the norm becomes\nApparent and then there's you know other things you can do as well like continuing to advocate and push for nondiscrimination laws having more women in positions of leadership and power\nIs the number one way to prevent these types of things from happening as well and you still have vast inequalities at that level\nMostly ... is the executive director at Georgetown University is global social enterprise initiative she's also the author of the book how change happens way some social movements succeed while others don't
