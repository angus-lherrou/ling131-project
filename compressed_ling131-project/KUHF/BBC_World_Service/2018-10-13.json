{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "But Nikki Haley's resigned kind of effective up before the midterms granted kind of unusual\nYeah yeah you know she'd pitch and herself as somebody who was able to kind of communicate to or inflammatory or in sometimes explosive boss the president on things like Russian sanctions the value of the UN just period and so these are things I think that definitely will show that\nThere's a gap that needs to be filled now Dana Powell who is a Goldman Sachs executive and former White House official is talked about as a possible replacement but there's some internal consternation about whether or not that's the right choice some and the administration like the national security adviser John Bolton want to go in a more hawkish directions but ultimately like you say\nThere were going to win the White House is creating serious complications\nAnd I pass awful brain and we'd be remiss without suggesting that the president floated a name out himself ... none other than his daughter a bongo [laughter] I didn't hear that yeah apparently he thinks that no one would be more qualified and it would make a finer ambassador the un than a bunker Trump laugh\nBut but all all jokes aside um I think the resignation of\nNikki Haley is interesting speculation about her potentially\nIn the sort of grand ... which are room where Jeff Sessions is who let go at the end of the midterms\nAre Lindsey Graham who suddenly become a\nPresident Trump's favorite United States senator to be allowed to strike yeah certainly the loudest becomes even turn the attorney general and Nikki Haley becomes the next senator from uh South Carolina or there was always Nikki twenty twenty\nIt's like a soap opera right to too many different sub plots hard to keep up right [laughter] well one thing that came up this week was the president has penned an op ed in USA Today\nBasically excoriated the Democratic party J what are some of the highlights for you\nOh man I were to start it bordered USA Today which is widely circulated national newspaper has been\nPretty roundly criticized for number one printing it I think\nHe set a record for the number of I Want to say misstatement really I'm In in in a in this it's interesting because it reads a lot like a policy paper that maybe Stephen Miller out of the White House or would have put out more reactionary reactionary and it was clear that USA Today was trying to cover its base has had a series of\nHyper links associated with the story that\nThat seemed to to call into question the veracity of the stories that it was it was a or at least the Trump op ed but a couple of quick highlights that caught my eye one\nThe cost estimates for Medicare for all programs comparing the Democratic party economic policies to Venezuela and socialism is talking about the Democrats as supporting open borders and so there was a lot of I think political red meat\nIt's unusual for a couple of reasons one this red like something that the president would give it a rally or a campaign stop right it's not the kind of sort of large scale general audience\nA document that you want to put out there that tries to sort of taken more muted approach in terms of a message so we just was really an odd for them for the kind of message he put\nOut yeah he implied here by sitting apply said directly that the truth is the centrist Democratic Party his dad I don't know what to make of that sense centrist and both parties have been declining for at least Twenty years so maybe that's true but it's true for both parties my initial reaction was flame on like this is\nJust a complete like an explosion of of talking points a kind of along the lines you said I think whoever wrote this had the there's the store is open to the page or that had the weren't radical on it so [laughter]\nYeah it's an unconventional choice of the president right to write something in USA Today\nMight take beyond just the kind of politics of it was the most civilized about health care and this is really where a lot of these fights are being held so in the down ballot races you don't see as much talk directly about Trump and his sort of influence on the office it's a lot about\nHealth care and Trump I think did a what Republicans of asking him to do which is really to have had on tackled the Medicaid Medicare for all issues so to me this is probably a signal that the party recognizes this is a problem and that the president knows that they've got to defend their ...\nThe polling data is pretty clear on this Medicare for all conceptually is incredibly popular we we know\nFrom from state by state polls and national polls\nMedicare is bipartisan popular it's interesting that he characterize it that the Democrats suggestion for Medicare for all was somehow killing Medicare which he has vowed to ... I mean brought these your pre existing conditions again that he says he wants to protect\n'em while simultaneously wanting to to essentially trying to end up ... program so it's an interesting piece\nBut I think it speaks to the potency of the political potency of\nHealthcare Democrats I think it would be wise to recognize\nThat what the president is trying to do is essentially sort of a not too late themselves from the on the issue of healthcare Democrats probably should be spending more time talking about health care and last time talking about Donald\nTrump yeah there was a reason that there was pushback on this I mean if this was just some average issue that the president put out it would be ignored by Democrats but Chuck Schumer writes the sort of most high ranking Democrat in the Senate was\nLike very pointed in this crisis and so that I think is definitely a signal that this is where much of the meat of the election will be about\nBut Jay not just the president is involved in politics now we have all kinds of people who have weighed in including your favorite Dale is with\nThe dry ... has entered the discussion she's telling people to shake it off\nAnd get out there and vote for the Democrats she came out and endorsed a bill Bratton send the former mayor of Nashville who's running for governor in a hotly contested race against congresswoman Marsha Blackburn kind of unusual she had not been very political before but now has been uh\nBeen urging her followers to get out there in support\nOf bill Brunson but what's interesting is voted out or she had she tweeted this out put it out on Instagram that that's her endorsements had seen a surge in voter registration so swift nation is responding and\nThey are coming out in force yeah you know a thousand I think was the increase they were they were estimating or they said that ... in Tennessee alone you've seen an influx of uh of participation in politics so it'll be interesting to see if if it actually does something\nRight you know what I'm not budging until I Know who the weekend to support okay that's my\nCanadian ... weekend is Canadian regardless\nI'm I'm waiting and waiting\nJustin Trudeau that's who we support\n[laughter] well this is I think good right more people being involved is always good there's no doubt but the claim that she was the cause of this increase in registration I think is probably spurious\nBut I'm Glad she did this because my examples I use in class for admitted very biased have been a little stale so this is perfect to be able to demonstrate that this is one factor of many the bows proximate probably was that the deadline was like the day she said it so I don't expect that this was tremendously influential but\nGetting young people involves important their numbers lag significantly behind where older voters were a vote and so that has to be remedied and this may be as one step in that direction\nBread it let's talk a little Texas politics and what's happening here in the Lone Star state our congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee a is embroiled in a bit of controversy a lot of controversy at currently her intern has been identified as the leaker in the ducks in case related to\nPrivate information up or the United states senators what's happened in how serious is\nThis is a pretty serious um yeah this individuals and charged with making public a or a dock saying as you say restrict information or authorized access of government computer burglary and other violations of federal law obviously this is not something you'd like to see happen in the context in which happened is very laments a ball but\nIt certainly shows that there is just hoping for now between the parties no holds barred I'm reminded actually something we saw this\nWeek we're Eric Holder the former attorney general said the following when the other side goes low we kick them playing on a ... Michelle Obama's line when they go low we go high I don't know how to remedy this except to say that an election year some possible to get people to see the kind of unity of\nThe country it's a lot of partisan bickering and this is talk [noise]\nYeah I mean just look personal there's got to be some some parameters here uh and and we're increasingly seeing this kind of\nPretty aggressive ... you know\nAnd in this case illegal activity going on back and forth we saw it as a kind of similar deal not too long ago where people were sending\nWhite powder to Ted Cruz's office people slashing signs of both parties there's a lot of anger and then the political process in it and this is an unfortunate thing um we should also take a step back in and hopefully in kind of dial down some of the rhetoric\nWill Brandon governor Abbott has come out with a position that is a little unusual for Republicans but he's you know\nHe is backing the decriminalization of marijuana this is kind of a big turning point Greg Abbott signing on with Mary Jane what's going on [laughter]\nYeah this is interesting you announce the policy we're suggesting he's open to dropping the maximum\nPunishment for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana from a hundred and eighty days in jail to find this in some ways mirrors what is happening locally not just here in Houston but also across the country where local governments like in law enforcement India is are not enforcing this anyway\nTed Cruz admitted in the first debate with a ... that he was\nThe Jay Leno that money is the mother's milk of politics and know cases that more true than in taxes in mid term and a competitive one at that so let's talk a little about what we saw with the last go round here of quarterly fundraising with what's\nWell we've got a lot of things your state wide is pretty much what we would have expected governor Abbott is considerably ahead of wealthy yes very wealthy got well over I think twenty six million cash on hand\nRaising money kind of left of hand over fist now and a little bit elders would be doing great if she was raising money\nAs a state rep candidate but she's raising money as the government for the governor of Texas office um and it's coming in I think that it was a poultry balance of three hundred and three thousand after raking in\nSix hundred and eighty thousand dollars lieutenant governor Dan Patrick is considerably ahead raising about one point six million to his opponent my call years\nThree hundred and Ninety six thousand the one race of note that will you and I talked about earlier said Miller is doing his ... to ... to sort of test the hypothesis that it doesn't matter what you do state wide as long as you have in our by your name you are going to win is\nHe is not raising much of anything from his opponent Kim Olsen\nTook in one hundred and thirty one thousand dollars which is not very much except shoot himself only took in twenty five thousand dollars and\nThat is unbelievably low for a statewide officeholder and it came from only Thirteen Thirteen donations brand and he is literally not even trying to raise money though\nAnd he still probably going to beat her by\nA few points yeah no she out raised him\nBetter than five to one that might be a record I mean the numbers are low but that might be a record for a challenger in Texas in like the media Tom so that's pretty impressive\nShe's running a good campaign but I think like you say it's difficult to be able to undo and unseat or an incumbent Republican and this isn't enough money to make that happen anyway\nNow you talked about the age erase and this is I think an interesting one address some Nelson raise a bunch of money to ... relatively good but less than than his opponent some\nWe also know that this includes a pretty big ad buy from Ken Paxton so he is not taking for granted the way the Miller is that\nHe's going to get reelected and we spend a lot of time talking about this last week on the pod so we know that this was going to be a competitive race and it seems now that like general packs and also her\nWhy shifting gears a bit if we look at some of the local races for the Texas Senate the three big Zora contested races are kind of two and the the Dallas Dallas Fort Worth area and the one down here in in the Houston area Centre county Britain in Cali\nBill is doing much better than her democratic opponent non Beverly Powell I'm a little over a million dollars to a little under half a million dollars that's the here's the kicker though Brandon she's raised in a bunch of money but the vast vast majority are coming from essentially three sources three big patch\nTexas but last year reform and the political ... which is the political arm of the big tort reform group\nEmpower Texans pac which is the hard conservative group and then Texans for fiscal responsibility which essentially a new pack that is affiliated with empower Texans empower Texans is all over the place there the primary gave her\nTo a lot of the state rep and state Senate races essentially trying to support\nThe leader of the Republican incumbents hold off a democratic challenge\nNot just support but really prop up because in every case that we see a really vulnerable Republican you see a splash of money from the power Texans and from the Texans\nPossibility now we should note that this money is not just coming from AIPAC with a bunch of people most of that money almost all that money is coming from Midland oil tycoon Tim done as well as the fairest brothers who are billionaires because the fracking boom so almost all that money is coming from like literally three people\nI Know it's so so three people are are simply trying to cut ... trying to decide who gets elected to some of the Senate seats they have these outside influences in in some of these some of these races the interesting thing to me is\nThe lack of resources provided sore from a normal the normal process of asking people for money and I'm raising money that way\nThis is really a\nFascinating thing and there's no real consequences to it because no one seems to push back on\nThat yeah you know Republicans continue to raise their democratic challengers at least in the last couple of\nWeeks like the ... of course like you say that almost all this money has financed by just a couple of people so if that continues going to be really tough for Democrats to get out unless they can find their own source of this money hand and left that happened until it happens or until the people begin to sort of pushback on this I think you're going to see Republicans with money advantage\nIn without you for this week party politics reported in the George VI here for for the city of Houston

off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was in Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know how the whole chairs actually worked so why information where the whole chairs provide to the fly\nSo in order to hear that out what I did was to record from the ... air on and I found that the timing\nOf singles bike with different when I recorded the hulk here near in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded\nWhile the health care with in a position that simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that if I can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of this like coming on their whole cheering her on\nBut it's also about what they're targeting as well no because they have that ability to kind of over at the same time but they're also quite quick than of getting

it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can immediately detect rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about the funding\nSo it's important for us because this research has shown away that complex aspects of an animal environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike\nSo this is how our brains initially represent information in the world trade single spikes anything on there on every side and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons Pfizer no different just seem to be here to study

how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for why so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same techniques to build our own bio inspired technologies\nUnder

sixteen thousand people have been vaccinated or in this outbreak and that also using experimental treatments or fifty four people have survived as since the beginning of this outbreak but the real difficulty\nIsn't that meant that is not it's just you know at this time last time that there's an outbreak in a conflict area or and they're the security situation is is very tense but that that the other issue is that there is a lot of community mistrust\n... mall but significant pockets as a community of people who are resisting 'em ... who are quite skeptical that the virus in their response and making ... is that that was very difficult that the ...\nYes because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly removed board is being attacked\n[noise] actually I you know this is it's quite common to have community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people it is a lot of people dying to obviously people that are very SCAD\nBut I think you know the specifics of tea with this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area where there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension at in in the community\nYou know just last week Asian people last month sorry ... people were killed in an attack by an armed group on in Danny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well and so people are very uh very SCAD an angry and there's been a lot of protest\nActually being banned yet at the moment I against rising and security and not the result of that it's making the response is very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day I I didn't them and\n... genes how teams have to stop for a few hours either because it's shooting out around the city oh because his protest and this is hampering that their response or the tracing his contacts with people who could be at risk I\nIt's it's making vaccination I still practice law and ... and making the burials ah the burials more logistical than that is really a key positive year better response ah because at the guy that virus that is that is very contagious\nI ... on on someone who has died and to the burials is ready I keep wanting to respond to this is why they've instilled the new security measures wet and he's at school it's all they double a full burial teams if if needed\nLouis divest our correspondents in the

talking about how easily this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course there's a lot of a local culture in local\nUh practices that involve quite close contact with a dead body and so in past outbreaks who've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial took a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well as as a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is the very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the contacts with those people and if any of them becoming infected you isolate them by just doing this isolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control but of course you can't do that or\nSunshine articles ease a method investor and wind power and other renewable\n... of ... and ... and ...

pain on an awful lot of pressure over the past two years as he is being detained and they've been trying to do all they can\nAnd although President Trump has said that there was no deal they're helping some reports in the U.S media suggesting that there was an attempt to have some kind of negotiations some kind of secret deal behind the scenes\nFormer Malaysian deputy prime minister and opposition to to Emma ... is facing the first test of his return to political life Mr ... who was ... this year after being jailed in twenty Fifteen is contesting a parliamentary election today Roger ... reports\n... this is absolutely shocking it it's maybe when you listen to some stories that takes a while before some crucial details ...\nThis this this action taken within turkey so this was where you would expect to be have the safety that the companies being at in Turkey and Saudi Arabia\nIs this like obviously within the at the come see that this was a state within the state um and so this this disappearance or murder or killing 'em has happened within a zone within a country where you would expect they the loss of that country to be applying\nAnd this is so brazen this disappearance at were saying that that at the wider world hasn't actually seen evidence but at the Washington Post which is a pretty reputable paper at for which I'm Mr ... had had written um has said that it's hard recordings which apparently were recorded on his watch\nWhich showed that he was killed 'em dismembered now I Know this is a horrible thing to be saying this certainly in the morning but it was this sort of audio is released and it will be\nAnd I think the world will be totally shocked because it's one thing to hear of a death\nIt's another to hear the protests will stop it comes to release not can see the Turks\nAnd are having to buy time because they know how powerful that material must be um ... that I think we'll have to make\nAnyone who's a progressive and support from human rights across the world have to take action to try to do something with that America and the United kingdom that have long as as your commentator said being quite type a critical up I support for this hour days\nWhat what we're told these recordings exist I I have to say we haven't heard them yet we we don't yet have proof the Saudi line is that they knew nothing about this but some\n... some of these recordings exist actually raises another interesting question and that is if they exist uh um you know there's a lot of evidence seemingly that they do want us will they gosh it suggests surely that someone spying inside an embassy\nUm yeah well it partly ah from what was he just said they believe that it was a a recordings I can buy the the guy's a month so so when he entered the embassy use of the sea suspicious of what might happen I'm In the\nUn and you know just to pick up on on what Leslie said and also the recall it is becoming increasingly shocking that may be that we've just had two\nCases like this back to back but but where rogue states seemingly can deploy killer squads into another country in the case of\nUm Saudi Arabia to send a hit squad apparently to to turkey or in the case of a President Putin or at least people close to him to send to agents to to poison people and so it's become an incredible because it doesn't seem as if the international community can then do anything about that\nQuestion quick question for both of you on this number going to turn to something else and that he's the President Trump has made it very clear he doesn't like walk crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is seemingly doing here but he's also very gain not to in any way undermine a one hundred and ten billion dollar contract\nFighter jets upon which as he puts the U.S jokes Japan's now is President Trump's pick to\nJoin us in the U.S simply speaking plainly about a subject which perhaps other international leaders are making noises about human rights abuses but actually if there are contracts excite you know which way in the end the going to come down\nI I'm not a big fan of President Trump what he did lose ... correctly you know the the western world is a deeply involved in receiving Saudi money for for arms to various deals of course they don't want to jeopardize that income\nLeslie yes that that's true um but I mean it's just curious just I mean six days ago Donald Trump was telling the world that Saudi Arabia wouldn't last two weeks in power affect American military support\n'em ... seeming to call in the country to pay more for its own defense ... he's been saying to other members of NATO So\nYes I mean there's there's there's a law and play here but I think I'm a ... those people who are activists will have to put the pressure on all ... sorts of newspapers in the u._k. um to us have already pulled out of the conference that was mentioned and that's not a massive thing but that that's that's a commitment by those papers to keep this issue alive\nLeslie we talked earlier about the whole issue of Scottish independence topic leading you'd be looking at ... countries and and you you think there are some lessons to load\nWell and ... our our nearest neighbor is apart from at our neighbors and within Britain are that the Nordic countries at with whom we had a lot in common people like myself my family come from the very north of uh Scotland and from New York in the islands which was actually owned by Norway until sixteen hundred\nAt ... far more recent late the Nordic countries hopping racing ahead and almost every league table that tedious lay of the top of everything whether it's a literacy\nHealth and wellbeing child wellbeing loan ... uh equality democracy and born dates GDP they're doing extremely well they're mostly small nations around five million people same population of Scotland\nAnd surely we can look across the water and not direction across the north sea and tried to see how we could be picking up on very per ad results for us in terms of health and wellbeing how could we do things better\nSo what do you think they are doing right that Scotland is doing wrong well [laughter]\nI briefly and they've got to equality in batted rights at the heart of their society and they have the smallest income gaps in the world they have the highest trust levels between citizens and government in the world uh\nThey've they've managed to put their resources into excellent services so that middle class people are not going off to buy private education of private health\nAnd they keep the solidarity within the system that keep people paying taxes and they pay high taxes for high quality services\nSome of that solidarity might they beginning to crumble ... and there are conservative governments and some of these countries and the Norwegians have such a massive the world's largest oil ... because they had they that the cleverness\nTo set aside the money coming in from oil and they don't actually use it and they're everyday life but of course ... people can make the calculation that there's probably millions of crude or for each individual Norwegian if they were to claim their own\nSo I'm up until ... there's been a remarkable\nPolitical support for keeping the Nordic model is it cold\nUm that would have to be something Scotland would look at that of course as it evolves government we don't have the power over taxes to make the big change is necessary to achieve dots redistribution of wealth that you have to have to have a a good sign and say\nOK we will have more on this late to list the we're we're going to go out to Alastair Ross who has the sports news\n[noise] ah how we're going to start with the world anti Doping Agency who were up in the dying

I always say that you can do and you'll Gary Julia bedroom or your kitchen\nAnd ... what what really came to my attention last year was\nA story about a guy who was self medicating self treats and you say Chevy infection so he was essentially injecting himself with some day in a in the hope is producing an antibody that would then kill him or at least control his his infection and I thought this is this this is crazy and you know it is this really happening [noise]\nAnd so we started to look around read around and and we thought all this definitely a a a radio series in in here\nI yeah I I've got a few questions off the bat how on earth cannot be possible\nIt's incredible what you can do to yourself self experimentation is totally acceptable and of course the the thing is we've had great strides in the area of genetic engineering so muggy find your own genome for example of muddy find that the genetic material as as life in general\nAnd so all of these things have become more accessible that very cheap so it means that in essence you can do pretty complicated experiments in your marriage or in your bedroom and there are people trying to pin put their own muscles to make themselves they get this is a technique that's been proven to work in animals\nAnd so if you've got this whole meal bend the people who were trying to do these experiments and advanced science outside the confines of the ...\nThis is all well and good but isn't it potentially incredibly dangerous\nPotentially dangerous to to the people who do it to them on the whole they generally find out the what's needed that than knowledgeable people they they know the risks but it's still doing things outside of the convention of no more regulation and so that has to be a risk\nAnd you're doing this these people aren't doing this at highland let me just give me an idea of the kinds of conditions you meant some mention muscles that but what what could you do to yourself\nWell anything that we could do in a lab in theory you could now too in in a in a a ... a well equipped\nA carriage will or basement to you all have so things like changing your muscle was was was the famous one but it's the chap who tried securities HIV will control these HIV with them production of an antibody using a piece of DNA the next experiments his guns changes to remove the cells from his body\nManipulate those cells genetic and he said that they lack the protein that the virus needs to get into the cell and then injecting them back into his body in again in the hope of controlling the infection so they can do very complicated things\nUh which we do and we see in clinical trials around the world but that because I Do now and themselves they don't have all the rigmarole of guns from ethical approval and another\nThing I'll hit on the left is a scientist so you actually sort of secretly quite pleased when people do this because that doing experiments that that would take you years\nI wouldn't say will please because obviously one of the the reasons that we have these regulations in place is to protect people because there are risks and you assess risk but it does raise the ... the discussion about whether or not regulation\nHas become incredibly inhibit tree to progress things to to use in humans so for example\nIf I were at the at the outset of the program some of the vaccines and not being used in in the boat as they had to be fast track through the regulation so that we could use them and I think it's it's this whole thing about housing now go to the point where it's hindering progress\n[noise] bio hacking you heard it here first and you have as you say you made a whole radio series about this which you can find on the BBC website Leslie ... tell me about capping hops\nIt's as if to jump in stories student at the animal yes it is it's grace hey well and and again looking at the door to expect across the world that she late and we did latitudes and lots of people have literally wouldn't ... to the weekend\nIt's most common actually in Norway they have the highest rate of thought in the world that you can tell\nThat there's a part one hot for every seven Norwegian so that's really one for family\nAnd it stretches right across the northern hemisphere Canada America all the Nordic said the Russians attacks the Germans\nAnd then down in the southern hemisphere that the New Zealand has a famous for their patches\nCome straight one country as a widowed latitude that doesn't have this tradition as Scotland so I've been doing a PHD for eight years at comparing Norway and Scotland hopped traditions partly because I was eccentric enough to have a ... and ... and myself with no electricity no running wash our\nWay out in the top of the hell's wasn't everybody is ... I loved it and I think actually far more people would get genuine relaxation\nUm if they could get away from physically get away from absolutely everything and not be seeking the chemical release of alcohol which is usually high people escape and\nI'm guessing the reason there's a different tradition in Scotland is land rights\nIt is and it's just so difficult to get a little\nAnd there's four hundred and thirty two uh interests are people who own half the private loan to Scotland ... might think well I don't know we saw a lot to south literal that's that's very very small Norway has tens of thousands perhaps even hundreds of thousands of lumps donors\nAnd so you can easily or buy a piece of lunch from a farmer okay\nOn one day I'm going to go to Scotland cycle around 'em stay in both is we will talk about another time because we now have to jump to another story not state elections which take place in Bavaria in Germany tomorrow this has been a stronghold for the conservative Christian social union but opinion polls suggest\nThat the right wing populist party will tell us if ... if they\nCould do very well if the CS use hold on a very it is we ... that could put so the pressure on its ally ... and ... who's been facing increasing pressure from the populist rise\nFor allowing close to a million refugees into Germany in twenty Fifteen some opinion polls even suggest that the AFC\nIs now the second most popular policy across Germany from Cisco Schreiber was a leading member of the after the on she know believes the party is a threat to a gym and democracy in must

a good feeling it was quite an interesting crude of persons at wasn't open conversation so I had a ... a good feeling at the beginning\nThe party the well up in the ... on healthy way and it was very dangerous to a party is situated now and now they are a pretty right wing ... pretty anti immigration\nBut you're saying it was actually different to the beginning really\nYes it was it's a big difference so diverse some persons at the beginning to was told a nationalistic stuff but they were just a little ... minority now day I read that the majority and they asked to absolutely power in the ...\nSo why was the policies that you found it so attractive to well I hate to use the word but racist\nI think ... um the cause of the the ... that the euro or should be replaced was a mock so that may be a signal to them that this is a nationalist party\nWhat was the final straw for you when did you decide to walk out\nThat was a terroristic attack at the ... plots in Berlin and I did yes exactly and I was in the Facebook groups and saw how to my colleagues aware happy about it because they said that this will give us more welders and stuff\nBecause this was a ... who's asylum

the longer I stayed in the ... the more I'm happy I was just as the ... and the more I had the feeling that I Can't do it any longer and that I have to go\nIt was only last year that you left in the position of ... we all know it was pretty well established by then why did you stay for so long\nSo for two years from two thousand Fifteen to twenty thousand Seventeen I was into a position in the party so I was trying to get these very radical members out of the party or at least out of the\nBoth sides sort of pains to emphasize the no military nature of the exercise NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg insists that he respects a longstanding policy of military neutrality\nBut there's been much turbulence in the western Balkans recently from allegations of Russian interference in Macedonia in Montenegro to the election of a subset protest to the presidency of Bosnia\nMr Stoltenberg says that means that makes sense for NATO to strengthen its cooperation with Serbia\nThe partnership which has become more important is the fact that we have seen some tendons is towards the returning to the very strong nationalistic rhetoric over the past and we have to avoid that and to avoid\nGoing back into will do so on and then on to not dissuade wars killing of civilians suffering on really really dangerous or the situation in the western Balkans\nI'm sure you've seen the graffiti on the rules about right when you have is still very strong feelings against nighttime what what can you do to to help change those feelings do thing\nI think we need to recognize that this is a different part of our history ... to forget about it but we should look to hold back\nBy his we should be able to look into the future on on the roof together and that's exactly what we're doing

refugee status and Canada accepted us as refugees so we traveled to Canada\nAnd returned to Lebanon for six formative years of my life [laughter] watching Lebanon rebuilt after the war was significant for me as a human as a woman as an artist and it has inspired me to use my voice to represent where I come from\nAnd I felt that I was this accidental ambassador of Mike on culture where I constantly had to explain we're not terrorists were not dangerous\nWe're not living in tents were not traveling on camels and all of the prejudice that I was faced with and you design something called the dignity Iraq yeah tell me about that\nSo the dignity key is molded out of the key of my own home having traveled everywhere and feeling a little bit like a nomad myself and I was inspired by the Palestinian tradition of wearing your key around your neck\nThey came to Lebanon in the millions\nAnd they left their homes behind and I wanted to use that symbol to empower refugees and to change the narrative because when we see images of refugees in the media it's never dignified\n... speaking to the BBC ... civilians designs are featured in the exhibition contemporary Muslim functions on

this week without being aware of the massive report or keeping global warming down to one point five degrees just half a degree beyond what we've already reached\nIts report that talks about the compromising the economy about renewable energy electric cars even capturing CEO to from the atmosphere one headline from oil company ... massive read for a station\nThat point the report was into the territory of agriculture the business of feeding the seven billion and rising mouse on our planet itself a major source of greenhouse gases\nSo appropriate a second report appeared in makeshift shortly afterwards headlined options for keeping the food system within environmental limits\nExamining not just the climate but ooh the ecological impacts of farming lead off a marker spring when came into the studio and told me the pointless to see where sustainability me food security\nEnvironment in health I really two of the fundamental pillows that determine welfare broadly defined so we started from the point that we have to be able to feed a growing population in the future a healthy diet without wrecking the environment so therefore we looked at both\nHealthy dietary patterns and ways to limit the environmental impact of the food system\nAnd you then break the impact status of five category so I think the principal water which is the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide was all but as a whole range of aspects that you're looking at\nYou have what we know is that the food system really has tremendous impact on the environment on the range of different issues you named greenhouse gas emissions but it also occupies about forty percent of the earth land surface it extracts Seventy percent\nOf global fresh water resources and over application of ... this has already led to dead zones and oceans where you don't have oxygen anymore and fish died\nSo he's always fertilizers or things like large traits which are manufactured in big factories and then put from ... fields\nThat we looked at nitrogen and phosphorus application those are the two big chemicals that are also responsible for aquatic pollution Monday run off the field\nBecause that comes to the second step in your face this idea of a pilot treat boundary they seem to be said is a concept to me\nYet there are a little bit vague so they're intended to describe a safe operating space for humanity so if we don't see them then we're sort of find where at conditions that we know we can operate with\nAnd the idea is if you're a seat them then you run the risk that something goes have except to say so to give you an example for climate change would be if we pass a certain limited for example one point five degree bombing or two degree warming then we have a higher occurrence of extreme weather events drought flooding and so on\nFor phosphorus and nitrogen we might have excessive pollution of water systems with more occurrences of those dead zones and also with the other ones I mean you would interfere with ecosystems ... or to global hedge logical cycle\nAnd your analysis applies to now and twenty fifty so simple question oddly already operating beyond the Planetree boundaries in that sense\nYes we have we know that we have already emitted quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so the climate change boundaries really at risk of being crossed and we also know we uh in several regions applying to much fertilizers so those two things already into dangerous soon so to say\n... to go back to the feed security if we're already over ... marks are you looking at some areas by which we couldn't go on feeding a bigger population while reducing this impacts\nYeah absolutely or at least not increasing them right I mean for fertilizer application we need to reduce for greenhouse gas emissions we need to reduce but there are several things at our disposal booth which we can do that I mean we know that some regions really over fertilized they don't need to fertilize that much to crops will grow with a bit less fertilizer is well\nSame with a bit less water use so a big part of this whole scenario exercise is really\nWhat needs to be done globally and in different regions so if we were to let's say rebalance the application of fertilizers from over a plane reaches to end up buying regions then we wouldn't have a net increase but more food available for people\nI mean it sounds hopeful but on the other hand if people are applying to much fertilizer even now suggests that you're dealing with people who are making very good decisions\nThe thing is they don't have good tools at their disposal either so we know if you really properly money into how much you apply to feels and if you know how much your crops need then you can really be a balance that much better and some countries mostly in high income countries have those technologies and they don't over fertilized to that degree\nSo it's really a question of how can you make available those best available management practices to a growing number of regions predominantly low income regions\nOf the production and the other one which we often talking about here on the will surveys is about the ... the change of diet this I think the important pressure and all of this as the will become stricter\nYeah exactly we know that once people have more money they usually spend it on so called higher value foods and among those are meat products but also fruits and vegetables but processed foods\nAnd we know that isn't very good for your health nor is it very good for the environment because many animal source foods have a high impact on the environment and just because they're so inefficient converters of feet into calories that we eat\nYourself semester I was expecting you to come in and sort of be do B and gloomy and you seem to see a lot of hope it all the face another ... to this is as a huge amounts of starvation even ... even with the scene efficient system\nYeah that's right we know though that we could already now feeds the current population much more healthy leave without all that stuff ... so a problem is really inequality in the food system so high income countries consume too much income countries consume too little and almost everybody consumes the wrong stuff\nSo if we were there to visit gay realign the food system and really clearly communicate\nWhat is a healthy diet then I think we would be in a better place this is the weeks that the ...\nSee see the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has come out with their special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably facts you didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change\nWe know if that were not to happen then for example record expect reduction in yields yet other changes in the eyes of people that might make them on healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring than from the opposite marching program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere I don't think really sauce making a cool to have well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power suggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent and the and\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power has always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get them but that's not quite the argument from a a\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence of that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important\nWhat matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind ... might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you didn't get a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nThat article so as far as the researchers are concerned you know until they told they can't do something they'll do it\nBluntly put that scientists will still be on through your cools down meet up we've linked to tell me things will just reporting on our Web page at BBC World service dot com\nAnd finally drug testing but not with blood or urine samples with a

whether the smoke 'til injected or whatever they're metabolized by the body and then they have to ... and they typically are excrete today in urine and so when you hear of drug testing for the

that there is all the metabolites oldies truck recipes that are excrete it in the sweat and were able to detect bombs\nSo it's just really a question of analyzing whatever's in that sweaty book ... ... that's a simple prices as they are I mean it's presumably wants to be simpler than doing it with your life is\nIt's very simple site for our detection method we use cartridge that is very similar

is sufficient sweat on the fingers of deceased people and the sweat was sufficient so that we could detect whether\nThey had died of an overdose of a particular drug will sort of drugs you talk about we're looking at four different classes of drugs so kind of this group of trucks amphetamines opiates which includes morphine and the pain relieving trucks and ...\nIn these instances with ... says these are people who have died how long have they been dead for a ... a pretty grim question how good would the fingerprints that you were getting from them compared to people who are alive\nThe whole study that we have done was conducted by three different more trees in the u._k. we wanted it completely anonymous we didn't know how long these people have been taken some being\nDead very recently others not so and it was completely randomized so that we just didn't know how long people being in the ...\nBut how ... said was the test almost I mean with their variations or they always good\nIt was always good remarkably clearly if a person had died and was in the water for a long period of time than the buddy would decomposed very much more rapidly than had they been in control conditions in the military\nAnd if you will to do this presumably there is a desire for a very simple way of doing these tests with people who've died\nSo at the moment to be able to establish the cause of death a full ... investigation has to happen\nThey're very expensive four to six hundred pounds per person and this is a very simple way of establishing whether there's intelligence that the person has died of an overdose to establish whether that's the case will know\nIt is used as a kind of a screening device where you then say okay we're going to do a more detailed analysis old kind of get sort of corn detective information out that this person must have had so much ... for example so much drug before they died\nIt is a screen so we're looking to see if there's the presence of that truck is damaging the body and then the talks collage a cool roof you can establish the exact concentrations and\nIn that case of false positives and issued a false positives even\nYou always have to worry about false positives false negatives we've established that the accuracy of this is very high so we're comparing results with the ... data from blood analyses were of a Ninety percent thrilled focus

mountainsides away\nAnd that coupled with climate change when when climate change happened a drought effects that cleared land creates big cracks in the land\nAnd then when we see the opposite of that when we see heavy rain we're now into monsoons soon season rain falls into those cracks in the land in the in the mountainside and that's what is leading to more and more landslides every year is now
