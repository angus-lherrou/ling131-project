[noise]\nIt is you're in the middle of the creation of ... legacy seasons three now wherever you see we create prototype ... mail them out\nAnd we ask people to sit down and record themselves so right now we're waiting for our late ... playing a video to sit down and watch our on our plate custody of\nAnd I have to cook a lot of rewards for myself for example but I make it through an hour to the right one it would take a shower or go to Germany to\nGo get through that video somebody told me about your family your background I grew up in the mid west or in any way my dad no very a big part of my uh exposure to board games and I was a kid so what games did you play\nWhenever they get a lot of really dreadful games or early on like Kevin standard bearer monopoly clue and a strict ego and what not one of the stuff that my grandmother had around her farm house they kept all the games there in this giant said\nSee criminal hid the games away uh my mom\nWas going to get in in order to keep the games and some of the border they were kept in a closet called the states they bought that they can [laughter] that was not my memory and then we\nAnd we go in there and that's about what\nCan you paint me a picture of getting in there for the first time [laughter]\nWhether that was that you know about a dozen games in there and uh we pull out of a game of risk we wouldn't know what we're doing we're just going to step up and in our way through\nYou mentioned that the gangs will rule ... disorder Staci became ... the way that he approached playing these games ... Europe to find them changing them\nYeah I mean uh when I play the ones that the farm out it was a matter of just trying to cobble together no rules that we could have any kind of experience but I got a lot of games at presence and I remember the excitement of opening up the box\nAnd just the thrill of that thing and fresh new product and you sit down and play it and often it was just dreadful I remember the claim was that was mostly based on space invaders\nWell my uncle is pretty instrumental in this I almost fresh memories of working on that particular game with him\nFlipping over the uh the game of the game called debater and it had a little star ships and and things that look very upsetting to play with so we flip that poured over and we spread into the greatest stars on it and a critic sim cards and browse and poker chips and tried to make again about mining asteroids\nAnd contributed ideas but he was he was an artist and very much into making things and that was kind of contagious\nLooking back who's the creation of the game and the plane [laughter]\nOh yeah very much though it was a that was the main thing was the fun of it does it totally crash or does it does it work that little cycle they're like create something and then and poke at it and see you know I was in each one coming out with but it's pretty engaging\nRight well I think that's I think I'm coming up to my time limit on this line amendments what did you say would be a great time for me to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nAh let's see we've got to be mentioned on ... on August a as a three years we've actually brought a variation this product to such an common interests with people in the evening [noise]\nI find most we can learn about way he was in the creation of print that make light of the season three you can smoke find video sort of cross the last\n... cells I think he ruined village showers war has been happening since then\nRally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developed so it's like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better start the it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better and I certainly will be a story said that the timescale of the year that's right so you came into a month\nSo it's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforced and ending\nSemi they pull with tens of thousands of people and it will clays and some railway will begin what happens tonight tonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that serves\nIn a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing three seasons three and I'll be watching it with a notepad in hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience works how their first games were\nAnd have you done that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm at night it's going to be to ... for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter\nAs people I Do not know I've never met\nGet a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like an old tire evil oh I Know I don't think that's what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect but I get such rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be a fly in the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nThis illness the scientific discipline that you don't want to affect the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really stuck I don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the home from the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world dot V. I came on ... on the late to legacy versions of pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us as\nThe steam is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book and we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly floppy or how to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguage from other countries filtering back in the game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing game is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In the Studio", "city": "Houston", "day": "10"}
