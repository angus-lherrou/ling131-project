H. N. L. D. bet incorporated\nThey were a water conditioning from so they were purifying water for city drinking water in Philadelphia and other uh manufacturing processes\nThe royalty was usually made with London City water which came from the Thames and the Philly chemists we're confident that they could manufacture or recreate that water in the U.S\nThey sent a letter to the White House Eleanor Roosevelt specifically told them that they believe that they could accomplish this and wondered if they would be interested in receiving such a sample of sympathetically manufactured London and water\nThe science history Institute has the archives of the ... company and they contain the return letter from the first lady\nThe first one is is simply a letter from Eleanor Roosevelt to Mr Ross up at the firm's\nVets like damage to Ross you were very kind to offer ... and ... and ... as a product of your laboratory I accept your offer with gratitude very sincerely yours Eleanor Roosevelt\nSo the ... chemists requested a water sample from London they analyzed it\nAfter conducting a series of analytical tests on the water there were able to discover all the components of that water all the different minerals that were contained in that water and the proportions of those minerals within the water\nThey went to the Google river in Philadelphia and got some water from their\nDistilled it and then added minerals in the same exact proportions as London water they sent their sample to the White House and received in order to produce several ballots which they delivered a few weeks later the first lady expressed her gratitude\nFinally this last letters dated unites Nineteen thirty nine this is after after the king and queen had already left Eleanor Roosevelt right now my ... year Mr\nI'm writing to express my thanks feels that the specially advocated warfare which Mr Ross delivered especially for argues going to visit the kings and queens [noise]\nHe was very kind to take so much trouble to duplicate the land and sea water\nAnd tested site to lessen such generous punches and I want you to know how much stuff it's just a free skate it very sincerely or Eleanor Roosevelt\n[noise]\nWe don't know how much the royals enjoyed the tea itself or if they notice all of this effort but we do like to think that science was a key ingredients in supporting to close [noise]\n\nWe started out this episode studying food labels with chemists Katie hunt and she says from sugar to milk to methods sulfate everything around us is chemicals and she says rather than getting freaked out by their long and sometimes complicated names we should get to know them\nI sometimes think of of chemicals as\nPeople because they're all kinds of people and most people are really wonderful\nAnd some you really have to struggle to get to know and I think that's really how it is with chemicals and this effort could really pay off when you when you ask me about reading these these labels I started thinking yeah there's so much we don't get about what's in our food\nAnd and what it does to our bodies and how we can be really good to ourselves by really reading labels and understanding what they mean and how we can use that to our better health\n[noise]\nThat's our chauffeur this week the pulses a production of WHYY in Philadelphia and our health and science reporters are Alan Hughes endless tug Julian Harris is our inter Charlie ... is our engineer\nAlec stern is our associate producer time the English our editorial director I might ... thank you for this thing [noise]\nBehavioral health reporting on the phone is supported by the time is scattered good behavioral health down ... an organization that is committed to thinking doing and supporting innovative approaches to an integrated health care\nWHYY health and science reporting is supported by a generous grant from public health management corporation for public health fund ph MC gladly supports WHYY and its commitment to the production of services that improve our quality of life\nHouston Public media it's the service of the University of Houston and supported with your gifts to the Houston Public media foundation more information at Houston Public media dot org slash donate\nTest pilots to those assigned to diffuse potential bombs they are among those who do some of the most dangerous work imagine a better job has its ups and downs but they do get a view of a Lone Star state view of his ever will\nCommentator W. have strong takes us to the top of the structures in Texas vicariously goes next Texas standards [noise]\nTexas standards tomorrow ten am on news eighty eight seven Houston Public media [noise]\nThis is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty seven K.

using shape episode hacking the law first this news\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ... beer\nSecretary of state Mike palm peyote travels from Saudi Arabia to turkey as he pushes for a full

house of representatives NPR's Peter Overby says the numbers tell the story and third quarter reports just filed at the federal election commission\nIn sixty two races that will determine the house majority Democrats have consistently and dramatically outraged Republicans last quarter the Democrats collected a hundred and forty million dollars for Republicans fifty one million\nA couple of specifics outside Austin, Texas Democrat and Jay Hagar raised one point nine million compared to not quite six hundred thousand for a long time Republican incumbent Jon Carter\nSome races are closer than that in Wisconsin district it's been represented by house Speaker Paul Ryan Democrat Randy Bryce pulled in one point four million or Republican Brian style wasn't far behind it just over a million as for the polls the races are generally tighter\nPeter Overby NPR News Washington [noise]\nCuban diplomats and their supporters disrupting\nThe un meeting called by the U.S to spotlight the islands treatment of political prisoners protesters loudly banging tables and shouting and Spanish to be asked us blockade no\nThe protesters rounded out us stepping in Bastrop Kelly curry senior Trump of British ration officials or the secretary general of the American organization of American states above the noise in the U.S chamber was where protests by accredited diplomat to have a right to attend any open un meeting\nSue you we just got to work you started to raise money we did so we we pitched the idea for very long time and um had a very hard time getting anybody to 'em and give us any donations for the ...\nAnd then I met Jason forum and his father Joe ... and they had a Family Foundation and they were courageous enough to be our very first donors and they gave us a donation of a hundred thousand dollars to start the Bronx freedom fund\nAnd we began to pay people fail with that fund and what we learned is the revolving nature of the ... is that a dollar that you use in a year can be used two or three times because of the end of a criminal case the bill comes back into the fund\nA I Would be bold enough to say that some of those dollars that the farm family gave us way back when it's probably still operating in the Bronx today\nSo when when when somebody post bail and they go to trial and their case is dismissed that bill money's returned\nTo bail money gets returned regardless of the case how come\nI'm at the point of bail is to ensure that people come back to court so somebody comes back to court for each and every court appearance at the end of the case whether it was a guilty plea whether it was a conviction or whether it was a complete a quid alert dismissal the bail money comes back so it can revolve over and over again if you create a fund so\nHow does it work I mean you you have ... teams of people who would go to jail and say don't plead guilty we can help push bail for you and is that how it works\nSo the most important work gets done by our local people on the ground we called bailed is raptors many of them have been formerly incarcerated are impacted by the criminal legal system themselves they work on the ground to interview people in jails\nAnd what we've learned from the Bronx ... all you need to ensure that people come back to court\nIs effective ways to notify them about the next court dates and to provide some support systems while they're out of jail and connect into services that might exist in the community so when problems come up to prevent coming back to court we can help them solve that problem\n\nOver the past ten years may have been paying they'll lower and residents of New York city and what we have learned how to load at our ideas of why people come back to court and how the criminal legal system itself is operate it\nMoney isn't what makes people come back to court\nWe know this because when the ... and pay the bail Ninety six percent of fires for trying for every quarter parents it's how awful evidence\nThat we don't need cash or ankle bracelet or unnecessary systems of surveillance of supervision we simply need court reminders about ... to come back to court\nNext we learned that if they're held in jail on a misdemeanor Ninety percent of people will plead guilty but when the fund pay the bail over half the cases are just Smith\nIn the entire history of the ... view is that a two percent of our clients have ever received a jail sentence has any [noise]\nUm\nIt sounds like over the course of your career and you sort of comes with inclusion that the system these massive reform would that may be\nA decades long struggle and in the meantime one way to attack it is by attacking Baylor's by dealing with the bail issue yeah the way I like to think about it is this while we're thinking through ways offer systemic reform to happen while litigators litigation cases wild policy reformers are doing their work\nPeople sitting in jail self today they need a lifeline we can't ask them to sit\nIn those cold concrete jail cells while we talk about systemic reform it takes too long so when we think about revolving bell funds when we think about the ... project or the Bronx freedom fund or the community bail funds that does is around this country\nThat has an immediate lifeline to those folks sitting in jail cells as we hope to continue to Nate and moved systemic reform forward\nI think about like ... you know examples of criminal justice or injustice in America you know like vigilante justice or the way people behave in the wild west and we thank God you know one uncivilized time like we think we're we're just so much more involved than in civilized and the way that we deal with this now but\nBut we're not so we're kidding ourselves um and I know that that is very hard for all of us to grapple with because all of us are\nImplicated in what has become our criminal legal system um you know we seem to have in this country an insatiable appetite for incarceration\nAh we seemed to have in this country\nVery harsh mentality around punishment to we have views are criminal legal system to solve social problems that we used to look at as all of our responsibilities and instead we have pushed it away from our consciousness\nAs if it didn't implicate all of us but of course\nThat's Robin Steinberg in November of two thousand Seventeen

ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen lies that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\n[noise] like to have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nAnd so OR Books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great apes that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nThe person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men or actually\nFreeman were persons but\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed\nSo it can you explain how that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps or broadening the definition of legal person to include animals that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer I\nUm so my ideal democracy is one where the considered will of the people he's taken into account and I think elections don't achieve those ideals\nSo in your view art elections just fundamentally anti democratic\nIs fundamentally flawed in the way the practice now\n... they favor or elites and they have uh money interests famous thinkers for centuries equated elections with aristocracy and all the ... ah so I'm putting myself within these group of people and saying you know I think elections actually fundamentally flawed\nAnd whether we can I've come across as I think there's basically two responses that we can take the money has to go down the populist cause the fascist roots and the other is to try to find mechanisms and modes to do democracy better differently\nThan the exact mechanism for fixing democracy that Brett has in mind well it's pretty radical here's bread headache on the head stage\nSo I'm going to ask you two questions I Want you to put your hands up if you agree the first question is who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing [noise] the second question is who thinks at democracies a functioning while governor must be one politician in the audience some way\nNot but my point is there is a massive paradox of contradiction here\nI think there's two ways to resolve this paradox\nOne is to give up on democracy the other option I think is to fix this broken system\nWhich brings me to my ... my ... month it's technical name is so tuition but it's common name is random selection and the id is actually very simple randomly select people and put them in parliament\nWeight\nYou know you want to just put random people into a into a legislative body and say here you go figure figure it out is that is that more or less what you're saying\nUm this seemingly are absurd idea is actually based\nOn hundreds of experiments worldwide where this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected nonchalant people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things are vixen parliaments\nThe Ninety nine randomly selected sample of people went through\nWe cans of deliberation informed by experts with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was then put to a referendum on about two thirds of the Irish people agreed with them\nIf these people are so good at is why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of ... get made and who understand the consequences like that's what I Want so how does a random democracy you know solve this problem\nElections don't produce experts this is a complete fallacy otherwise we would elect our brain surgeons um yeah elections produce people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to inspire people with ridiculous tweets I don't I'm not sure\nBut it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy at making so I Would actually argue that's a random representative sample with good processed informed by experts who've costs or don't have power they just have the power to give information\nUm would result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through an induction process where they live about how the system guys will how low making has made it such a the other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is\nExactly what authoritarian regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of ... says oh yeah I think it's it's a you open yourself up to the accusations of ... which is sad that we should actually handed over to a take no procedural suddenly\nWell it's interesting like let me see if I understand it correctly\nIn a system that you think would would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate the lectures yes right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you would have some kind of system a lottery or a lottery whatever it is what people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and say hey you know you're going to be represented for the next two years and\nThat that's how you would you like that's how I Do a there's a lot of protests questions around there but the key thing is that it works when people would do this [noise] people make trusted balance decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase in trust in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my\n... and we come back and just a moment red headache describes how he invests\nAnd this randomly selecting leaders on the show today hacking the law

we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of a elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntary once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random section of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people I'm not I'm Sorry I'm just like his guts of the galaxy going out Douglas Adams ducked with settlers and it's just I just got by Douglas Adams saying\nAre the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably want to see it\nStopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a one like the chamber in one solution chamber once with fish and buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for change but ah but this is a path to old is the ideal", "show_name": "Tell Me More (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
