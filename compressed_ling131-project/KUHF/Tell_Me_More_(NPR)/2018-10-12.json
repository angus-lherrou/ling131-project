I mean with the variations or they always good\nIt was always good remarkably clearly if a person had died and was in the water for a long period of time then buddy would decompose very much more rapidly than have they been in control conditions in Moultrie\nAnd if you will to do this presumably there is a desire for very simple way of doing these tests with people who've died\nSo at the moment to be able to establish the cause of death a full ... investigation has to happen\nThat very expensive four to six hundred pounds per person and this is a very simple way of establishing whether there's intelligence that person has died of an overdose to establish whether that's the case will know\nIt is used as a kind of a screening device where you then say okay we're going to do a more detailed analysis old kind of get sort of quantitative information out that this person must have had so much ... for example so much drug before they died\nIt is a screen so we're looking to see if there's the presence of that truck is there in the body and then the toxic logical rip you can establish the exact concentrations and\nIn that case of false positives and issue or that false positives even\nYou always have to worry about false positives false negatives we've established that the accuracy of this is very high so we're comparing results with the toxic logical data from blood analyses were of a Ninety percent thrilled focus drunks up to Ninety nine percent in some instances\nOne floor and all of this are you looking for stuff which is on the fingerprint which you think is being wasted but presumably as I Walk around the building I can pick up the cause of contaminants and that may give a full story about how I pay ... a drug metabolizing\nYou're absolutely right for a live person clearly the easiest ways to wash your hands\nDr ...

never felt burden I never felt resentful of the association or that it was limiting the in some way or that it I Want in some of that time back I just felt like I had been part of something where I got to play a character who was\nComplicated and flawed and night and I loved figuring her her out and I got to live this alternate in somewhat like at a an alternate universe I spending more time

I since I don't know a whole conversation wheelchair and Oregon on the shoulder in London a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with him\nSo it's a lot of guilt and and wondered if I should have done some things differently but now\nYou're older and I see your work and I see that there's a lot of young people who are are getting a lot out of it and and it's she's like I have to say like I wouldn't take it back because I see who you've turned into and what you've done with it and I think it's a\nI think you're you're helping some kids out there\nAnd you can imagine that was a very emotional experience for me to read that\nAs far as I go though\nYeah I'd probably change they could go back and not have to deal with some of the stuff I doubt it for sure but my mom had that perspective on it which was both nice to read and also very intense very heartbreaking me personally if I could go back to Nineteen Ninety One Ninety Ninety two and just flip a switch and not have to deal they're probably probably\n\nYou're listening to ...

I'm definitely a workaholic its problems it's probably like one of the biggest things is still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go tomorrow which could\nGetting better about that you know have a little bit for stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nI have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... cop to the fact of like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that ask at New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member Knesset now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent for the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get\nWith my next gig ... might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy you're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause he's proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do 'cause getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems\nAs far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say some of the stuff I've done\nI don't know like I mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show generate shows more funding if in that show than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course\nBut it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know they have their mission statement of trying to like break the system sneak in the back to", "show_name": "Tell Me More (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
