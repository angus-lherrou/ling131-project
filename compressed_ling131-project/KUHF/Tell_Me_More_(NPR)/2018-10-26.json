Richards\nAbsolutely so it seems that invasions of the other parts of the ocean is heavily dependent on the sort of traits the sort of foreigners that they take out in the shallow environments so it's really only those fishes that happened to become streamlined and flexible and more active swimmers that then later tried to invade the reefs in the open ocean\nThe truth of it as that fishes actually move into freshwater first which I don't think anybody would have expected\nThat is very interesting so the fact that you know to ... and the fish the front ... to be fish that social just started coming up on the beach or something like they were to do that kind of expression from the beginning\nYes it does seem that way and it's another good analogy because it's the same situation where you have traits that show up in some shallow water environment like limbs and lungs\nOr the other traits have Petro pods which are land animals and then that's being used to move into a new environment but without any further incredible change until much later\nLower and solemn who study appeared today in songs and if you'd like to go back to another one or two hundred million years ... must be Kobe's investigating the origins of all I moved on discovery next week more than ... ... am tomorrow everything in the program on our Web page at BBC will social comb\nNot to mention port costs of our past programs a whole ocean songs and we should start to throw you in a fish\nWill on ... so to mix week for song too much and good by for me run peace but he's a funeral but\nThere is an oil boom in ...

[noise] um\nWhen you write a memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing ... was added difficult part of writing the book\nIt was it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write this story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens where does he go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed\nA night stickler Robin I hadn't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I've known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was\nSo that was sort of hard to do but that was the that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into it and what it needs what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is a lot of folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know we've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise]\nUm yeah how ... how do you feel differently about they're passing as I say you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\n\nYou lived in the United states like ten years yeah what do you think about when you think about England like what are the things that you've maybe even surprised herself reminiscing about\nWell my happiest memories that I look back on tend to be based on sports [laughter] so um I'll think about playing football really\nYou were like a pretty serious football player a soccer player yeah yeah when you were a cat right\nYeah that was the number one thing for me\nHow much time did you plan to spend playing so\nLunch times or school or after school sometimes before school with training and then uh the ... depending on what teams I was going to be matches on Saturdays\nAnd Sundays once I joined a an additional team and then there'll be trains on most mornings also says a fair amount of time [laughter] um\nI mean I'll say present tense too because I still do but I'm a very good football player [laughter] you know there's only a couple of things that I Would ever talk a\nConfidently [laughter] about myself in you know and and football is one of the things that may be only two\nAre dependent on the day three things but usually two things in the wild about the I'm actively be confident in [laughter] but one of them is\nThe second widest what words with friends\n[laughter] you know what I Am good at that actually um [noise] no they are playing guitar [laughter] okay\n[laughter] that's fair you're listening to ...
