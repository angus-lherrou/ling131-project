improvement was more than for the assignments ones were you surprised\nThat well not really be goes outside matter we know that it's a really really bad form of dementia that affects the old brain so we were in a way kind of expecting\nThese kind of results a more you think it is about listening to someone reading aloud that's making a difference because it does seem extraordinary in a way that this could make a difference to memory well\nNot really because when you are actually listening to her story you're actually during the hearing some of your memories in order to feel the holes that are in the story so let's let's do a little experiment before I started reading\nYou of someone waiting for his luggage you might visualize in your mind song I don't know maybe get the ...\nOh yes or no stretch away I was thinking of an apple and I'm thinking of white thing and that they can that hasn't even started yet\nThat that what I mean so your brain works with some groups and those groups you build these groups on the basis of your own memory basically it's back and forwards\nKind of process so the story gives you some and but you feel these weeds your own memories so it's not really surprising actually\nAnd the people seem interested in the stories that they were being read to people discuss them together\nYes obviously I mean you're not allowed so there's a lot of variables coming in in in the experimentation but I can see it at all those variables are actually three grids by the reading because you have something on which you can discuss with the others\nSo it might be that it's about\nHow narrative affects your brain and also the situation that comes up\nIn this kind of training Odysseus\nI'm with the kinds of differences that you saw in memory how important to all those all the difference is big enough to allow people with dementia to do something that hadn't been able to do for all to take power more in conversations\nAre well I don't know but let's say that you've before the who didn't actually remember\nAt least of Maine's after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit of improvement but the main improvement for me it's about out to be a good article memory\nSo once they start to to have a better memory and the ... for months using memory they started to that allows their own stories which is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least\nReaching a point in which you got to remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo what do you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these upbringing in many many different situation because it's a strong training it's a really good training and it was really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and everybody almost everybody we have a book in our house and someone who read to you\n... ... this was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this is enough to slow down the process at the mentors that but it's it's really interesting\nIt was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because I Am with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just I'm\nFrom the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading them and in fact he's already recommended by nice the official ah UK\nInnate chest guidelines buddy or that one thing you can do with people with dementia is just trying to get them more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and\nTrying to stimulate them ah intellectually in any way you can\nAnd this reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other side of this happening down on with people with dementia things like singing all reminiscent therapy\nYeah feminist since therapy it sounds almost similar because in a way on its cutting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from used and you you might use ... photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get him to talk about some of that very oldest memories and we do know that same people with dementia often it is a very old memories to tell the mixed intact\nSo I guess with the lack of affected medication anything that might help people's memories I said go up to venture is going to be a good idea\nYes it's understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot for dementia I mean they're all some medicines that people can be given they tend to just I'm eve symptoms ... hops don't wet for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to set and not right for everybody so and this is why we're trying such unusual things now\nThank you very much tied Wilson
