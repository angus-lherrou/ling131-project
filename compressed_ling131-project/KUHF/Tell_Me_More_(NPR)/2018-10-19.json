our son had been the cause of the fire\nWho was the person who was accused of having started at\nA young man in his twenties named Harry peak who was um I guess predictably a wannabe actor errand boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing um\n[noise] was well what what happened was he had told\nA number of friends that he had started the fire so\nVery quickly ... ah [noise] once there was a reward associated with anyone having providing a tip for solving the fire\nA one of his friends good to have friends that came forward and um basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up\nI'm interviewing him to figure out\nWhether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're\nIn fact true 'cause he was a\nIt's hot you know streets are wide yeah and you can see a long\nWay [laughter] you know what I mean it has that open dusty field [laughter] um\nYou know it's funny it is a thing is a transplantation of the south it it is and ah [noise] the the people that gravitated there um [noise] the the agriculture that was a a is found root there are a lot of the people\n'cause he just started this of the Central Valley essentially a California where you know whatever it is forty five percent of the produce in the United states has ground yeah\nYeah and and so the ... the black population that came they came for work\nUm Texas Louisiana Arkansas there was you know the migration that there but from the south that went ah to the north and went to Chicago\nAnd ah Detroit or but there was also that group of the family that came from Louisiana Arkansas Texas you know Mississippi that came out west and I'm Bakersfield was one of the places that they settled because there was agricultural work\nIf the interesting thing for me is I caught the last bit of the black a migrant workers a black field workers or who who uh who pitched watermelons and who cut watermelons are who pick fruit\nYour mom was a minister preacher both in Los Angeles when you were young and when you were a little older and a teenager in Bakersfield what kind of church history project\nIs the church of God in Christ which is an offshoot of ah [noise] ah you know it's just holding his uh the Pentecostal you know\nFor her what was important was going directly to the people she was a a street minister and her establishment is where I was called missions\nBecause first of all she had a mission and she wanted to her places of worship to be a place where people could come in any condition so\nConsequently we are all of a of the houses of worship that we had more storefront church as they were a and what I mean by that was like not a purpose built churches this was this was maybe ...\nI think the the first one we had on like you have a new in Bakersfield was a [noise]\nA cafe converted into a church you know we built an altar and put a big air conditioner in there and there we go there put some chairs best the church\nIt's balls I I'm Jesse for talking with jazz singer Gregory Porter his latest album is called Nat King Cole and may I imagine your family must have been central to a church given how big it

you know you got eight kids in that she got you already got acquire\nYou know [noise] and um I imagine\nYou also do already have somebody to sweep up afterwards and yeah absolutely everybody pitches and we were her work we were her\nHer crew was you know the family the family thing we did we didn't realize it was like okay a church is the family business real estate is the family business singing as a family business you but you don't do is just like this is what we grow up doing and um [noise]\nWhat she had a a a conviction on her life and we kinda all had to follow and we we thought it was normal until we realize okay nobody else really picks up homeless people off the streets and take them home like we did I remember my friends coming over sometimes and like who's that man\nAnd it's like this is a you know my mother would would have projects\nShe would she would she would redeem try to redeem people she would meet people and if they seemed like a like like a good people that just and falling down for some reason\nThey will come into the house and my mother was going to clean them up it was going to you know give them good food and going to get them\nPhysically and mentally try
