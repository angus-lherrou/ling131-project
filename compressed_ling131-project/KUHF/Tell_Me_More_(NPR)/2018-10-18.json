to witness it and all those who've made a this campaign and the election of our lifetime possible\nUm I was talking to Amy tonight about this moment\nThat stayed with me um after I first met secretary of defense Jim Mattis\nHe's meeting with members of the armed Services Committee and he reminded us that the United states historically has enjoyed two principal powers to distinguish us from the rest of the world one is the power of intimidation to feel the the most awesome military force the world has ever known\nMe other uh any thought maybe the greater power is the power of of inspiration or to continue to be the indispensable nation that lives up to the promise and the potential of our founders are a nation that not just Americans look up to the world looks up to\nAnd whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now\nMuslim bans the press as the enemy of the people taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying two thousand mile journey seeking asylum here in this country the bitterness the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty\nThat defined so much of the national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nBut I'll tell you what traveling the state of Texas\nMeeting people regardless of their walk of life their background their party affiliation new have inspired me you've inspired me to transcend the obstacles to be the big courageous bowl strong match for this moment on any issue the challenges\nAre in Texas were nearly half of school teachers work a second job just to make ends meet and making sure that we're there for them pay them a living wage and ensure that they can teach to the child\nNot the test and the state of immigrants and making sure that we lead the national conversation free dreamers from any fear of deportation and the least insured state in the country could take the lead on guaranteed high quality universal healthcare\nYou know Arizona in this race

federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor which among other things would threaten to bankrupt Medicare\nI Want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going moving forward congressmen Iraq wants to the next two years to be drawn into the partisan circus of impeachment proceedings against President Trump\nElections are about who we are\nThe wishes fear\nMy mom was the first one of the family to go to college and she was a pioneer professional woman my dad came from Cuba with nothing\nWash dishes making fifty cents an hour came here seeking the American dream if someone had approached my dad in Nineteen fifty seven and said fifty years has your son will be a U.S senator representing the state of Texas that teenage immigrant could never believed\nAnd yet as I stood on the Senate floor with my hand on my dad's Bible there was my father and the gallery tears running down his eyes\nThis is a choice about keeping the boom going keeping we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded the lowest African American unemployment ever recorded why would we want to screw that up\nWe need to defend jobs defend the constitution zero\nDollars that are there times are we appreciate Mr Cruz Mr ... thank you for sharing tonight we appreciate that thanks very nice\nYou've been listening to special rebroadcast of last night's Texas senatorial

U. H. T. T. V. eight point six used or service of the University of Houston [noise]\nCurrently sixty four degrees eighty seven percent relative humidity at the University of Houston it's nine o'clock [noise]\nSchool trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half\nBefore school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district ... Ohio they let us record on the condition\nThat we not see their name on the air it eight people on this team are we to teachers all do it for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians and the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team recently this pollock watch them doing this\nLisa so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of the school\nI saw the ride a bunch of drugs and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe enough you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nIs the principal for grade six twelve\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun round bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one of\nThese shootings and other to count not enough of this way [noise]\nElementary away and you send the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there\nAnd it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown that he and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nSays revving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school aside and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing there were spies\nWasn't great that wasn't the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nSome find that link so upsetting that can't even finished a simulation and there's a more basic problem the surprise drills [noise]\nIf you know when it's coming and if you're shot how can you\nTell that to drill for the real thing\nIt's actually a Melissa both thought this was kind of draw that have\nUnannounced but effect shooter firing line\nActually told her students that's what they should expect\nOh yes one hundred percent I told him I said it could happen at any point in time so just be prepared that no matter what your classroom you're enter where you're at this could take\nPlace they said it was going to sound real and feel real I now have another faculty member who is that another high school and the district and they did the active shooter training at her school and they they use blanks they like it was it was simulated and it felt real and so that's why a lot of people were like\nIs this the drill is is not the drill but when you look at the time that it occurred\nThey don't run a drill it to twenty five in the afternoon Fifteen minutes before we dismissing all these buses have to run kids all over the district\nWithout a question in your mind right away like it's too late for a true yes\nWhich brings us to the day of the shooting at you twenty in the afternoon on Valentine's Day a former student within a are Fifteen began down the hallway and the first floor of the building that everyone calls the freshman building\nAnd an adjacent building actually calling every class had just finished their shrimp can't be lab there are plaguing and cleaning up\nSo I'm standing next to my door pulling my door stop out I'm here to pops it was not rapid fire it was just like pop pop I'm not start off by it because I mean it's Valentine's Day and you don't know if it's like a balloon popping or what and then the fire alarm went off very quickly\nAnd the fire alarm dusted off\nDust from a who's tickle tiles hit by a round of gunshots no one knew that at the time\nMelissa and a building farther out than actually didn't hear any pops just a fire alarm she went into action running natural the fire drill\nThe fire alarm goes off and I counted the kids as as they left the room was the last one to leave the close the door was already locked because I leave it locked out the door with my phone ... and my father does like famous important things my phone Mickey's ...\nHer emergency folder that's the training\nI went out the doors that security person who posted outside my hallway she's there she's and I said oh what's going on because they have walkie talkies I don't the security personnel have like a document\nSo she said some and set off a fire cracker and the twelve hundred building and I said OK and turned into other teachers and I told them and then as soon as I finish saying that to them she out that no go back\nTo code red go back at the code red and so we call to the kids and I turned around and went back to my room which was right there opened up the door and kids start streaming in\nBut was this a real code red molested and now she knew a fire alarm could go off during a code red but the whole thing was confusing\nWell it was weird because we actually had a ... actual fire drill earlier in the day like like our plan scheduled monthly drill had occurred that morning so it was weird that it was going off again because they don't do them in the last period of the day and so I knew it was something but I didn't think it was a serious something\nI thought it was like a the colon area was cooking with oil that day so who knows they settle sometimes that up and fired for us we'll set it off if they burn something or whatever so or other things that set a fire drill a well kids sometimes probably pull and kids will pull it off sometimes there could be like a faulty that's like why our system gets affected all the time\nIt just depends but most of the most is calling area because actually Chris will kill me but a lotta times it's calling area one time we went outside three times in one day because of the color in class that reads times\nYeah I mean we have three smoke detectors in my room so if you walk underneath it with a pot of boiling water you will set the fire alarm off that's kind of like the joke of our school\n\nTeacher that Douglas knew that code red Trump's a fire drill they even had a plan for how to straighten that confusion out make an announcement\nClarify the code red\nOn that day and assistant principal Mr Porter did that is there an announcement on their wise\nBut a lot of people are already out of the room so they didn't hear it\nIn colon area actually heard the code red she's not sure about it but she's going through the motions she goes to her door to pull it shut and if she does\nTo always come running around the corner and they're they're just they looked terrified and they're screaming at shooter shooter\nShe pulls them into our classroom tells them to get in the storage closet with her students but she's still thinking drill right there must be it must be for practice even seconds later when she hears\nPop up up up up up up up up and to me I'm like okay that's not what I experienced and the first real just because of the rap it's a session that was happening at the time I was like maybe they're they're up and their game on that\nIt's unclear how many teachers thought like Ashley and Melissa did that this was not a real code red but the promise code red drill and if this cost anyone their life I spoke to the Broward County chief of staff in charge of organizing the district safety upgrades were Douglas's he said he didn't know any teachers that Douglas\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced drug blanks the age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter ... using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter\nThe shooter actually stood for another second in our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors to face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrify kids running like that\nAnd it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was she knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me under screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the clawed\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nIn her classroom lifted that are attendant sheet out of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group a small enough to fitness applied closet someone's had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there\nIn the closet it was hot and dark except students faces live by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she is on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor um\nAnd so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told her she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had to have that flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nAnd when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is the police then you went in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police has anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this was a police as anyone in your and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure\nI'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really felt because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\nAnd ... and they have organize their lives to be able to reach out to other parents like themselves here's Mickey\nSandia money clubs have traveled to eat mass shooting since Aurora it started with Sandy Hook and I live at stuff San Bernardino Orlando Las Vegas Sutherland Springs Parkland end in Santa Fe Texas which is where I met up with them and may right after a student walked into the high school and killed ten people\nThey pulled up in front of the school and their truck even though they've done is alive and he told me the discomfort and awkwardness they feel about showing up like the community has never gone away\nBut in Santa Fe they just lost themselves in any way\nThree trained a big button with a photo of their daughter Jessie smiling a memorial had just gone up on a grassy lawn out front\nThere were ten would crosses each with a red heart and a photo of the students per teacher who'd been killed people were starting to lead teddy bears flowers and blues Philips do here is just talk to whoever wants to talk\nThey figure that will lead them to families they might be useful to\nAnd within seconds of getting out of their trucks\nThey bumped into a day's teenage girl wearing shorts in Santa Fe high school soccer\nT shirt scarcely how're you doing\nIn here to sound gets muffled because Sandy's tiny might get crushed when they hug\nJanine sound I remember from that day [noise]\nOr just the sorry this has happened to you and your friends and your family's in your community\nAnother girl the junior with brown hair pulled back into a ponytail walks up to them and stares at their button [noise]\nWe lost our daughter and I'm Ashley six years ago\nShe is inside now she was just like your friends\nSandy is good at making people feel comfortable\nShe has around ... odd but she's maternal can keep their comments carrying a brief sickly\nBunnies stands right next to Sandy with his arm around her Sandy's the one who mostly talk to the kids here but he's always by her side listening intently his presence helps her do this\nHe looks out for her sometimes when you had to start the AC in their tracks before she Clemson Hi my name's Tracey Hi you're an adult I was surprised how quickly people opened up to the Philips is Jesse\nJesse the girl who suggested it was pretty she started telling them that she escaped the shooting by hiding behind a building with other students now she just wanted to stay at home but at home all she could think about what the shooting scenes from that day kept replaying too had Sandy doesn't miss a beat here\nOver at the victims assistance they have trauma therapists over there I recommend strongly that any of you can\nReally think about stopping by the victims assistance do some trauma Sarah okay honey [noise]\nFilters don't make money off to their volunteer and they're not wealthy either their retirees living in a two hundred and forty five square foot trailer to writing off of modest savings and Social Security\nSandy sixty eight used to work and tourism for the city of San Antonio ... Seventy four he used to own some car lot and let them know\n[noise]\nSo have you guys met one thing I quickly realized point to Santa Fe is that there are now so many of these mass shootings that they become grim reunion for all the people who show up to them as part of their jobs or volunteer work are you from Las Vegas ... ran into an emergency responders from the Las Vegas shooting and then bumped into this other guy who travels around\nClean up all those white crosses you see at almost every mass shooting me one for their daughter Jessie in Aurora to standing on the ... brown grass now the crosses funny interrupted him to do this thing he and Sandy do a lot by what\nWill they suddenly call it the time we\nEver want to love it I Love all evidence regarding you know\nEleven eleven is a thing a lot of people see it as an auspicious sign for a time to make a wish there was a ... favorite songs\nOver get a letter loving twice a day we know are really had a good day\nThey told me I knew it silly but I take it as a hello regard wink out [noise]\nWith tech hello Miami in Denver what's your name is Cindy Cindy ... lawyer oh I'm so sorry as the day went on people kept dropping by the memorial in front of the high school parents and students to huddle together during the process for writing messages on them\nWas quiet hot I'm Still in there was a low generator come from the gigantic Billy Graham ministry truck set up in the parking lot in this community and then all of a sudden\nThis young guy started wailing Cindy mean it'd be like foreign workers for immediately threw his arms around her what can you hear his pictures [laughter]\nIt's okay it's not okay it's not okay let it go let it let it let it go\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMm oh God I'm so sorry [noise] [laughter] we're we're ... ...\nYeah it's OK honey you're doing it now\nOkay his name is ... he graduated last year there are crosses set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved\nHe said she always tried to be strict with him can never keep them not fought for very long\nTime is Bree taken nice the press [laughter] take a nice the rare [noise]\nOkay okay [laughter]\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the evidence is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs or was it was ... because the strip where he drove drove doors are so able to do and now\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year to build says are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed\nAlex Jones of course is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are still absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere's truth ... or ... troll families of victims on social media\nImmediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things that Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMhm mhm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming Josh\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about his Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tell Me More (NPR)",
