I mentioned earlier that that you have to be the right place to deliver oxygen to a patient and to remove carbon dioxide\nNow this monitor and I'll just do that but they had forty four cases where when they put them on his round they realized they had put the two in the wrong or if as they put it in the office all than in the long so that would have led very quickly to the patient knock at an auction on dying off hypoxia ...\nBrain damage so that was very interesting and it sounds that they've picked up so many on the east coast so called a ... patients\nSo if you could use this kind of equipment across all low income countries won't kind of difference but that may\nWe think it could make a huge difference for instance even in a law wait I said we detected forty four of those cases in six months\nThat ... has a population but seven to eight million so that will give a rate of about twelve itself to ... per million population per year and if you think of the whole population of sub Saharan Africa which is over\nWhen ... and ... million were you would estimate then that almost eleven thousands of ... per year could be detected now obviously some might be detected by other means but this is the most to finish it means and that means that you could save lives\nAnd we also know from previous work maybe on the life box that there are an estimated Seventy times and operate in the world that don't ... really they don't have ... either\nSo we would feel that this is a big number and this is simple breathing monitor that should be available for all these countries like it is in the developed world\nAnd and I sell Avon now change before we go there's new research on one of our favorite subjects sleep on the discovery in mice of a kind of seats which\nIn the brain you know I Do sometimes wonder if we could just do a whole program on Flickr a whole series on sleep at ... at how we could do that too\nNow this is the idea is when you had hit the pillow and funny your sleep is there a single light switch in the brain that is flick like a light on than your goal\nAnd this was a study in ... and they found this region in ... specifically the ... for ... for free up to ... because I Know you on that level of detail I Do I'm sure that I was the center for sleep so\nHe's a few minutes also genetics so if you genetically modified the mice them as a clever trick where if you shine light ... so its impulse of the brain you can do by those brain cells so that's exactly what they did they shined a light on these specific neurons um the the most ... do\nThey readily American Idol I'd be fact of her found\nThat really clever so if you could try and work out how exactly that works and then do that humans we'd all be very grateful potentially audits\nOn top of them go to sleep it's little children waking me up in the middle of the ... [laughter] we need a slightly different solution to that\nSo many people do this will be amazing if you could have some payment just sent you just like just like well\nThis is the idea now that they've been able to show the this is the mechanism this is how it works at least in mice and I suspect to probably legitimate to say something very similar is happening and people there is evidence of that certain people with insomnia\nThis region of the brain doesn't seem to be working as well and in people when they go to sleep in that having that brings in this region does like up as well ... genetically modified people shy and watching that brings do the same experiments asleep on Mars but there's some evidence the same price or something and people [noise]\nSo it might work and it'd be pretty cool if you could just Claudia you're going\nTo sleep at the accidents thank you very much time ... coming out from the newsroom today and thanks to the ... you can find me on Twitter at ... and I'll be back at the same time next week with more from health check by now\nHouston Public media members are invited to a behind the scenes look at public broadcasting with an exclusive free station to our schedule your tour of Houston Public media at Houston Public media dot org slash contact\nEleven ... minute\nOne elevator before you had to the polls November say listen to candidates give their pets love airbags Houston Public media dot org slash pets\nThis is your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty seven K U H accused him K.

face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided didn't seem like a no I'm Kevin up there was a yes and was let's wait a week is if we can made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with them in the days before and after the\nKavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how he made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise]\nJust staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nJust stood me up for an interview\nJeff Flake face can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nCapitol police protection new staff just meet in a lot of new Jeff Flake fans\nThat ended up taking pictures for them\nAll the people I Do [laughter]\nI'm In Central Park west [noise]\nI don't know I was so starved for any sign of\nA bipartisan show\nI'm going to go ahead and said bipartisan in New York means you agree with the Democrats\nThis is all happening because on my way back to New York from Washington on Saturday I ran into Chris Coons on Amtrak\nHe told me flick was on the seller right behind us that we could invited himself\nAlong with Coons to the global citizen concert at the great lawn in Central Park broadcast live on MSNBC can't think of a blue or place to be honest more on the news location for the hash tag resistance so I'm surprised to hear flakes coming to text and to see if I can go gets me credentials and they take them out of town\nYou get a little lost because I'm from here I think I Know where everything is but I don't and then we're running across the eighty sixth street trends we're\nHad to a little trailer back speech meet up with Chris Coons\nOutside tens of thousands of people are already out on the line\nThese two senators are going to deliver a short impromptu speech about bipartisanship to this crowd\nLast level because companies perform for them in his performing\nCurly based out of that is after yeah you guys are the opening act for Carty be\nEnough you know [noise]\nThis is where fleets reaching across the aisle gesture gets ethical surreal and it's hard to ... pounds surreal the weakest dinner ready\nAll these famous people keep popping into the trailer\nYou if you're a hero I was just so funny to those people do is to Robert\nDe Niro step to flake with a finger in his face like a scene from Goodfellas we rely on you\nTo go down with this guy used to go [noise]\n'cause I Know it's because they didn't want to admit terms of this and that it will be on all will be ...\nWeird to Robert De Niro taxi to work in the terms I'm telling you you're a ... year old\nJohn Legend of the should withdraw has its roots and\nWe just we just know that we're all watching hoping that you make the right decision for the kind of like OK that's all I'm saying the director\n... thank you so much for listening when Katie Holmes in three Coontz says none of that is\nThat's great I don't know how to act like usually when\nStarted looking

catches him like run a red carpet\nCause you a hero\nGuy is a guy there\nDo you think we can bring this country together out so it's like a left wing farce at this point random bit players keep popping out to kept liberal styles Chris Martin from Coldplay gets bleak a magic pin some sort to keep in pocket\nOh yeah just to say the\nFolks in terms of Troy\nLeach drops it Chris Martin leads we have a moment to sit down and was it like\nA sense of it is well I mean you know it's not something you know your your sister\nIs different for you know a conference on Social Security reform or a senator\nJohn Mikhail Institute no it's not far from\nShows like having people like Robert De Niro and John Legend like you're a hero to for a week long used to ... to the last week to my next boats are for cabinet or for something that ... I'm a ... do\nYou enjoy it for a week do you think they know you're still a Republican\nYou know turn away okay what\n\nIf we had a rough few years he'd I'm On the right keeps disappointing the last ... good for lunch to be popular or you have do you like it [laughter]\nOh yeah every politician does that mean [noise]\nWe like politicians would we feed on it [noise]\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted after seven days of being treated as a Democrat or at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the G O P\nToday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday freak announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically he didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nYou were satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that stuff [noise] I uh [noise] ... except for only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nMm [noise]\nChase sort of stooges of a program that turn out of this a recording that we found a justice\nAnthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into ... back in twenty ten\nI stand here today justices potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through all that well I like my own uh\nRemember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in the political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful about\nSome southern southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people ask them by the state but cases you'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way it was funny he was a good talker and explain this job\nHow it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us\nVery different feel everyone else was in favor\nOf the death penalty so faced with you know almost a dozen other people who already felt strongly I didn't think I could convince anyone to a of of what I was thinking I was I was just I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven ... was the youngest or by several years and he was a kind of guy who avoided speaking up at all costs at home his neighbor parked in his face he let it go at the office if the boss told them to do something\nEven if you disagreed he did it without question in other words even though we've been looking forward to being a juror when he found himself in the jury room\nSpend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood at the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision and the idea of swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise] he was also afraid that if he opposed the group it would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole\nProcess over again with a new theory everyone would be mad at him\nSo since had nothing to an hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection\nIt was hard to look at him during the sentencing um we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us do what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she's trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and she just hopes [noise] been the foreman announced the verdict [noise]\nAnd I think his mother cried out they had an exit for us to go through after we collect things\nAnd we were out of the courtroom fast\nIt felt like a mistake right away ... over to his parent's house where you had dinner and drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where you had more to drink before bed and then that was not than it was over\nAnd uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life\nOr at least he tried to ... what do you do with what\nThese feelings um I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and um\nYeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt [noise] I've I've ... I felt guilty or you know sending someone a ... throw\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affect you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about what it does\nTo the jurors but for span the trial wasn't something he could put behind him at the crack of the gab all [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict he read every article about the Casey could find\nSo eventually he just stopped\nI realized it wasn't really healthy\nAt the time span was a regular drinker\nAnd it only got worse after the trial I got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone your [noise]\n\nYour after the trial and fans life changed the new house with the hand that can the flagpole was sold and spend moved out of Texas\n\nFence settled in Olympia, Washington started life over you found in an apartment for himself and his cat Nico but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial he tried to escape through alcohol but it didn't free him from a shame sometimes after a night out drinking in return\nTo a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son\nOne mother had already lost her son and now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime it was terrible but to send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh for for current\nThoughts about it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rapid gets shame offers a certain safety it provides a comfortable hole to hide in the way from the judgment of others\nBut it can also lead to isolation and inertia and for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date send barely talked about the trial with anybody but then in two thousand sixteen\nYear after ... stories federal appeal it than that I had\nA reporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your [noise]\nThan was tired of being all alone with his regret [noise] and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings\nI felt guilty he told a reporter\nAnd a little helpless [noise]\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope they're talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published that was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article\n... co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier\nHe misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI thought incorrectly essentially I Believe it would have to\nConvince everyone to choose life imprisonment when\nIn fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fend could've cast\nSo they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness itself so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match permissive ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did begin to reply but I didn't\nHave the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] feel like a really read things are\n\nA few months have just been received Maryland's email and execution date was set the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and Judith cherry the parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want to pass stories family especially his mother\nTo witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI\nI Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain unnerved\nUntil it is acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too forward", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tell Me More (NPR)", "city": "Houston", "day": "11"}
