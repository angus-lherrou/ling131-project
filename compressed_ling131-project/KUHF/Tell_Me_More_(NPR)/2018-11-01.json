{"month": "11", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "So what we're doing time for Halloween was much a campaign ... uses were able to put forward that dilemma isn't questions and stories about go staying via the act if they matched with a profile cod they were able to submit that questions and then I ... to them and gave some advice\nI'm so essentially we're just trying to raise awareness goes thing because I don't think\nI think it can feel like a very lonely experience and ... with us time it's ever happened to someone but out sort of message here is that you're not alone and that and then it's actually alarmingly common somebody's trying to set a conversation sorry today is the thought of that I'm In time for Halloween the history of the year\nAnd do you think old dating apps should take the responsibility like bumble has to try and deal with this and reduce it\nYeah I Do I mean I think they have a responsibility to do that I think\nIt's up to each individual to monitor that behavior but I think what I really like about bumble isn't that proactive about getting rid of bad behavior and discouraging disrespectful behavior on that platform which I think is really encouraging from such a big business and someone who deals with so many different uses\nThe way they do that though is by letting people know sending them a reminder that they haven't replied to somebody's message could not be quite annoying\nYeah potentially I mean it it's sort of a little bit like the new gene now where it gives the automated responses that you can choose from\nAnd I don't know about everyone else but I've sort of just got used to that I founded annoying initially and now I find it kind of semi endearing and move on from it so I think yeah I mean potentially could be annoying but you know if it saves a Heartbreak Hill said someone from being posted or sort of modified collectively al behavior than I think it's worth it\nTight Labor Day the newly appointed boasting specialist at bumble LOU LOU with just a practice you're aware of posting\n[noise] so I'm going to be a little\nBit cynical here and said that um go sing has always existed but the apps have absolutely exacerbated that kind of behavior but the apps care about does not be\nYes they care about how people feel that it's more because it affects the user experience\nAnd what we've seen when we've interviewed other companies is that once a user has a bad experience on your app delete you so that's why ... dressing this all comes down to how much these companies are analyzing their own user data and seeing how that leads to change in behavior\nUm so a a if you if you have to sum it up um in fact actually next week I'm going to a panel um in Singapore Bloomberg near not economic foreign panel\nAnd one of the uh one of the things as we are going to discuss how\nAI is influencing how apps are controlling their user behaviors and what that means for technology has a hole in the future\nSo so yes I'm going back to go sing behavior um it's something that apps probably have picked up by a massive amounts of data and realized hey this is causing a bad user experience on our platform\nYeah and I suppose the risky as if people do feel that they are being goes did on that platform they would blame the person who's doing it all end up blaming the platform and possibly leave it altogether\nAbsolutely yeah okay and what about this idea of tech companies sending remind does to people after three days if they have been contacted someone who's not just stepping over the line really getting a bit too involved in people's private lives\nSo I've seen 'em ups try to experiment with this both ways I'm so taking example from WhatsApp uh what's that allows you to see if the other person has read your message right and some people like it what we chat which is tremendously popular in China more than a billion users\nThe founders they had a massive discussion over this question on whether they wanted other people to see if um the receiver actually read their message so I think I'm your if your app offers something unique\nUm diversified that caters to humanity then maybe you will have a core audience so maybe some people would prefer the fact that this app is prompting you to give responses and others will say hey this app is very good at protecting my privacy\nAnd so even if I go see it you can't do anything about it it goes both ways\nPays you what do you think do you think the tech companies are getting a bit too involved here which would you like one of those reminders that would you rather they just stayed out of it I think I'd prefer the straight out of the ghosts\nIs is ancient I mean when I was a young man we didn't have social media\nBut you'd go out with a with a girl several times you know when you're in college and then you decide that well it's time to move on and you don't call her again that's a form of ghost thing but on the other hand do you call someone up to say you know I don't think we should date anymore but certainly if you've been seeing somebody six months\nYou owe it to them to do that but I I remember women when I was in college complaining well you know I was dating Charlie went out with them four times and then he never calls me anymore and they never knew why ... I think it comes down to etiquette and and how we deal with the delicate issue of saying to someone I prefer not to communicate any further\nWell thank you very much for that pays a we're running out of time now in business and that in fact the end of the ... and say thank you very much to pay them a raise the in Washington and Lee ten in Hong Kong because that is will be back tomorrow [noise]\nYour vehicle can be a real asset to the intellectual life she spent donate your car to news eighty seven and will use the proceeds to inform and inspire does it Houston Public media dot org slash vehicle to donate your vehicle\nThis American Life next on news eighty seven the national weather service worker showers and wonder storms for this evening one hundred percent chance of precipitation low around fifty nine degrees\nFinally clearing up tomorrow morning a little bit later on some of these guys for Thursday I around sixty seven degrees this weather update brought to buy touch the solar outfitters local solar energy professionals\nA tornado watch remains in effect until ten pm for South eastern\nTexas this is your NPR station is used in public media news eighty seven K U H accused him KU HDTV eight point six used in service of the University of Houston it's nine o'clock [noise]\nGrade it was so long ago who can remember that far back to ... years\nEvery every other like the old things like we used to read at the vet Harry Potter and um we made ...

never been there in the first place [noise] we forget must have everything and then sometimes they go back and try to remember and it really is no\nPredicting which people and places moments we're going to be able to get\nBack to Anna Maria they could still make the cut [noise]\nYou know\nIt turns out there are a lot of Susan Jordan too don't remember me a lot one guy even called his ex wife a former student Jordan and then called me back to tell me she never heard of me I was getting nowhere by myself so I contacted a professional one urban ... when a\nCertified New York city private investigator three days after putting them on the case I got a message saying he'd founder I called them back\nI call the morning early or roughly around seven thirty mhm [noise] but she didn't want

unable to tie wishes in Jordan should that me and I said okay and I should I or do you know anybody they are which Blumberg and right away she baby shower [laughter] is um\nThe interesting part about the whole thing is she definitely likes you members you and uh she's going to call you\n[noise] [noise]\nHello this is Susan yeah this is Alex Bloomberg Hi Alex my family I'm doing okay how are you mind if you get my email I got your email yeah a lot of ... and like I called you at work and then I realized that I I'd also gotten this number from the from the private investigator\nSusan and I talk forever three hours on the phone is catching up comparing notes that she has to buy my sister and kids that used to live in the street or\nAn old timely Darren how are you doing I'm\nDoing okay it was amazing how much you remembered and how much we remembered and comment doing it even small incident like the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and I stay on too long at the guy in the motorcycle\nI think I remember it\nWas it on the area of new probably probably and he said did he say something to you and I said no he didn't say anything to me and he said he said something to you didn't and you were about to get out of the car\nAnd bad guys as I'm sure\n[laughter] I think I can remember your face I think you are sitting very ill with your hand in your lap where are you afraid\nI was terrified that [laughter] yeah I Do know that you would notice [laughter] but uh\n[laughter] well don't worry but I I wouldn't take any now [laughter] I had no fear I'm telling\nYou [noise]\nDo you remember a time [noise] um [noise]\nYou know we it was like maybe six or seven or eight years after you baby sat us [noise]\nUm and I was wearing your store yeah Irish and [laughter] [noise]\nHey Norway trainer was right at the thrift way yeah [laughter] I remember I guess you were you begging my courage change at the but I didn't recognize shave I don't I don't you told me the word and I did right [noise]\nRight I think he said my pet\n[laughter] like I did for a few [laughter] people still call you that [laughter] [noise]\n\nGot married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company has a repair person she spent the next Twenty years or so hanging from a telephone pole and she said\nShe hated us the money was good [noise] around the time her first marriage ended she finally got the courage to quit and find work using her degree\nShe now teaches at a special school for mentally ill children she lives in Florida with her second husband and she seems happy [noise] of course when you got back into the past like this you find have partial an incomplete your memory is first or the facts you get wrong\nTurns out Susan had been a college freshman when she babysat us not in high school like\nMy sister remembers you'd written a motorcycle also not true and the guy who she got in the fight with the cats in my mind was her harried seventies boyfriend turned out to be her roommates boyfriend but besides the facts you change though the facts you completely admit\nThat fire with the cats Susan had forgotten totally that I'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she forgotten other details you remembered San even the names of the cats themselves\nPossum and Tom [laughter] we were hillbillies to remember that [laughter] and uh but I Can't imagine what I took you over there for\nI'm sure it was for you know I think we were just running errands they're still lucky [laughter] it's it's funny\nBecause when I when I like you know I remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them and and probably the reason I remember it is because it\nSeemed very significant to you I think I sensed as a kid that that you were than it was really upsetting to you because it it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point you can trust\nOh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved out of town I had no family at all\nI see I moved out that day I graduated from high school mhm and I was Seventeen cars I started a year early I had I just wanted out every day that's I'd found out that I got the scholarship mhm I packed up that night [noise]\nWhy'd you want to get out of it because my family wouldn't the functional that my mom and it was pretty bad\n[noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with at that time she was taken all on a truck and her boyfriend and every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really do it much at all and it was really it was\nIt was tough to come home and I I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really missed my\nLittle brothers and my little sister\nAnd they were gone\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember you so fun with those because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] it's only you knew he probably wouldn't have hired me but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy to know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk and I would just run out [laughter] and\nI'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably thought what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSee sort of talk to us and said\nYeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nMm\nEvery time the subject of a hard times came up a hero settle hesitancy into St Louis at first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly no\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was she was waiting for the other shoe to drop she hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it\nInterfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but I I Would be devastated if anything different\nMm there are\nParts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to the proceeds from Jordan you're for life that I remember is he or she just as soon forgot and it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but yeah\nI didn't think of myself as where it all but Susan joined reminded me in the gentle terms possible when I was nine I was anxious and bookish was kind of uptight\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like he had a whole lot of\nToys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly folks and more educational things I mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a\nChemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I had babies and then you just need more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nYou know\nI did three shows or two in a two in Tokyo and one in\n... and all three just just great old trees sold out in ... we set our club record for the largest attendance at a it was so packed we couldn't actually get on stage\nThe only way out was about to sling myself over the audience and they carried me on the hands back through the crowd and generally deposited me at the stage dome so this is your last game that was your last good yes\nAnd and it ended with the entire audience lifting you up in passing you bodily ah out and gently depositing you out out of the club at the ... well not out of the carpet to the stage door yeah\n... it was amazing\nI I don't think I've ever really been affected by a mob of teenagers and people in their twenties um what what exactly is that like\n[noise] um well in ... I felt\nPretty good about it [laughter] I'm not sure how I Would have felt about it in London in Nineteen Seventy something whether scene was incredibly violent you know whenever you played you're you're just as likely to get beaten up or do we get paid [noise]\n\nDescribing it was like to come back after the Torah it was hard for me to get motivated again to do my business off to the um ... off to the tool [noise] it it just wasn't as thrilling as being on a stage in front of cheering well not many things ah [noise]\nI just ... like sort of you know you know my my dad's\nGeneration you know I have to sort of you know growing up as a kid you know being fired\nOn an ... in in World War two and all that kind of stuff it was just kind of hard to getting getting it up for a for you know working at the shipping in the shipping industry again ...\n\n... ... ... ... shortly after I go back a Steve ... was in town and that is\nUh he's he he he was the original producer and he was also my roommate\nAt the time that that all the automatic stuff was going on uh and uh now he's you know incredibly successful yes like you to take Matthews and all that stuff you know and and anyway he was in town they had some time and then so we hung out together for a couple of days and the hunter was off um\nAnd a wife yes hundred or so um\nYou know we got to hang out and we talked a little about the old days and they tell me you know big poll from from ... uh uh does catering in a you know ... and a nod Joe from the men buzz in Australia and\nNow and uh and Walter from the heartbreak 'cause
