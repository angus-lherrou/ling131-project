is no longer a science fiction thanks to a new tool called CRISPR cast nine\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast nine to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies are already raised almost a billion dollars to apply CRISPR cast nine as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't the technology at all [noise]\n\nSo you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how\nHas become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's land that was to any ten\nYou wouldn't find a single mention of Christopher\nIn you know the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR a but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out\nWe now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't do about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR to how to study whatever biological question they go after Endeavour laboratories because\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works and\nIf we know that DNA encodes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how CRISPR cash nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly enter spaced short\n... repeat and cash nine is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise wave any ... any living thing from bacteria to people\nYou know coming back to the four letters of DNA\nThink about those eight hundred dictionaries filled with the same for letters and now imagine that you have to search for a single page and not just single page but a single letter on that page and mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an aide to a tea not an aging or an aide to see [noise]\nSo for decades this was the kind of signed the sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does\nAnd I'll just add one copy out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so\nIf you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of getting to the right cells and that's the same challenge it every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patients\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health can be achieved his ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine a future you stem cell technology together as Chris protests nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience and I suspect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline to the next few years\nWhat really got folks speaking this past year was the report in may that for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR cast line to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that could be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked\nAnd many fear that this technology can be abused that it would usher in an Arab eugenics or designer babies were select few could pick and choose the best use for their offspring\nOthers would say a free deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicated disease it would be immoral\nCRISPR cast line is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live and\nAnd they're already ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated [noise]\nThat ... when we come back in just a

who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I\nI think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR it could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like\nWhether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or leaner muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology\nThat could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you nailed delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet absolutely\nSo do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nBoth of them kept rubber bands around there is both of them flush the toilet before using it as well as after\nAnd both of them like to I surprised people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them John [laughter]\nSorry my thing too good to be true\nAh when you administer\nA batteries a\nPsychological tests or you get the same results namely identical twins separated at birth show are quite astonishing similarities\nThat's just unbelievable so then like even things like like habits or or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and the jails and the first couple of years of life\nAh there are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you're undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars\nBut I think there's certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you think about like who you are I mean do you do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself is basically the same kind of person I like the same music I like same foods I liked the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests are and then and research on personality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character or\nAs they go through life but a ... there's certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred and most people as they as they get older we get less an erotic we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty adult he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSending it if we are more or less the same right at twenty or at Seventy is it even possible to make big changes to to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and uh and easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are probably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they are our ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe still have to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricate complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social\nMechanisms of of interacting to language facial expression the body language that there are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and of\nEvidence based psychotherapy so there is scope for for a range of behavior within the ... up with a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the on hope for the genes make available to us\n[noise] do you when you think about what what an eight person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because he interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are a attempt to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion finances and no one can keep track of all of them even in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together and not not the exotic cases of beer twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf you know ... a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to people plucked off the street at random but they're unique individuals that they you you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not France and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a\nNow how do you account for those differences it's not fair I jeans at least not the ones they inherited from their parents that could be some a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic we acquired\nA it's not there by march their environments because they grew up in the same parents the same school the same house the same older obscene younger sibs\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a fair chance for the role of the dice in a who we become because ah\nTo people who have everything in common both in the genes and the environmental level nonetheless don't turn out to be a distinguishable\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker has
