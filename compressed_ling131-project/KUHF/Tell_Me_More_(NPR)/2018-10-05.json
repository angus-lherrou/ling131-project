to sort of your second nickel intervention into this sort of supplementing the body's own abilities if you like\nSo anti parties or proteins that the immune system naturally makes and they have the ability to target a molecule in mind to it\nAnd what Greg figured out was how to make these anti parties and make them in a humanized way so when you inject them into humans are body won't think of them as foreign\nAnd will accept them and then he also figured out a way on how to improve the finding of the antibodies to target the Nobel Committee makes is important point the seas using evolution in the lab\nYes exactly so you have the target and you produce a whole library these antibodies\nAnd then some of them will bind more tightly to your target you choose them and then you're amplified them\nAnd then you go to the next round and choose the tighter of those and so after a few rounds you have an antibody that binds very tightly ... says kind of design an immunity\nI wouldn't say it's design or because you didn't design anything you let the system choose and that's in fact the opposite of design you're letting evolution of selection choose what are the body to produce\nI chose that were designed because the winner of the other half of the chemistry prize told this program two years ago that evolution is the best designer of all time\nFrancis Arnold was on Fox and action actually twice in twenty sixteen first when she was the first woman to win the much thought millennium prize for her chemistry using circle directed evolution and the second time for experiments using it to incorporate the elements silicon into living molecules\nReally very simple to direct the evolution of proteins because we can mutate the DNA that encourages protein we can make thousands versions of the protein and rapidly search through those to see which ones are better at something that we're interested in\nAnd this whole idea that\nEvolution can be used rapidly to solve human problems I think is very powerful and especially for inventing new chemistry\nPhysics prize like the chemistry one comes in to pass both to do with the power of light\nOne office are asking who invented a laser

T shirt\nHome I did it work yeah totally were on that it was like before you do when you bought something on the Internet you know you couldn't give them the money over the Internet oh my God like I like filled out a Web form and then had to mail a check\nThat out to be the original classic uh tarot cards design yeah that was why they don't make those who do either of those you know sold on ...\nTanks [laughter] sorry guys how much I don't know where they many teachers I think I got forty or fifty bucks for you\nYeah admitted to I'm Glad it was over over twenty bucks I was going to be by my body has changed and I said you're fast why you can find shapes or think Kyle is very kind of you so what was your relationship like Kyle I'm I'm looking at you because you were the grown up I was the grown up\nOur relationship was uh it definitely was kind of a big bro I think at first I jak was just such a unusual interesting he didn't he just was it like you and I hear the very kind of\nI Would say kind of an alternate upbringing sort of more of an open which I think tend to to ah facilitate jacks creativity and but not like a like me not like a great student so to be so I think we bonded on\nOn a in the music and acting and\nCreativity and all that can sort of stuff and yeah it was a it was very satisfying\nAs well as I I'm Jesse Thorn my guests are Jack Black and ... gas there the band tenacious D. I get the impression jak that you were a genuinely disastrous student\nI was not good at the book learning [laughter] uh I had trouble in school I think that I ...
