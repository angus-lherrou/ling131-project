prepared for the annual conference of the national association of business economics central bank chairman says the current combination of low inflation and very low unemployment shows the country's going through as she put it extraordinary times\nYeah I mean I Can't understand why people were angry you know they were probably thinking well wait a minute we've lived with his\nPower plant for generations and now you're going to sell the land to developers and make condos we can't afford them and push us out of our homes\nYeah and I think that\nThey'd been seen that story play out again and again and again throughout the neighborhood\nAnytime there was a piece of land that that came up maybe there was a little set aside for affordable housing but that wasn't nearly as much as people thought there should be\nSo while they see people coming in and said oh OK babies no longer the ghetto we can\nRead develop it that it wasn't necessarily read developed with them in mind and so their greatest fear here was that the story was about to play out again and it stunk even more because it was the site that they had fought for\n[noise]\nHolding space for painting Greece was never part of my job description as an architect but I've seen what happens when there's space for pan [noise] it can be transformational when we first started working in the neighborhood [noise] one of the first things we did was go out and interview the activists who had led the fight because of fat we consistently heard\nAnd felt from them a sense of impending off\nWhen I was in Ireland go running around in the bay view it was a little different because it was more families\nBack then as a child was perfection [noise]\nPeople were leaving or dying of old age and with those departures stories were\nBeing lost a lot of people had open door policy you can just go from one building to the next [noise]\nNo one was going to know the amazing thing is that had happened in this community because to everyone on the outside\nIt was the ghetto [noise] where's the place of violence at best a blank slate neither was true of course some of my colleagues and I reached out the story corps and we built listening that's on our fight\nAt the end of the block was a sewer system and of course we have the smells every morning and all of that\nAnd we invited the residents to comment and have their stories recorded for posterity\nUh what was special about about that area is that there was this patching green grass we had no parts around so either we played on the block in the street or we found this little patch\nAfter a few days of recording we how the listening party\nMy dad worked there for a job she was a fisherman he'd raise chickens he had a garden every Saturday I just remember people come to my house with bags and getting strawberries and I didn't I didn't feel like I was poor living and probably just because I grew up and they view it was one of the\nMost amazing community meetings I've ever been a part of in part because we didn't just talk about joy but also pain\nWhen the crack epidemic hit it went crazy\nPlaces I bet you became more crime rate and investors\nAnd right now we're just losing so many families [noise]\nWe can I create cities for everyone [noise] unless her first willing to listen to everyone [noise]\n\nUm and we should say that you know the debate over how this site will be developed as I think it's still ongoing right yes [noise]\nWhat happens if if nothing changes if um you know cities like San Francisco and New York aren't just anomalies but that we start to see that in lots more places I mean we are right yeah and people who\nHave lived in neighborhoods in those cities that were relatively affordable can't do it anymore and ... what happens if nothing changes\nGosh that's a hard question I mean what we're seeing happening right now it's unsustainable and and when I say on sustainable I don't mean that it can continue to happen but I think\nThe things that we ascribe to being beneficial for living in a society or in community the aspirations we have what that looks like eventually all of this pushes it to the point where that breaks\n[noise] I mean I think part of a system that's driving this is\nYou know it developers who by the land in the building condos and then expect a certain return like from every every unit every condo sold right\nYeah but could you test out something that works in a different way yeah I mean like could American cities take you know big chunks of land and do something very different without land\nIt's a it's a huge better frisk and it would require you setting up um other metrics of success\nRight like happiness or wellbeing or or health outcomes or\nYes I think it's completely reframing how we think about this like we shouldn't be talking about how we should be talking about homes yeah\nBecause we talked about housing we judge or a success number of units created\nShouldn't we be judging in terms\nOf number better lives flip\nIt it it's harder to figure out how to measure [noise]\nI don't know if this grand project that we hold the city\nUltimately can work if we don't start to measure our success in those terms\nThat architect Liz or do you can check out her entire talk at ... dot com\nBuildings humane cities guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour\nFrom NPR\nWas

everyone and especially the most vulnerable [noise]\nWere you um were you born and like yeah I actually ... and I spent most of my life certainly go says your home is illegals as your home since ... we became human in the world [laughter] yes it was good for you accurate this is the man a big day she's a writer in Lagos, Nigeria\nBut the kind of stuff aren't is generally about rights these issues human rights to do it for good on the rights of the urban poor\nThey can you describe what goes on is like like what what what I see I Want their ... so I guess it depends\nOn which legal she live and right and I think that maybe this is the universe though with the city's up once and like you can be in the same physical speeds\nBut because of your identity associate location you experience it completely different and so for instance the legal said I experience is different from the legal is that my daughter's ... experiences\nSo you're driving down the said mainland bridge and you look to your right where you lived in the case may be and you can see some of the fishing supplements that have\nNow been termed slums along the side of the bridge which can be land feeling that's being done on the other side within reclaiming the legs and in order to build some sort of middle class entertainment slash parking garage shooting\nAnd if you're going from the mainland to the island in the landscape of the season changes the houses are bigger pay more expensive the cars and nice they're [laughter] they're traffic lights them work and you know and I think we guard list of which legos you experience you do see the darkness of the differences\nAmong those clan lines\nAnd that and ... get only deep and over the past forty or fifty years and like ... thanks in part to an explosion and population growth and the changing economy\nClass has become much more than he meant it [noise] um glass mobility is not as\nClear cut doors possible that used to be in my grandfather's generation it was it was easy to send one or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them in their siblings or their cousins to school and flew me sort of lift the whole family\nOut of poverty in one or two generations right and that's no longer possible\nBullet demand a dig bay except this idea from the pet stage [noise]\nIt's not a one size fits all thing but I think pre twentieth century cities all around the world tend to be much more dynamic lyrical places\nTo Venice let's just take that as\nYou look at those arch pedestrian bridge is you're going over it's now\nThe clearance is actually quite low so the person is offering bundle of standing and they know they have to duck\nTo get under the bridge so they don't call a lawyer when their forehead hits the bridge 'cause they've made a mistake they know it's their responsibility\nTo duck and so I think to get to a more humane city that entails may be more risk but more reward you know you can go to Israel to India to Rome and you'll find um there was a building block for building density in the nineteenth century which was\nOne elevator this kind of a charming cable elevator right that has like coming through it and then there's one staircase the cops around it and usually that apartment building had like twenty unit\nAnd you see that each building is maybe fifty feet long sixty feet long and so you get this tremendous variation one is brick one stone doorways are different [noise]\nAnd so you have this kind of rhythm along the street\nYou run into your neighbor everyone knows each other it's very communal [noise]\nThat form of building is a legal today because of fire codes and wheelchair regulations and a whole bunch of things so now you need you know\nA few elevators and you need to set the fire stairs and that's all connected by a law anonymous hallway and suddenly a developer is really incentivized to build a two hundred unit building instead of a twenty unit building\nIn order to sort of advertised all of that cost and as a consequence it's very hard to know your neighbors and the two hundred unit building and so the scale which we build is different\nAnd a more mass produced and so you see the same building landing in Shanghai Mumbai and Dubai and so I I don't want us to be an architect or an urban planner to understand these issues I think people are feeling this viscerally I hear this\nEverywhere I go from everyday people who aren't trained in this at all but field is kind of creeping homogenous nation of their world\nFish I'm shocked her body picks up his idea from the Ted stage\nNow maybe you think I'm just being the ... why does it matter who cares if there is this creeping sameness setting our planet well it matters because\nMost people around the world are gravitating to urban area of\nGlobally and how we design those urban areas could well determine whether we thrive are not as a species and this is not just an aesthetic issue mind you this is an issue of international consequences because today\nDay literally hundreds of thousands of people are moving into a city somewhere\nAnd when you think about that after yourself or they can down to live in the same bland cities we built on the twentieth century or can we offer them something better [laughter]\nIt seems to me that one of the things that make many cities especially cities and wealthy countries\nSomewhat inhumane if they're in accessibility to so many people it's it's it's like you know the city has become this inhumane place because it keeps people away because it is so expensive to live in a city like like New York city or San Francisco or or Boston or London or\nParis yes and in fact one of the things I worry about with the U.S is you know\nThere's a lot to compliment about European cities but one of the things we need to be really careful about his most European cities have almost all of their poor people living on the outskirts on the periphery a and only really the well to do live in the heart of these beautiful cities that we talk about\nAnd the problem often is market rate housing doesn't feel like it's helping to address the problem because you know it's out of reach now there are ways in which government subsidize affordable housing but as an architect one of the things we're looking at is how do you lower the cost of housing\nSo that construction costs can come down and that allows people to charge less rent a than they otherwise would\nAnd this is where mass transit infrastructure and infrastructure more generally is so important because\nWe don't have to think about the city is just the city limits there is a region around every major city and if we have better mass transportation to get people to work from twenty or thirty or forty miles outside of the city then they can live a transit oriented lifestyle without living in the heart of\nThe city and a lot of people will choose that if we give them good transit options and we're actually seeing those transformations happening all over the world in big ways in small ways\nAnd just a moment to shine imagine how technology could help me design cities and allow us to bring the humanity of older cities into the twenty first century\nStay with us from guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nCasey Gerald grew up gay black and poor in Dallas and
