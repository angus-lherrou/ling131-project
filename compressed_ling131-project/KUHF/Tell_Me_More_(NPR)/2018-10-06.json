just made a plate of spaghetti and then he says\nOh no there's a cockroach on my food I bell load\nWhat should entering a cockroach on top of my spaghetti you forgot the first rule of survival in this apartment said Henry without sympathy never leave food out you didn't teach me that rule I said you should have learned it before coming here don't enlisted in the military if you're not prepared to fight\nI threw the passed away and the cockroach since I'm unable to kill anything directly even cock roaches with which our apartment was infested though no one had ever been so brave estimate my food\nAfter dumping the pasta I boil some more water and started all over\nHenry From his coach told me to wash my dish and added that I should always washing my dishes before eating he explained to me teaching me some survival rules after all that are cock roaches we're walking all over our plates while we slept leaving behind in invisible trail of germs\nSo we were to wash dishes before eating as well as after\nHe came into the kitchen and rent to play to demonstrate\nThis special to step methods first talk water to get rid of the cockroach germ she said than cold to get rid of the lead

for cockroach cold for less hot for cockroach cold for led by God it I said well don't catch on to quickly that's the problem with staff once they know what to do they leave\nIt was a backhanded compliment but it made me feel good he didn't want me to leave\nI Love that thank you very much I Know that you have a boxing named the herring won because you have actually bulk stink too bad you why did you do that\nI got into the ring because I had a romantic notion of fighting you know lifting up those ropes and getting in there it was almost like when I was a child I used to wrap towels around my neck and pretend it was a Cape than I was a superhero\nShow boxing was a chance in real life to play hero to and then I got in the ring and I discovered\nOh we'll one it's terrible to be hit and I know you're I've learned a lot about brain injury sins so it's not very good to be pounded in the head\nAnd then it was terrible to hit other people I I Would hit someone and I'd see their face grim is and I would say oh I'm Sorry and my trainer the course of don't apologize [laughter] isn't that the point of it I should say I was called the herring wonder\nBecause at the time and I still do I ate a lot of herring and I followed it you know it's a it's a fish low on the food chain so doesn't have a lot of mercury has a lot of oils and it's good for the brain especially if you're getting hit so that blows out of the brain killed some brain cells\nBut the oils from the herring build them backups are just sort of maintain an equilibrium and Disney sting well yes that was my other thinking ... herring breath in a way\nTo further repel my opponent so I Would come into the ring with a jar of herring in my hand you know like a fight with spinach and then my fans in the audience were waving silver herrings\nBut then you say this is another thing I could be a really good to have an ... or some way of putting off your I find that you make some very strange noise here still go back to your

challenged anti heroines and dangerous ... almost and fatal attraction when his latest film the wife is about the celebrated American Vita like by germs price\nWhose spouse might have more to do with the writing of his novels than he would like to admit the film begins quite unusually for mainstream movie with the sex scene between two ... said the BBC's ... off the land place how was it uh\n[laughter] yeah the first scene that was shot well is it [laughter] which\nActually looking back was probably the best seem to shut shoot first because certainly we had to trust each other and it really kind of established the fact that they still had a sexuality together which I think it was very important\nAnd the loss of last yeah\nBut the audience last yeah ... it's very tough because it opens with this great love them from the other half the couple and then it's slowly yeah\nIt seems to me that the whole movie pivots on your ability to know over ... over ... gradual\nWhat fascinated me about\nThis role\nBecause I had to answer for myself why she never left him Joe please don't thank me or speech for [noise]\nI don't want to be thought of a long suffering\nBottle record drawn you know one sentence if I [noise]\nAnother tricky thing about this piece was that you see us in the very beginning and you see is at the end you don't see any of the middle she had to have a great idea of what most of their life had been like because the audience doesn't see that\nI Know you you will always be known for playing Alex in a fatal attraction is women do these troubled woman but somebody described and the other day tightened the trash is being amongst a movie like Jules\nScared people as much as jaws I think wow me in a shot [laughter]\n[laughter] that's funny\nDo you think that movie
