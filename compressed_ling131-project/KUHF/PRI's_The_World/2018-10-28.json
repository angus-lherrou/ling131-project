everything was different\nYou are in college at the University of Canterbury\nYeah and I and I just I just awful place but I I just I just had to you know find a forum in which I could you know capture everything for not just for us but for everyone around us we saw Singapore and a very boring light and I and George and I just you know drove around always looking for interesting places and and faces we we\nWill as I understand like Singapore because it seems the public intent of its presentation is so determined the ... modern and rigorous and straight ahead and straight up although despite all that it's a weird place and you were trying to show it's weird yeah this is the counter narrative and so you've finished shooting great we did it\nAnd in a way to hear from drawers what's going on what's going on and pools\nAnd proof um you\nKnow disappears he disappears it I mean really disappears forever\nYeah I mean it was it was a complicated thing of trying to track him down and

to college and get splintered as um we we no longer you find that to go after him\nAnd you know the thing is I'm so George\nWhen he took the ... and this might be a spoiler but he kept them in his room and his houses if it was like a captive like a kidnapped person it was like a part of me I guess metaphorically speaking I'm so he left a black hole in our lives and I think one of the ways\nShe creates um George creates by kind of leaving behind absences you know and he just want it to be remembered by that black hole because it wasn't a creative guy you didn't create one left holes in the ... and people remember him through those whole road\nSo fast forward Twenty years after this episode that pet haunted you and and ruin friendships out of the blue the look the pieces of film subtly show up on your doorstep ... what were your emotions\nI was like I approached it with so much trepidation because I knew that as soon as they opened up these boxes um they were like Pandora's box as they were just going to suck me down some kind of dark rabbit hole from which I might never emerged and might you know ...\nYou know like I don't I wouldn't be obsessed with the things I I knew I had to be ready before I could open up these bumps and look at them and and so I didn't actually open those boxes for three years and they said like why you're not\n[laughter]\nYou didn't open for three years you don't say that in the documentary no because I mean it's the ... that is just such a digression um but I didn't\nKnow but you're like bury the lead\nAnd well I I just you know I just couldn't like I was growing up I I had a new life and I knew that this thing which is how set me into the black hole\nWe are in here we are so newsletter talking about it but did you pretty immediately think you ought to turn the whole story of the film into a documentary\nBecause I had to you know sixteen on your phone was incredibly hard to see I Do not have seen back I didn't have the equipment I had to take it to a lot in Burbank, California to to get ditches high so I could look at it\nAnd you have to get did you guys have you gonna do anything with it right away and I sat next to this color is and we worked on the criterion blue race of A Douglas sirk movies so he knew about color and I want somebody who knew about color and his judge has dropped and I thought okay he was a stranger in nothing but a story you nothing but ...\nThis programming it's ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the flying ... story of a quest for true love open season in the restored for them to bring nineteenth through November second Houston grand opera dot org\nYeah definitely I mean if it didn't have a sense of humor it wouldn't be fun right\nAnd there's a kind of a dead bands surrealism that I associate more with modern American in the nose\nYeah like ... um yeah I think John ... is a big influence from well like visually say\nAnd what I Want to pause if we can on ... who is who is there is a kind of number belly laugh ... comic under ... out of his whole thing what particular uh movies of his did you love\n'em I I think generally um maybe there was a bit of um the look of um mystery train\nAnd then there was you know and um you know some of the colors but this movie brimming with like bright colors and primary colors and\nWe were going for something ... that was completely ah in opposition to stare out um\nYou know just grey Singapore um St Bart's responsibility in school and business and offices um so there was a bit of John Waters as well on a lot of the American indie aesthetic we were going to\nWe were in and you know recently um a friend of mine was friends with Jay Root benefits I think I'm edits ... and he saw some of the footage and his jaw dropped because he thought there was some collective unconscious you know some something that's going on\nWhere these kids in this this very distant part of the world were doing something that kind of looked like they were trying for something that that people in America doing at the same dry and oh it\nIs like an alternate history that has been suppressed at least to me and to everybody about your friends ... and you until now\nUm but but it is like a like a weird natural experiments of global culture the dirty words tune in Singapore feeding off the same influences I'd guys fumes or whatever as these directors in America at the turn of the century\nYeah yeah I mean it really feels like that right I guess it doesn't really feel like like that like you you\nIn chambers speedy it never\nAs terrible as it winds and it made him wonder how was it pretty place too [noise]\nSo I have some grass options so grass to me really as a sweet home where she had been enslaved by the gardeners sad sweet grass\nAnd this to me has that kind of ... and being the plantation yes has that ... quality up\nBut it's a very I mean this is the most completely pleasant said do you walk to near me\nIt's a hard now so it's a little bit later you have more space\nIt costs for those harder beliefs are top yeah and then there's this one moment where her lover sets his lover appalled deer he had kind of escaped into Delaware found this woman the first black woman whose house he could get into a became lovers with her and\nHer later within solve pale cut and she and two pillows in her bedroom and he had to wipe besides quickly quickly so she would not see the thing for two years\nOf a man is the first time in the soil grass mud shocking leads have cops see show\nAll that he slept on white caught and she had never cooked his mind [noise]\nPaul D and describes the comfort of laying and hey as the only comfort he'd known before he understood what it felt like to sleep and some cotton sheet so I was just kind of interested in finding something that would\nHinted that hey notes because I think have is a little bit more evocative as a sense of\n[noise] well that's [noise] that's natural it's hey [noise] it's really who ...\nThan she did the magic is to set the speed and legs and massage them until she cried salt to [noise]\n\nThat really for me when Amy Denver the white woman who I guess isn't dentures servant she basically ... feet and makes her cry\nAnd I was like oh the bomb is one rubbing your\nFeet when you're beaten and being chased by evil white people and you need sucker and and this woman is giving to this horrible I mean it's kind of racist\nYou gave it get its really deep you know so I was like we need to have that moment to tears I wanted to produce here so I have two accords\nRecord means flood accord physically small donors and yeah yeah exactly do two to five this is salts clean I don't really know what makes it clean I Love it and it's just dry salts they're not natural there around the chemicals and this was\nSort of sweet or what is it um that once we did salts a clean salt innocence jai salt so this is a little bit more dry on a\nMilk she said I was pregnant with Denver but I had milk for my baby girl I had stopped nursing or when I said are on the head with our ... anybody could smell me long before we saw me [noise] [noise]\nIt's very hard to I mean you can create milk and recreate mother's mouth but I wanted to kind of bring a different spin to it so that is ... locked down so any time there's a word locked on obviously in an aroma chemical there's Milky ... note\nBut it's a jazz men so it's this Milky butter ... this is a natural islip called gamma do decker lack Dawn Turner fruity yeah and it a little buttery and then\nThe carnival is experience that the three character assessed policy in Denver has to kind of\nBroker peace accord between policy in Denver so this scene there's so many notes I'm In the in that section you know horse how licorice pepper met lemonade sweet bread honeybees ... taffy I mean\nThat's all in a carnival and when you go to a carnival it does feel like that you're like candied apples funnel cake so I think it really is one of the moments of levity in the book\nThe happy one was polled the he said how's everybody was into it to be made fun of the weather and what it was doing doing yelled back at the crows and was\nThe first to smell the roses\nAnd yet this under no tone of rotten roses\n... the closer the roses got to the louder the scent and everybody who attended the carnival\nAssociated it with the stench of Iraq and roses it's made them and little dizzy and very thirsty but did nothing to extinguish eagerness separate colored people filing down the road\nSo God it's like death is right there so to me the artificial rose which is not as good as the railroads I think has that kind of like overly ripe rose said where it's so good it's disgusting so that's a\nRose or through an artist yeah just where the boat so to this is the\nThe one that really made me think okay carnival rotten rovers okay this is um well white smell and told me I mean I just like to know if people think\nWhen they're ... it's more it's the most Sunni and metallic and I don't know what is\nIt tiny accord show this to me really draws into the love they'd when she comes back a as the spoiler alert I mean if you haven't read it please read it today\nIt's her obsession with sweet stuff and Hamid things for me honey milk you know mothers' milk honey rose that's the heart of the story that's the beauty of the ... it's a mother daughter story I wanted to incorporate African notes to pay Amash to the place where people were stolen from\nThe notes that I have from Africa or African bluegrass I Want you to compare that to the sweet grass the American sweet grass for oh God I Love all the grass when her ... so that's like my way of creating a little accord\nWith the sweet grass to kind of bring Americans sweet grass and African bluegrass together so then we take the salt and then he saw these three together and you're going to like that to ...\nFeeling and they're getting excited you know like okay I can I this is a perfume and feeling so then we want to\nDeep and that's because it's a little too late and break so then we want to get this led cedar [noise] shoot getting this one\nRight right ...

most salient factor that I'm going after\nIs in the energy of the bus which is goes the nest ascension and to me of rain and mud and blood going to the materials and folks that you know we are as writers are always battling with like is this getting point last you know I think\nOf course this license work will never be dead end point last but does it live on an average capacity to me this is
