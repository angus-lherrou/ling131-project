A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to us that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a retired\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important things I Love to think about is a shoney's was hunted vested on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best that I think about that long arc\nYeah yes I I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits\nOf being and acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being and acknowledge citizen of a truck\nI just want to add to that I Do think that the publicity around this is drying some resources or to North Dakota is a nonprofit some advocates some attention from donors and things who are giving to tip programs that want to organize Native Americans to get out to vote to help them get ideas if they need IDs and sell\n'em uh maybe the attention well will produce as mark has sad actually healthier turn out in the mid term election one mid term elections traditionally have lower turnout\nNow Republican North Dakota representative Kevin Cramer who you mentioned is running against senator high camp for her seat responded to the Supreme Court decision late last week during a town hall here is part of what representative Kramer says\nIt's always been concerned to me if if people who want to vote don't vote 'em as I've looked at the law it's not very complicated to vote in fact there is another place in America there where it's easier to both in the north Dakota we're the only state in the country that does not have voter registration in fact the law that North Dakota passed allows in a a tribal\nId to serve as the legitimate identification so I Would say if if I was the chairman of a tribe and was concerned about this I'd make sure that my tribal members got an idea for my tribe if they don't have a driver's license and most of them have a driver's license as well\nThat's North Dakota Republican representative Kevin Cramer speaking late last week during a town hall Cary what do you make of Kramer's comments is that and match with your reporting particularly the part about having driver's licenses and North Dakota being ... if you stay in which to vote\nWell North Dakota was lung a very easy state in which to that in fact until the first version of this law was passed a and twenty Thirteen after after that time when high camp one\nAnd twenty twelve there were a failsafe that voters didn't have id if he showed up at the polls and you didn't have ID A poll worker who knew you could actually vouch for you\nKnow ... is a small state that was something that was in play you could sign an affidavit of testing to your right to vote but those failsafe they're no longer an option for voters North Dakota is not as easy as Satan disease to me what\nDo you think is going to happen carry in this in the Senate race in for the issue at large I hate to ask you to to forecast the future but what does the trend look like what are people kind of expecting from this race\nWell if we pull out the ... I think I think it's really hard to know look it's um the polls have Kramer solidly ahead of hike camp um polls have been wrong before polls were wrong in twenty twelve and send our high camp one and I would draw your attention in North Dakota to the math\nTypically between two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand people in the ST turn out to vote in federal elections what that will be this year I'm not exactly sure at presumably on the high side for mid term but that's about the range of people were talking about so it doesn't take much to to change an election\nI mean we have to pause and just a moment but mark what are you seeing in North Dakota where do you think this has had\nWell I think this will make it a lot closer than it would have been I think it would have been very one sided election before this all happened so whether it will be enough or not for us that are kept to win re election I don't know but I think it would not have been a contest that does not happen\nAnd Simon ... Smith I Know we have to let you go momentarily but what do you see as the as the outlook for this going forward\nI think uh you know I have to agree with mark I think it's going to galvanize so many indigenous people that are going to go out there and I think that you're going to have a swell of indigenous people hitting the polls and I'm\nTelling them no you can't take my vote you know my my voice matters are voice matters where the original people of this land we're stewards of this land and you're not going to take our our rights away from us\nDo you feel more fuel Simon like this is something that's that's a a growing groundswell among Native American voters across the country this issue of voter disenfranchisement\n[noise] oh yeah most definitely and I think a especially under this this rotten administration a lot of indigenous peoples are going to come out to vote especially to get all of them out we saw how it played out with people like you know when they were trying to get Kavanaugh and then they finally got cabin ion\nAnd we're like no this is this is horrible and this is happening on our watch us indigenous people were not going to let that happen\nSome employers Smith a Chicano writer in reporter uh CNN contributor and also in a global Lakota citizen working on a book coming out next year about his experiences as a Native American in the twenty first century Simon it's been a pleasure to have you with us thanks for talking to his\nEx rather we'll continue our conversation in just a moment with more ... and Kerry levine and we still love to get to more of your questions and thoughts as well about being a Native American voter and the issues that matter to you in the mid term one a at W.
