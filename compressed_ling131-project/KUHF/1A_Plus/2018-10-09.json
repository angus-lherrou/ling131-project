circle of protection among themselves and it usually takes quite a bit\nFor officers to come together to to um from Port move someone out\nI'm Sorry what did you just elaborate on that idea in terms of being in it by themselves what do you mean by that\n[noise] so have you ... you know video has exposed the ugly underside of policing today what I mean by that if you go on YouTube today you can see a number of cases involving excessive force\nThe lack of transparency how police officers negatively interact with citizens\nThey curse at them they disrespect them they used excessive force whether it involves you know deadly force or other means the overreact and now with the you know with everyone literally has a video camera in the palm of your hands we have\nBody can we have in car cams in this these videos are surfacing one after another\nAnd we're really beginning to see what citizens have been complaining about for decades in this country regarding the abuse\nOf certain police officers are working in their communities and this is cause citizens to begin to push back\nAt alarming numbers the protests that we're seeing across the country and now police are circling the wagons and you know they're they're they're forming a circle of protection there they're behind each other and they realize that when they're out there working in the streets and some of these neighborhoods are dangerous\nQuite dangerous they realize that you know there are backup could be the the officer that uh they protected yesterday from some sort of complaint driven by siding with them so\nThere are a number of reasons why you know the police of foreign this very close knit culture of reflection among themselves which prevents officers like Van Dyke of Patrick talked about the number of complaints unsuspecting complaints that this guy's head\nAnd that is because apparently the evidence has not been there\nYou know to to sustain these complaints and what evidence am I talking about\nStatements from police officers who may be on his squad or may have witnessed something because when it comes down to it when police are investigating their own they want to believe the statements versions of their police officers before they will believe that if a citizen and that's why video is so important\nWell I'm also curious George Cordell in terms of how far up the chain these efforts to protect officers who use excessive force go I mean you had a big job dealing with San jose police department which you know San jose is the largest city in the San Francisco bay area it's a city of about a million people significantly larger than San Francisco self\nTalk about some of what you saw in that big city in terms of the impediments to getting at the root of bad policing when it shows up\nSo it it's an important first of all to understand that when you're talking about the police it's not a monolithic group there's generally the rank and file and that refers to the union and then you have the leadership that command staff and really what what controls\nWhat happens with the police department it's really the rank and file\nPolice unions are very very powerful in this country and while the power of other unions in other professions\nHas declined over the last eight and two ... two decades the power of cliche is has grown so that that I found to be not just in San jose but everywhere to be the biggest obstacle to getting police departments to\nBe more transparent and to be able to hold police officers accountable um police departments historically are resistant to any kind of oversight at all and end the attitude pretty much his look\nWe have the training we went through the academy what white the civilians have to even say what we're doing is wrong or right and they salt of that\nIs that you have police basically policing themselves in any kind of institution that places itself means that they're they are not being held accountable by those\nSays lived there impacting and any systems that police will sell a ripe for corruption and that's what's led tends to happen in law enforcement and when you have police department however that are very uh more open minded and more receptive blow receptive to having over ... rent that came to case in San jose not ... ...\n... ... we we got to pause and just a second I'm Sorry to cut you

last year to not release any body camera footage the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nBe showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd Seth wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nJudge Cornell I knew I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we could pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances ... what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this\nAnd that is the decision that the court made many years ago Graham case it basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force it much basically\nTake faith in the ... that\nThat is that's the fate of the officer so it's a very subjective standard\nWhat would a reasonable officer have\nDone it in that situation so it is not in that ... that look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing\nPolice departments are jurors have taken hold the standard\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to to charge an officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have died so it is the Supreme Court that has set this world for\nThey came to us asking us ... we forgive Jason than that and I want the world to know that you can't just go around a given people who number one didn't think they done anything wrong and who never to never asked for forgiveness Jason Van Dyke of never asked this family fought forget period at all\n[noise] Patrick I Wonder what the conversation has been like in Chicago after the verdict what the response has been I have to say personally I was surprised\nTo hear river in hunter put some distance between forgiveness and Jason Van Dyke especially based on what Christian theology says about forgiveness but I also understand like he lost a loved one how our Chicagoans talking about this particularly in terms of being able to move forward or even forgive\n[noise] well I think uh I haven't heard from a lot of people who who are willing are interested in forgiving officer Van Dyke I I mean I think it depends on who you're talking to there are\nMany in Chicago who don't believe that officer Van Dyke needs to be forgiven who think that he was putting a tough situation and did what he\nWas forced to do a even after the verdict I Believe that and there are many others who are who are glad about this verdict and and and believe that this is justice being done I I agree with you about you know the Christian beliefs in in forgiveness however as as revenue ... said right there\nUm you know officer Van Dyke has maintained that he did nothing wrong obviously there are legal reasons for that the why he would maintain that but but I it is hard to forgive someone who who is not admitting admitting fault are asking for forgiveness\nUm but no I I have heard um the Chicago is that I've talked to a who believe that officer Van Dyke you know was guilty they are they are gratified by this verdict and they believe that him spending a long time in prison it would be justice\nAaron writes when you read how the Chicago police union responded to this conviction I'd say that there's not much hope for real reform\nThey believe the conviction was wrong evidently it's okay for the police to murder someone in the course of doing their job\nRichard wrote in our inbox my nephew is a police officer who told me that they have a saying better to be tried by twelve then be carried by six presumably meaning that it's better to deal with\nThe criminal justice system than to be shot on the job new Franklin I have to pause and just a minute but could you speak to this idea\nOf the mentality of officers and this this cone of silence I mean there are officers who want corruption rooted out there's also the police union which has to speak in the larger sense protect every single officer who is a dues paying member ... how do you see this before we have to break\nYour first um just comment on what judge Cordell said about unions unions and their power\nAnd the other thing she said it was about police oversight\nAnd we need community oversight of police department and move away from police policing the police are just went and that's a whole nother story as it relates to the mentality and thought process of these officers I mean also Spalding hit it right on the head you know what she was talking about is absolutely correct\nBut I Want to say something about the officers who would come to her and speak to her and and all those officers out there who don't want this type of policing who don't want the corruption who don't want the officers like Van Dyke who have these many many complaints\nIf they were to come together their numbers are so much greater if they were to come together\nAnd and and and form a movement to move these officers out of the rank so they can be the police officers ended apartments that they want to be for their citizens\nWe wouldn't have this but if they're not capable of doing that we need community oversight of these police department so I just want to push push back on that just a little bit because\nWe're talking about the few bad apples you know the ones who do come forward like sporting did are they not also problematic in allowing this to occur\nHey Neal I'm Sorry I I I hate to cut you short we're going to pick this conversation up on the other side of this break but I Need to get through a little
