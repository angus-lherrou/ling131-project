than a year of investigation it shows that despite his claim to be a self made billionaire President Trump was the beneficiary of a vast inherited fortune much of which was shielded from taxes through a variety of questionable schemes\nNew York taxing authorities say they're reviewing the articles findings in his tweets the president does not dispute any of the facts and the article but describes it as quote a very old boring and often told hippies\nTrump complains the vast majority of the newspapers coverage of his administration has been negative echoing a charge leveled by the White House

text message dating presidential alert\nAnd Florida and California after a long campaign\nYou know as you noted it really shows the power of the fight for Fifteen lunch back in two thousand twelve by the striking fast food workers which has has transformed our national conversation in policy landscape around low pay and what workers can expect from there from their employers\nI'm In for for for Amazon if it came after as the company has come under increasing scrutiny for its employment practices\nYou know there's been the ... the the focus on how do you know a huge portion of its workforce or and so so little money they have to rely on food stamps and safety net programs at taxpayer expense to get by\nUm but in a lot of ways the challenge for Amazon will really be what it does next 'cause pay is just sort of part of what are the question's been with them there have been a lot of business press a attention focused on the condition the harsh health and safety conditions facing their work warehouse in delivery workers\nThere is a strike right now in Southern California by a warehouse into an image and trucking workers at survey Amazon and other companies\nThat have been complaints that whole foods after the acquisition by Amazon that pays gotten worse and there's really a a lot of challenging workforce issues and really I think that the next question for Amazon is how it brings its\nYou know creative disruptive power to uh to delivering you know good jobs for its workforce you know and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage is really an important first step but there there there's there are a lot of serious challenges facing the Amazon workforce\nNow Michael Saltsman you take I think more of a pro business point of view at the employment policies Institute you say that Amazon got it half right what do you mean yeah well there were\nTwo parts of Amazon's announcement in the first part was that Amazon is is raising minimum wage which is is is news in a sense because it's Amazon but it's it's actually it's not abnormal right now I mean there's there was a remarkable even article in the wall Street Journal this morning that talked about\nCompanies around the country even in states that are at the federal minimum wage and there was a distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky that was offering ten to Fifteen Percent raised in bonuses they're giving away I pads you trying to attract workers so I think a lot of this is is a symptom of of a tight labor market right now\nAnd I welcome the announcement 'cause I actually viewed as proof I'm just like announcements in the past by target by Walmart by McDonalds by Cosco um that a government mandate is not necessary in order for employees to to receive a raise and in fact if you look at the history over the last twenty or Thirty years\nThere'd been a couple of studies that have shown that it's very common for a minimum wage worker to get a raise within one to twelve months on the job\nSo that I think the part of the announcement that I was less enthusiastic about ... a decision that they're going to go lobby for increasing the federal minimum wage um which I think it's going to put their competitors who don't have a huge market cap at a disadvantage now you mentioned what might happen\nWhen Amazon lobbies at the federal level there'll be talking to senators a Sarah Senator Bernie Sanders has enjoyed putting a lot of pressure on Amazon and other employers he's accused them of being free riders in the economy like here's Bernie Sanders talking about Amazon yesterday\nWas today\nHas is the only enormously for Amazon's hundreds of thousands of employees who will be will be her around the world\nWas very close and Amazon are now leading the way\nThey're innocent Bernie Sanders says this Fifteen is great but this is about the pressure will put on other big companies\nI Would go even further than Senator Sanders and say that Amazon's announcement shit inspire people working on many other social justice issues and the black lives matter movement to the fight over the Supreme Court\nThis is a reminder that people power combined with bold passionate political leadership\nCan make a real difference in in this case it was a fight for Fifteen allied with Senator Sanders who really just kind of sound gets teeth into the ankle of the Amazon the EL and just would not let go and as recently as two weeks ago they were accusing him of being misleading and\nTrying to ... slot him away and so there are dramatic turnaround on this wage issue should be inspiring and will create massive ripple effects\nWell we've been hearing from listeners on the issue of wages Brandon writes to us on Facebook it's very satisfying to see a company provide for their employees without being forced by the government up by the way Amazon was invited to participate in today's discussion the scheduling didn't work out we hope to have them at another time\nBut Fifteen dollars an hour east two times the federal minimum wage is that really enough\nTo get by in today's booming economy share what you know with us do you earned the minimum wage how much of a difference

A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific um out instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners\nI pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul San I set the table for it's a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress in two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states huge to the seven twenty five federal minimum\n... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's boom wages is a little higher but still owe a nine dollars are lower\nUm but but uh the other ... you know there's other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raised the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollars an hour range\nOne of the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um\nIt's really become irrelevant at the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now in its ... receiving increasing attention you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there is a little snow wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rising the rising cost of living the one place where we're seeing wage growth for workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr ... and the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor insert improve improve improve paying our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\nWhat let me give a little bit of a right Huck fear on the Seattle study that Michael sided which has been widely attack for being having a deeply flawed methodology leaving out forty percent at the local workforce because they did not include companies that had multiple locations which would include the McDonalds the ... that many\nLow wage employers there's a recent study that just came out at Berkeley that looks at six studies that if all six cities\nThat have all had significant wage increases they include ... many of the ones that you just mentioned they they looked at the experience as a food processing at food servers I'm\nAnd found that all of the fear mongering about job losses um has not proved true and and wages of course has gone up so these are the arguments we hear time and time again any kind of new regulation on businesses is going to result in job losses increased prices for consumers and so forth [noise]\nTake a look at what's going on right now with the huge windfall that corporations have gotten as a result of the Republican tax cuts are they using that to lower prices or or something but positive no they're putting it into increasing the EL pay massive stock bat buyback setter inflating\nThe value of their shares and rewarding their shareholders so\nUm these are the old arguments we hear every time we're trying to have a social advancement that would be good for workers and they tend to not proved true\nOh Paul what's the best that we know now about the sweet spot look if you made the minimum wage sixty dollars an hour a lot of businesses wouldn't be able to afford that I get it but then there's there's this inflection right there's this sweet spot that the place where workers can make the most that's best for workers and put money in their pockets\nBefore you get to the point where it starts to negatively affected business and they cut ours are caught workers were have some align effect on the very workers that we would all like to help at least I presume so do we know where the sweet spot is I don't\nThink we know but ... what the evidence of Sarah's noted is is showing is that the concerns that Fifteen dollars an hour um was it was too high have the you know the the the most rigorous ... emerging new research showed that do those concerns were not well founded\nYou know the Seattle study they got a lot of attention some of the leading economists that initially taken notice of it have since I'm backed off and said they no longer find credible people like MIT is David Autor\nUh and then there's been a isn't really important new research that just come out using um it's a sort of the state of the art methodology published in the journal of labor economics which is one for a lot of plot it's looked in particular at the U.S states with the highest minimum wages and found\nNo evidence that they that uh jobs are are are are are have been hurt by a as these wages have faced in but I really think the best evidence is what we the business press in ... where we all see on the ground and the cities that are facing in these higher minimum wages you know take\nYou know New Yorker DC where we were were where the participants are right now New York is phasing it it's Fifteen dollar minimum wage Thirteen now we'll go to Fifteen on New Year's eve the restaurant industry is booming and cranes who your business is reporting\nThat the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is a is not hurting jobs and they are in fact a growing faster than ever in the ... the same is true in DC and in fact I Know where you're going to raise the tipped wage debate a little bit later but I think what's significant about DC is it's phasing it a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and\nA despite the debate over tips the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is not controversial in the restaurant industry itself is not making it you know any attempt to attack it it really\nAnd and we see the same in Los Angeles Chicago Seattle the other major cities you know low wage jobs I mean jobs in restaurants retail the sectors most affected by the minimum wage really are continuing to grow strongly and the ... the only places they're seeing real raises are where uh where were these much higher minimum wages are facing\nThe comments and questions are pouring in from listeners Jonathan emails I currently work for ten dollars an hour and with my experience Fifteen dollars an hour is closer to a fair amount it's enough to help cover hidden costs of employment like transportation\nFuel costs repair maintenance for vehicles tools closed et cetera Ryan treats you say it's common for minimum wage employee to get a raise after twelve months\nBut I work for a chain of auto parts doors and it took two years and the race was a whopping twelve cents Ryan ads the hash tag\nFight for Fifteen and Michael emails I don't buy that Amazon's decision has anything to do with altruism\nI Believe Amazon's decision had much more to do with the incredibly competitive job market and its ability to grow its job force in preparation for the holiday season if they can spin it in a way that makes them look like good guys\nWill then good for them and I think some of our guests might agree with that coming up we have a lot more of your questions and comments about labor and wages today
