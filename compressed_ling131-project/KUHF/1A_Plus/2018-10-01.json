U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page especially if the lines are jammed up but we always welcome your calls and emails at eight five five to three six one a one a professor fitzpatrick I'd like to put the temperament question to you\nAs well partly because that's part of what our audiences reacting to Helene tweeted\nAfter witnessing Brett Kavanaugh's indignant rent toward Democrats in his statement it proves to me that he is incapable of bipartisanship dust unfit for a skilled U.S Supreme court of the United states' position what do you think\nI think it was a very unusual tactic to deploy but I Do think that he had to show some indignation if these allegations are false as he says they are\nTo just sit there and calmly refute them I don't think would have been as persuasive\nTo people he tried dot com route as we know on Fox News last Monday Night and it didn't go over very well I think it went over better this time I Will say though\nEven though his opening statement I thought was pretty strong except for reference to the Clintons which I thought was totally unnecessary his ... with the senators did not go so well I think he was very defensive\nAnd not very mature frankly and how he handled himself and so I I I give him a mixed review\nI Wonder in a way if it even matter though a union in terms of the confirmation I mean I think back\nTo Clarence Thomas is hearing regarding the Anita Hill allegations which CSPAN Iran I think was the day before the Kavanaugh Ford hearing which was very instructive because\nYou know Clarence Thomas was not Tom in terms of the way he responded to Anita Hill I mean he used the word lynching twice he called it a high tech lynching and he said I'm not going to give you the wrote to Lynch me with not to hang me with to Lynch me with\nShe where they asked him did you hear professor Hill's testimony said no I'm not ... I'm not going to listen to lives and yet he was confirmed I Wonder in the scheme of things professor for its Patrick how much temperament really matters history would suggest that at the end of the day it's a piece but it may not be that big a deal\nBut I think you hit the nail on the head earlier when you said that it doesn't really change anyone's mind what goes on in these hearings everyone looks at it\nThrough a partisan lens and you know academics have studied something called implicit bias which tries to get at the prejudices that we have against other people that may not be explicit\nPrejudices or or or or things that are very um explicit in our minds and what they have found when they do these studies is that people have more prejudice\nAgainst people who have different political views than they do than people who are different races or genders than they are so political I'm bias is a very serious\nMatter and and so I think when all of us look at these hearings we just see things through our political sphere rather than maybe being neutral observers\nI Want to follow up with you on that will we continue particularly whether or not judge Kavanaugh will be able if he becomes justice have enough\nTo do the business of the Supreme Court outside a partisan lens because there are other journalists you know John Roberts among them who have made decisions that conservatives didn't dig the Obamacare decision for example and I kind of would like to get your sense of that professor for its Patrick when we come back we also want to talk about the FBI investigation many of you were asking about that like Peggy\nPeggy emailed if the FBI does not find any evidence to support Dr Ford's testimony\nAnd if it does not find any evidence the judge Kavanaugh has lied but he is not confirmed\nWill he be able to keep the job he currently has good question he's constantly on the D.C court of appeals will put that question to Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt Jeffrey Rosen of the George Washington university law school and the national constitutions center will bring in one more guest for the constant conversation and we'll get to some of your calls as well\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

A. M. U. dot org and we're taking your calls and voice mails at eight five five to three six one a one a speaking of calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line Hey David what's on your mind\nJoshua how are you\nGood what'd you think could be a hearing last week\nThe impact of the nation are you just said the impact on the nation that's a ... exactly what I Would comment on I feel that uh\nI'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made a public because it allows us as a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington worth of our politicians and how they're making decisions for us\nOr with regard to these things so I think it was very important that we all a charm man on what's going on your daughter is a A R political aspirations uh I myself\nHave a belt with alcoholism in my past ah I found a recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me I was able to hide a light drinking and to justify my drink and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending marriage ... and also at the same time admitting that they do not have a problem so\nUm I think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future\nOf all of us David how how do you think this is ...\nHow do you think this will affect the confirmation battles though I mean I hear you about these other conversations I Need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nOne particular clip saw CNN was when I'm One of the Senate session was questioning him about a an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit she personally would not comment\nIt's got to be ... it's got to be the mentality I mean these were younger um employs probably early twenties at the most\nAnd it's just and I I I couldn't get over it that they've already thrown him in jail and their eyes and even you know when I asked them if they found no evidence I say still gonna be guilty as far as they're concerned\nYou know and it's it's just sad that's like that's\nJoshua appreciate your calling in thanks very much and professor it's Patrick how to get to this idea of being tried in the in the court of public opinion\n[noise] yes and you know like I said earlier I think people tend to view these things through the their own political prior commitments and if you're a liberal you look at it and say he's guilty or conservative you look at it and you say he's innocent\nBut I Do think you raised a very important question about what the evidence Sherry standard needs to be here and it has to be something\nThat is significant enough that we do not creative process where anytime someone is nominated some person can come out of nowhere and say this happened to me forty years ago\nAnd if it can't be disproved then the nominee is rejected because then you'll see people come out of the woodwork for every nominee and I don't think we want to create that kind of process so I think we have to ask for some kind of cooperation before we deny this person his position on the court\nWe get to a few more of your comments see us in ironclad posted on our website the one eight dot org hopefully the FBI will investigate Ford story to end the ... she has to Democrats and if she lied and why she's withholding her notes and therapists records\nConstance emailed the Kavanaugh hearing is not about political party it's about class when I was growing up in the middle class Republican household and fly over country we knew that the rich kids could get away with stuff that would have landed us in juvenile court or worse\nWe also knew that because of their wealth and position these same kids would still be the leaders of our city and our state when they grew up with all their past sins forgiven it's depressing to see that nothing has changed rich kids can misbehave abominable when they're young and still wind up on the Supreme Court\nRob posted on our won a Facebook page I was very happy with flakes decision preparing to Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona it gives the country and sent it time to breathe any Democrat who wants the FBI investigation to be longer\nCan now be fully accused of parties and delay since and flakes decision was bipartisan\nThe FBI got heels investigation referring to Anita Hill done in four days so this should be wrapped up by friday Senator Flake and senator Coons of Delaware democratic senator both spoke on sixty minutes in an interview that aired yesterday Scott Kelly asked a question to Senator Flake\nThat provoked a very telling answer\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running no you're not attract a not a chance to show\nBecause politics has become too sharp\nTo ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nPart of the interview that Senator Flake gave to Scott Kelly on sixty minutes yesterday Elizabeth that's a that is telling it's kinda it's kinda sad but at the end of the day it works like that part of the bipartisanship the Senate is supposed to include worked the way it was kind of suppose do\nYes I mean let's hope so actually I Would hope that Senator Flake would be disturbed by the news that the investigation might be severely hamstring by the White House as a\nParent there is some dispute on this but a parent direction that the FBI limited as to make an interview and and those limitations make it far less of an investigation and more of a foregone conclusion and but I think that that shows that well the political lens governs when it comes to\nOur elected leaders unfortunately and I think that that professor ... actually it's a little bit wrong when he thinks that that's true for the entire nation I think that uh that person who called in about the folks that he was overhearing at dinner believing a Dr Ford\nThey believe her because they saw her and because they know from personal experiences have themselves or their loved ones that people don't come forward until they have to you and to see her emotion and our credibility was incredibly important and that's gonna affect the Supreme Court in the minds of the nation\nI didn't want to give professor fitzpatrick a chance to respond to that and will respond to
