a warming planet from going past a point of no return and what we can do about it there is what we can do but are we willing to do it\nWe're discussing it with the University of Arizona professor dying of liver men who helped contribute to this new report and Coral Davenport who covers energy and environment for the New York times you've already had quite a bit to say we got this message from Andy who was an oyster farmer in Alabama here's what end the left in our inbox\nWhen I moved here in Nineteen eighty there were Marsha ... shrimp crabs and dozens of fears no much of that has gone\nI've got my first appearance on each well it was destroyed two weeks later by Hurricane Isaac I rebuilt a lawsuit against tonight and twenty Seventeen and then again to Gordon in twenty eight team now watching my approach\nHandy thanks very much for writing in sorry to hear about what's been going on with your peers and I know that hurricane Michael is very worrisome is just about\nTo hit the Florida Panhandle so I Know that you're watching it very very closely I Wonder professor liver meant if you could speak to part of what Andy\nSaid I've seen a lot of my friends online saying the climate change and people say there's no climate change and look at these hurricanes that we've been having\n... how much should the average person be packing things like hurricane Michael directly to what we're seeing from from climate change there's still a lot we don't know about the cycles of severe weather but what do what what would you say to people like Randy who are worried about this kind of thing\nWell first of all about let's heartbreaking I Hope he does that case it Michael\nBut um we can't say that the American\nDirectly related to global warming but we can say is the ... these hurricanes are increasing at the results of global warming because all my atmosphere had no energy can hold more water so\nThe chunk says that they thought that the extreme it that whether it's harkens to or extreme rainfall all heat waves are increasing with every little bits of wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change\nAnd don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families knew what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for our family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options in just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the U.S far Joel emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hoax and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nUm cold dependent country it's it's a country that has um huge I call resources coal mining and experts call so it's not surprising to kind of see that debate um grow up there so those are ... but those are really the only two parts of the world I'm ...\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day several of you give us your give us your suggestions for what you're doing to try to fight climate change on a more individual level one member of the one a text club wrote\nI've switched Ninety percent of my light bulbs to Eli ... I installed a high efficiency furnish I've replaced my older appliances such as a washing machine drier and refrigerator with EnergyStar models are used thermal insulated curtains I recycle aggressively\nRichard emailed I've ordered my Tesla model three a few months ago my charging circuit has been installed on I'm ready for delivery\nIt cannot get here too soon no more gas\nI'm also seriously considering solar panels and the power of all to further reduce my carbon footprint that's the thing that Tesla makes that can basically take solar energy and\nPut it through your home I looked on line Richard a Tesla model three starts at forty nine thousand dollars to mature I can swing that\nBut the Chevy Volt starts at thirty four thousand Ford Fusion electric crews twenty seven five okay so slowly coming down slowly getting closer to affordability\nAnother member of our techs club message reducing carbon footprint by eating less meat\nAnother member of the text club was a little bit more despondent than that and wrote I've completely lost hope for the planet so instead of fighting climate change I've just decided not to have kids\nSo I don't ruin their lives professor liver minute what do we know about what actually makes a difference individually in fighting climate change your lots of people talk about going vegan and not eating meat any more one of our listeners asked about planting and growing more trees what is actually effective in terms of what individuals can do\n[noise] well there's a lot of individuals can do and in fact um does it come out recently drawdown but it's a man that global effectiveness as a teacher that interested in looking at the whole list um\nThought in the report we look at the feasibility and the impact of different changes and sent me a more of a ... diet can play a role that it's so neat\nYeah about ten percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the system but\nJust as important it's got Its Food waste because that's where we're putting aside about food into waste dumps Senate um rotting and chasing me saying which is not the greenhouse gas a moving towards renewable based electricity whether it think Costa ...\nIs a cost to play a big role but the one thing that a couple of people mentioned that's really important is efficiency energy efficiency\nCan go a long way towards helping us which is our missions and we've already seen that and it's something that has\nGreat potential but even if intellectual make all of that change is one of the things that the report\nPoints out is that to stay on the one point five we've got to do some other things we've got to protect and expand sorry we may need to um what we will need to develop technologies that can actually take greenhouse gases outs of the ads\nStore them all sequester them in storage so\nWe need some technology innovation as well if we're going to get to one point five and\nAnother important issue that we raise is we recognize that those changes may not happen fast enough and so one of the things we discussed in the report is what we called shoot which is where we may have to go to a high temperature\nBefore it comes back down and I think some of the people reading I report I think that that's more likely scenario and staying under one point five is to go through a sort of the peak warming so he decided to shoot period as we adopted our economies and energy systems\nGene posted on our Facebook page just back from a trip through Europe I was struck to see miles and miles of turbines in country after country and I knew my country was so far behind\nMelissa tweeted China uses more than twice as much cause us hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population good point Lewis I'd
