by by all of us\nServices for the rest of the victims will be held throughout the week Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nPresident Trump says he is considering in order to end the constitutional

constitution guarantees the right to citizenship for all children born in the U.S when pressed on whether he can change that Trump says quote there saying I can do it just with an executive order unquote\nThough it's not clear when or if Trump would issue such an order if he does it will certainly spark a legal battle the full interview hairs this weekend on ... on HBO Joel Rose NPR News\nNew group of Central American migrants is walking north from Honduras they waited across the river into southern Mexico on Monday and one person reportedly died NPR's Carrie Kahn reports this group hopes to catch up to a larger group of migrants that's walking toward the U.S border\nI think one of the factors as a simple one which is just cost if you have to have especially with with in person early voting if you have to have people manning\nPolls all throughout the day or for weeks that had an election cycle that costs money and so states that have smaller budgets or can't afford that what about\nOn a partisan level with early voting I mean I remember after\nThe election in two thousand in Florida Democrats were very very serious about making sure not only that people knew about early voting an absentee voting but that they knew what their rights were for example if you are in line when the polls closed do to get out of the line because you are entitled to vote\nHow is the different parties engaged with early voting\nWell\nIn general right it tends to be the Democrats who are more interested as you just alluded to in trying to make sure that the voting is as easy as possible for the for the most number of of people and then has to do with a\nDemographic coalition of democratic voters they more likely to be a people of of lesser means Merkel I could it be ethnic and racial minorities\nAnd maybe the most important thing is they're more likely to be young people\nAre and young people traditionally don't vote a nearly the same rates as older people they move around a lot they don't necessarily get registered they don't necessarily think about it\nAnd so it's really really important for Democrats in any election to try to make sure that there are people turn out and so they tend to be more aggressive about expanding the franchise in a variety of ways in early voting is just one of those\nAnd Judy tweeted I early voted so that I can expend my energy now to get others out to vote\nWhat just happened tweeted I live in New York state that does not have early voting I like going to vote on election day but I realize it's hard for some people and I wish my state had early voting I think America needs to make voting as easy as possible so more people will do it\nDavid is there a case to be made for voting early besides I mean we heard from Judy why she voted early so she can focus on get out the vote efforts but what what is the case for voting early as opposed to just going on election day\nMade a lot of people aren't able to go on election day right especially people who maybe have unusual types of jobs are people who can't just call off of people who can't just take the the day off\nI may not be remotely a easy for them to vote on election day and so\nUm you know giving people a window to do it I certainly increases turnout and from abroad democratic small D democratic point of view that's a good thing that the counter argument to that right is that like a campaign takes place over the course of this entire period\nAnd uh so there are things going on right up until election day that could in theory affect people's vote and so when you allow people to vote early maybe they don't take account of all of those things\nThe question from Dwayne who asked a Twitter Our early and absentee votes even counted on election day are the only ... if needed\nThat depends so um and in most cases yes they they are there are some places where a young they're really restrictive forms of of absentee voting only in other words the we're the only way that you can vote early is\nAbsentee in with a good excuse or those votes aren't necessarily going to be I counted until later if if it's close or will they will sorry I should correct myself they will all they will all be counted right right but they won't necessarily be counted on election day unless it's close\nUm however with a lot of these other states that they're counting them as they come in on their Web sites that you can go to and you can see the total is being updated regularly\nThere's another one of those reasons on election night to listen carefully to the coverage when they start giving returns because they will tell you state by state you know these are from the polls the early voting hasn't been out and yet there's a Twenty one day period where they double check like it's it's different from place to place\nThat's right and the other thing to to keep in mind and maybe this is one of the questions are going to ask me but uh we expect in most cases especially at this point\nWhen you look at the early voting numbers we expect to see a Republican advantage in those numbers a lot of Web sites have been looking at this and saying oh jeeze maybe the Democratic wave isn't coming because look the Republican numbers are a little bit stronger than the Democratic numbers but that's where you would expect to see with respect to mail votes and the earliest voters\nOne more comment from Sarah who emailed I vote early because it's such a pleasure no line easy parking any time or day I Want just easier all around\nDavid Barker is the director of the center for congressional in presidential studies at American University David thanks for talking to us as you very much for\nComing up we'll take a look at what's driving early voting in different

I Hope I'm pronouncing his last name currently eclipse Reddit reddish reddish cliff ready as a schoolteacher who used to be a Democrat has since left the party but told you that he did not want to register as a Republican here's part of what cliff reddish had to say\nI'm not about this partisanship I'm an American and it turned to the point where when I see an American flag walking driving through the street I'm like oh who was this Trump got\nAll of a sudden ... has become this thing and I'm a gifts you know whereas I ever found America [noise]\nSo I'm having this\nOf who I Believe in democracy I Believe in this partisanship\nYou know what I mean and what I Believe in is everybody should vote\nCliff reddish speaking to kill you in the public radio Michael what more can you tell us about these unaffiliated voters\nYeah uh well they're the largest group of voters in Colorado and um that's following a trend is also taking place around the country I'm young voters especially I'm half of the half of the younger voters ... uh in Colorado are unaffiliated or\nIndependent or they're not voting I'm In the same numbers as Republicans or Democrats but there are enough of them voting\nThat they're the ones who are going to decide the election and ah they're a bit of a wild card because\nUm you know in some cases they're more liberal than Democrats in some cases they are more conservative Republicans than Republicans but in in other cases you know they're they're right in the middle ... kinda like cliff is\nUm and they're frustrated I'm and I'm you know that a lot of the things that they talk about are not necessarily the issues\nUm but how divisive politics are which is what I think cliff was getting to um they talk about a frustration that the party structures are elitist\nUm that wealth and privilege or keep ordinary Americans with\nGood ideas out of Public Leadership and\nUm there's even a sense that the system itself is standing in the way of democratic participation and representation so there you know they're focused on a really the fundamentals of democracy and I think you know listening to what cliff said ... you kind of touched on that as well\nBrian ... reporters from your station spoke to folks were casting early ballots in Johnson county Kansas a suburb of Kansas City here is what you heard from sun trek Kennedy who was voting early\nI Am I what you would call I guess that conservative Christian\nI I just want to I just don't understand where we're going [laughter] you know I just said that we're going down the wrong path\nWhen you have people coming to our country illegally I mean I have no problem with the ... and we all of our parents at some point I have no problem with that\nIt's just the illegal you know taking advantage of\nThe loop holes and taking advantage of\nYou know I just don't think that's right and when it come here and then you work hard and you pay for everything yourself\nSun for Kennedy a an early voter in suburban Kansas City in Johnson county Brian do you get a sense that a one party or other is benefiting the most stores the most motivated for early voting\nI don't know if there's a a single party that's most motivated I mean when I look at a number surprisingly there\nThat there are more Republicans that have have done early voting but that would be expected in a in a state like Kansas that has more Republicans and Democrats but the number of the difference between them isn't as large as you would expect which which is quite interesting but they're they're they're definitely have been more Republicans that have turned out for early voting than than Democrats at this point\nWill continue in just a moment with Brian Grumman of cameo W public radio in Wichita Michael do you want out of K.
