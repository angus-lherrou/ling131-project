A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate really there was one more thing you want to\nJump yeah I just wanted to add to mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to this crisis at least in part\nAnd and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax a on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of that because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAnd an economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really and California is very serious about doing it\nAt the very serious about doing it you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus on and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trainer and a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point not my economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nSheriff's I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nShane Harris I Wonder what you see in terms of the strategy of White House publishing this op ed it's the first of its kind it how important really is it that it was tearing down this Medicare for all proposal and and how important is it the u._s._a. today just kind of let it run as it is you know there's there's two\nTwo thoughts on this one is there's the political lines to look through this which is the place and get in USA Today which has a huge circulation and has a lot I think probably more market penetration and places where President Trump would like to get this message across them perhaps the New York times or my paper the Washington Post\nUm so what you're seeing here was almost the tax version of a Trump rally where he will make all kinds of assertions\nA false hoods uh maybe allies regrets calls him of them lives we can dissect them and categorize them uh but but this was really I mean I think my colleagues as opposed to going Kessler who's the sort of the fact checking gold standard used that line and you mentioned that nearly every sentence contain something misleading or a fall so in that sense I think you can view this much more\nAs a political document that kind of rallying document then there comes the second question which is All right if that's the case what was the journalistic obligation of USA Today\nTo push back on days and I must say I haven't met on the editorial side I'm On the news side there's a bit of a church and state separation but if I were a media reporter I Would not\nBe that impressed by USA Today's responds to say well we give people a lot of leeway in their opinions um there is the old saying you're entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts US Senator Moynihan said ah it seemed like the leeway that USA Today was giving the president and his op ed\nJust random crashing right into the hall of what the basic fact checking is supposed to be about I'm Sorry I'm Still not quite understanding how the editors chose to go ahead and allow this to run in the form that it did and it's frankly it's a real embarrassment for USA Today\nAnd it is worth noting that on many papers you know on even on the editorial team leader or a fact checker it was like there is an editor who edits editorials to make sure\nThat they're accurate there or at least ... around and the fact absolutely you know I think Trump recognizes that this is going to be a rallying cry for the Democrats not just in the terms that looking at it had to twenty twenty\nAnd this is something that here in California US Senator Harris and is out front on talking about it on and she's actually the first person could back Senator Sanders on this last year at least publicly newsstand I gather news English running for governor and\nOn the Democratic ticket and media Italy accepted Twitter act to strike down ... comments in this ad and he talked about Trump support for the ... of allowed insurance to charge more\nFor preexisting conditions is absolutely something that gathering incentives running I he wants to government run health care system and Trump actually called him out in Montana a couple of weeks ago on this\nThing not only does news wind sat universal healthcare he also wants that to apply to undocumented immigrants had kept trying jokes he may even move here to California to get their free health care\nMore story we'd like to start getting into before we have to pause and there has to do with the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh if confirmed Saturday in fifty to forty eight Senate vote sworn in as a justice over the weekend and on Monday in a ceremonial swearing in with the justice is family by his son listen\n\nPart of the swearing in ceremony for the newest Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nIs confirmation to the Supreme Court comes after a month long battle between Democrats and Republicans over that nomination we'd like to talk more about how that confirmation\nHas resonated across the country and frankly whether this fight is over some senators are vowing to continue that fight against Kavanaugh so what would be their next move will get into that and we continue our conversation with political journalist Todd's will like Shane Harris intelligence and national security reporter for the Washington Post\nAnd little ... co host and

thoughts on the week sob stories won a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nGo it seems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nThat the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican in a red state\nActually had a a chance to buy their surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon scenes to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward to and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior\nIn high school and college uh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January they will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
