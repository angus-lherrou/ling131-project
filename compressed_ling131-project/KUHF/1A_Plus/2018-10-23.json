to a plan Saudi Arabian operation to kill the Saudi journalist ... president wretch uptight or two on alleged that ... he was murdered in Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nHe says although it's Saturday diplomatic territory it was a murder committed on Turkish soil speaking through a BBC interpreter he called on the Saudi Government for the murderers to be prosecuted in Turkey\nAnd orange coloration from them going forward on is that the old oh that is so low to the highest level will be a high likelihood will be brought to justice on we'll get a punishment they\nSaudi Arabia has made shifting claims about ... genes fate for weeks now saying he died after a fist fight in the consulate\nNational security adviser John Bolton is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin today in Moscow they're expected to discuss President Trump's intention to withdraw from a major nuclear arms treaty Matthew Bodner reports from Moscow both countries have accused each other of violating it\nBefore today's meeting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry ... said that putting in bulk and we'll discuss a wide variety of issues plaguing U.S Russia relations but after President Trump on Saturday announced that the u._s. intends to withdraw from the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty arms control is expected to dominate the agenda\nThe treaty was credited with bringing about the end of the Cold War banning an entire class of short and medium range nuclear weapons station to by both sides in Europe\nHas said yesterday that ... eager to hear both can explain some position but it is unclear that the two sides which have accused each other violations can find common ground for NPR News I'm Matthew Bodner in Moscow\nThe Supreme Court is temporarily blocking a court order that Congress secretary Wilbur Ross forgive sworn testimony in lawsuits over the new citizenship question on the twenty twenty cents as NPR's on the low long reports dozens of groups are suing the Trump Administration to get the question removed\nThis legal back and forth is leading up to the first potential trial over the citizenship question is expected to start in New York City on November fifth a lower court had allowed the plaintiffs attorney sequestering commerce secretary Wilbur Ross about his decision to add the question to the twenty twenty census\nI don't think there's anything larger behind it it's a re branding is what he did with the NAFTA agree many changed uh three cameras and a parentheses and a semi colon and then\nGave it another name and issues it again I don't know what you would change on the treaty we're talking about to make it any different or any better than it was you were actually right Joshua it takes a chunk of nuclear weapons out\nThat was the main threat to NATO in Nineteen eighty eighty one eighty to eighty three or four until the treaty was signed by President Reagan and I'm\nA Mikhail Gorbachev in the White House it's kinda funny Joshua ah when Gorbachev came to town for the signing of the IMF treaty\nThere was a banquet given in his honor and I was asked to host a table and at my table was a businessman from New York Donald Trump who had Barbara Walters was at our table to my wife said it was the only time a\nDuring the whole lunch I couldn't get a word in edgewise tried though but a Trump was talking the whole time barber authors are dying and Trump seemed to love it love the treaty and love everything about it uh so you know obviously he had no idea what it was all about and I I think probably today has no idea what it's all about\nAaron commented on our website the one eight dot org from what I have read the smartest move would have been for Trump to try to bring the Chinese into the treaty\nThat way the world will be safer and he can boast about his better deal which in that case would be true\nUnfortunately John I hate all arms control treaties Bolton has his ear and this is the result worth noting that John Bolton national security advisor he's in Moscow now meeting with the Russian government and president Vladimir Putin's there today what about this idea of bringing in\nThe Chinese they are increasingly bellicose interactions on the world stage what do you make a variance comment\nI think Aaron is absolutely right I wrote a column about um\nBoy Thirty years ago in New York Times Joshua that said we should enter nationalize the treaty in other words the United states and Russia than the Soviet Union but Soviet Russia were part of this treaty\nIt would be a wonderful idea to open it up to all countries around the world and I thought we could get a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty signatures had that happen I think the Chinese would have come in at that time but Aaron is absolutely right that today that would be a very good approach say that were prohibited from\nThis certain range of nuclear weapons the Russians are prohibited from the super this certain range and the Chinese should join us in that at least it puts pressure on them or to get\nInto the treaty and if they don't do it then it gives you some reason although not a very good one for some reason to uh eventually get out of the treaty it's a good reason to get out of the treaty if you have a program that you want to\nUm deploy a new uh some kind of device you wanted deployed to protect the country it'd venture interests there is prohibited by the treaty but there are none that I can see\nI Know we have to pause and just a moment what's what about the flip side of this I mean the end of this treaty or at least if America pulls out does that mean that it opens the door for an arms race between the U.S and China and North Korea and Russia and whoever else I mean is that the is that the immediate results are is a little more complicated than\nThat is certainly allows Russia to enter into this space in a big way and to deploy missiles that were prohibited for all these years so yes it's a opening up nuclear weapons or two more possibilities from Russia\nHow we view that as a likelihood particularly since for you to pay so much attention to North Korea right now rightly so how likely do you think it is that Russia wants to rebuild that kind of arsenal it if the street he went away\nI think very likely it's a it was a very good idea there is in the seventies to target Rome in Paris and London and Berlin uh to drive a wedge between the NATO allies in Europe and the United states\nAnd if that's their objective which it obviously is report and I think this is a great device to do it and they could do it relatively cheaply by having missiles that threatened just those countries and\nIndividually threat you know so I think it's um you know it's a good move for Russia to bad move for America\nFewer quick questions I'd love to ask you on the other side of this pause if I may we're speaking to Ken eight I'm In Ronald Reagan's arms control director and former

Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the tree\nThose are good questions uh and uh it's unclear in the constitution what Congress's role\nWould be in getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ratified by the Senate uh and uh in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump president in Nineteen eighty seven a but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty or is the president's discretion in Congress says no role in that\n[noise] can you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there is a threat from North Korea there is a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to ... closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where is where does this it\nIt's just pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against a whole class of nuclear weapons okay to me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear uh treaties and nuclear threats are\nThat are bound by trees as the nonproliferation treaty which really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons to spread\nAnd ah by and large that's been pretty successful Joshua or the fact is in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy\nThere would be twenty five nuclear weapon states by Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six seven\nAnd so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nWe will we really came out is it's never it's not what we think it is and it never has been\nWe've looked at it through these mythology and so as a consequence because we look at leaders through bird lenses withdraw bad conclusions right\nWe select the wrong people we elect to the wrong people we promote the wrong people and often we follow the wrong people all we expect unrealistic outcomes for most leaders\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a election day is just weeks away on our program we know that the election is just part of a national story that will continue to
