and sexual assault\nThe only reason was for was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the

visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of that\n[noise] so this episode like so much and are\nHighly highly polarized society um is two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode end to end to the president himself and so forth so that's their view on the the Republican view is\nMorsi in Cleveland tweeted the G O P has proven that they hate women raped culture is alive and well in that party they hijacked the process changing

voicemail but just landed in our inbox\nMy name is Logan from Nashville, Tennessee I was a two term Obama voter and slowly woke up to what I saw watch wise and are are voted for Trump this last time\nAnd I got to say that this whole Kavanaugh um debacle really this would be a second awakening for me and a lot of people I've talked to it really has been it's been ugly from both sides but uh mainly from the left and I think it's really going to swing badly for liberals in the midterm\nLogan thanks very much for calling in and Morsi also thanks for sharing your thoughts with a ...\nYeah so the caller raises an incredibly important to point that we haven't gotten to yet but that's the I'm sort of cultural moment here about the me too movement because as somebody who I I was very well disposed towards the me too movement or right from the beginning I think it's a necessary corrective\nI'm On the other hand it seems in this case to have been weaponized for political outcome\nAnd the standard that the me too movement or at least some advocates of it and the Democrats seem to want to establish is that an accusation by itself without evidence is enough to sink the man's career ruin his reputation\nAnd a lot of people are rightly recalling at that and saying that cannot be the standard yes we have to listen to women respectfully when they come forward and kill someone but that doesn't mean that accusation alone is enough\nI Wonder though if there's any way to even separate those things I mean I think about\nThat moment when Jeff Flake was on his way down the elevator remember that when I was in office buildings on the fourth floor he's trying to get the second floor and those women held the door open and they were like look at me when I'm Talking to you what do

need to register which is quick and easy to do October nine to ... to register to vote in the state of Tennessee unquote I mean\nIt just feels like the kind of thing that shows visceral that it's just designed to mobilize people to political activists\nOkay so here's the thing every piece that I've read or or testimonial that I've seen the last few weeks ago about I was raped or I was sexually assaulted therefore I Believe that Kavanaugh did this\nThat's the the the the link that's in my opinion really dangerous right because of course so many women have been victims that doesn't mean this man is guilty I've compared it to any time that you judge people by the group they belong to right\nWe're going to judge Kavanaugh because he's a man I mean we could say the same thing about you know young African American male is arrested for a bank robbery and uh\nYou know you could say well you know young African American males are just proportionately uh caught bank robbing banks so therefore this guy must be guilty that's not the way our justice system works\nOut I think you're ... I I think that the emails and the cause you reading that this is something that's absolutely going to mobilize the left and I do think that because Kavanaugh was confirmed\nAt the right may suffer from this at the ballot box however I think that Republicans will happily sacrifice ten Fifteen twenty twenty five house seats for a seat on the Supreme Court and\nThat judges are simply a winning issue for conservatives and they will happily pay a political cost to have at a justice Kavanaugh rather than a defeat a judge Kavanaugh\nBeing as I Know you want to jumping on that'll give you a chance to do that as soon as we come back I also want to talk about what this might mean for the court itself Irwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kavanaugh really took the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate\nWhat will she actually mean for the Supreme Court\nWe have a one degrees

because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that
