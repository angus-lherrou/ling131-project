A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record at HUD be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\nNo thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hug you know for years decades of\nA different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nThe problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically with taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity in their community\nAnd I'm very proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we do that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to family living in public housing dean\nTweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is hug doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary been cardio which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction\nNight you know that they are crying in some Baron detention center or so you know we can go at it either way\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nAnd we've only got you for a few more minutes let's see if we can get through a bunch more questions before you let you go\nThe baking man tweeted if secretary Castro runs for president well he tried to bring the Democratic party back to center and be a bit more moderate or will he ride an extreme left wave which is where it seems to be going at the moment\nI'm asking as a moderate let me add to that a little bit of contacts former U.S attorney general Eric Holder using Georgia just over a week ago speaking to a group of Democrats\nAnd told them it's time for Democrats to be as tough and dedicated and committed as Republicans she kinda reference that line from former first lady Michelle Obama when they go low we go high hears what Eric Holder said next ... says\nYou know when they go low we [noise]\nThey go low we [noise]\nAnd then a few minutes later he clarified saying he didn't mean Democrats needs to do anything inappropriate but I also noted if they didn't exactly gas they collapse like a lot of Democrats feel like you know of Republicans won the election by basically punching us in the face and stepping on American values you know why or why the hell are we still playing nice\nWell in the heat I I'll I'll let a kind of a turning General Holder or you know speak to what he thinks we should do um I I Would say that um\nYou do have this divide out\nThere right now amongst Democrats some who want this Michael ... style in your face give Trump what he gives us a versus folks who won a more hopeful vision for the future in a manner that I think a Brock Obama painted ten years ago\nAnd um it's understandable why folks want that you know in your face style I Do think that we have to stand up for what we believe in um we have to be very forthright and blunt I'm at the same time\nIf you look at the history of this country and you look at um the the Democrats that have prevailed in presidential elections are they painted a hopeful vision\nFor the future of the country are and so I I Believe that that is the right path ultimately\nTo comments about just your visibility your name recognition black at our tweeted I could vote for Castro might be an issue in the Cuban community in Florida different Castro's people different Castro's\nRSP sale wrote on our website I'm Glad Texas politicians are getting some of the national limelight I don't think ... and ... are the best examples for for individual roared a Democrat who's running for the U.S Senate\nIn Texas how is the name recognition game going for you just in terms of getting people to know who you are and what you're about\n[noise] uh well I mean you know my brother and I have both been active um of course in Texas but uh now across the country for the last few years\nUm if I decided to run for president I guess I'll concern myself more about that ah remember that that the president a primary is not a national election is a state by state primary and caucus election\nOn so folks need to do the hard work and Iowa New Hampshire or the other early states\nUh to to be able to do well of course raising your name id nationally and that leads to your ability to fundraise is important um but you know basically been out there I'm making sure that the folks who are going to get the clock is ah if I decide to run or that they get to know me\nOne more question I Would ask you mentioned your twin brother who is a congressman you talk a lot about him particularly in the early parts of the book and how you too where the most competitive twin brothers who ever lived there for how is having a twin affected the way you view politics\nUm that's a good question I don't think anybody's asked me the question in that way I Would just say you know uh what's interesting about being a twin is that everybody sees you the same way right like you're part of the package your in your group feel\nA package deal and I guess it's helped me to understand issues of identity and how people think about themselves in politics\nUm because I grew up and everybody saw me as part of somebody else [noise]\nLeon Castro the new book is called an unlikely journey waking up from my American Dream secretary Castro it's been a pleasure thanks for talking to us thanks for having
