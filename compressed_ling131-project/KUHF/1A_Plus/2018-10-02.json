man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words up the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist so I never want to make it about me\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nI Do want to give out a hotline number by the way if this news cycle or this conversation is kind of triggering for you it's bringing up some traumatic memories and you need someone to talk to or if you need some help here is the number for the national sexual assault hotline here this eight hundred six five six\nFor six seven three again eight hundred six five six for six seven three\nLet's get to another one of your stories before we keep doing geo emailed I'm uh forty seven year old survivor of sex trafficking I was brought into this country when I was fourteen years old from South America by US tourist I was too young to realize back then in my life was going to turn into physical and sexual exploitation\nTwo years ago the thoughts I buried so deep resurface so vividly the thoughts of killing myself were constant I recently got help with therapy and medication but what happened last week during the court hearings hurts so much as we survivors will be put down his crazy and irrational\nLorna you nodding I Would love to get your thoughts on what the Kavanaugh hearings will mean for survivors when we get to a few more comments about that 'cause we've gotten several to that effect\nCat treated as a survivor of the hardest part of the debate over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been the mocking attacking and dismissive remarks made by friends and family even as I have shared my story I have been dismissed as being emotional\nAnd another listener texted I'm a psychologist seeing clients for therapy between Wednesday and Thursday I heard two people sexual assault stories for the first time alone with their beliefs that no one would believe them if they told\nYou I also had a client return to something we talked about a year ago a domestic violence incident which are a strange abusive husband was able to convince a court was her fault\nI'm convinced that if Kavanaugh is confirmed now it will have a chilling effect on women's trying to charge men with sexual and physical salts Lauren\nThis is a really important part of the conversation so I'm as a survivor myself I had a really hard time when Clarence Thomas was a\nApproved whatever the word confirmed ran for 'em because I felt like it ... it was it was all the people in power saying to all the survivors we don't believe you and you don't matter\nUm because of that and the memories of that which I Do feel in my body that moment when when the yes vote went through I did not watch\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford's and jet Brett Kavanaugh's testimony it I just felt too unbearable to me I Do think that uh swimming that he gets confirmed or\nIt will be different not that it isn't the people in power are saying we don't believe you and you don't merit matter there is still that and it will still feel that powerful to many many survivors\nAt the same time now we're hearing hundreds of people saying me too I share your story this happened to me mine was slightly different and I'm with you and and people saying\nI have your back I Believe you so I think the cultural context while we have a long way to go has really shifted um and that progress won't be taken away\nProfessor Conan I Know we have to pause momentarily but what do you think about the possible effects on survivors of the capital confirmation process before we have to break\n[noise] I'm hoping that the effects are you know in the long term positive that the public conversation as on the other guests have said um [noise]\nHelps people to feel that they're not alone um and that at least some people have their back as even as again having even if he gets confirmed I'm I've also seen ... there's been a lot of public evidence of men coming out in support and powerful men and women um and shows like this one so\nI'm hoping that in the longer term it will be positive for sexual assault survivors generally and they'll be a sea change 'em that we'll see they'll have ripple effects on the line\nI Would love to get your sense of the rule that men play in this me too movement particularly men who have been the offenders homemade tweeted a male perspective is needed to move the needle other men need to hear from men who have been the perpetrator and why they did it\nI think some and can't get why a guy would do this to begin with and need to understand that part in order to believe the women more\nWhat role should men be playing in this meat you moment will try to get some answers to that and more in just a moment single ups\n\nHouston
