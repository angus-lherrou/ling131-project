that confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of synch show people that those you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed at that and more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences\nUm I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then you to the enemy of the people has made a
