from Dallas NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nThe legal action is the result of a four year investigation by attorneys general first or New York and that other states or whether Exxon Mobil engaged in a long running fraudulent scheme what was the village game\nIs that right well I think what you're talking about there that's how Donald Trump describes it as he received a million dollars at some point in time and he's never really narrowed down your right and we did when we were talking about the money he receive we tried to talk about that\nCohesive blur coherently like in current dollars so it wouldn't be\nConfusing um for instance he's receiving twenty thousand dollars a year from the time he's three years old today that doesn't sound like a lot but in Nineteen forty nine when that started it was the equivalent of physicians salary today that's the equivalent of two hundred thousand dollars a year so when we address those things we tried to talk about them and and current dollars just to make it clear and easy to understand but\nWith the loans that's actual like loans that were valued at that time at a million dollars it would be more than a hundred million dollars today if we look at the loans sixty million that we found sixty one million his actual at the time money\nGotcha gotcha we're seeing the two investigative reporters from the New York times\nSuzanne Craig and Russ

I think what they're talking about there is a is is inflation adjusted developed dollars\nUm and to say he's never seen it done before I think you would have had been living in a cave and never seen that done before it's in fact done every day for the reasons I described a couple of moments ago um that ... a dollar in Nineteen fifty is not the same as a dollar today\nAnd so you typically just those things are to to make it clear and and meaningful and the federal stuff that as well yeah\nI Know we have to pause in the moment but let me get to one comment charisma teams treated with respect to taxes tax avoidance is not a crime tax evasion is folks who are involved in criminal ventures evade taxes high earners like Trump avoid them and do so with the help of high priced accountants blame the system not Trump Suzanne what do you make of that tweet before we pause\nIt's it's the story looks at it\nBoth the tax avoidance that went on throughout the years with the inherited wealth that Donald Trump got but it also shows very clearly that there was a lot more than talks avoidance going on Donald Trump stepped over the line into the legality\nI'm In and we outline a number of schemes and the story I'm using you know documents both\nThat we we got from various sources including I'm Fred Trump and his empire to show that the that much of went what went on and how he inherited fortune was done through through legal means\nWe'll get into some of those schemes as we continue our conversation with Suzanne ... and ... of the New York times varying reactions from some of you to this Chris wrote on our Facebook page wow what news a rich man trying to keep his money shocking\nWe'll get some more of your questions and comments and just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from Atlanta you're listening to one a firm W.

Johnson before we get back to our discussion on the New York times investigation we want it to update you on the investigation of suspicious packages that have turned up around the country in the past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington the bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap and manila envelopes\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donors George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz lifted as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bomb that was sent to John Brennan was sent and care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional\nOf the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know now President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible\nFor these despicable act to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify\nWe have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable\nMessage that acts or threats of political violence of any kind to have no place in the United states of

tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposefully false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten
