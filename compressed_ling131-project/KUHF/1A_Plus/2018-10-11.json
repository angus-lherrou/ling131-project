in Asia plunged today following yesterday's sell off on Wall street Chinese markets plunged by five percent of Japan's Nikkei average was down nearly four percent markets in Europe continued to slide NPR's Uri Berliner says there are several reasons for the global sell off\nAmong them a technology stocks which are really propped up the market will to board the market for so long uh they've started to fall I'm as well as there are higher interest rates for all kinds of things you'll on treasury bonds are up that could make them more attractive than stocks\nUh you know people are always asking me if I'm over exaggerating the the impact of Twitter and it's like Twitter literally saved our lives that like you have to remember that in twenty four teen parents go up there was no official glide Instagram like none of that the only live streaming with like you stream and that was like people to pay to use it so\nIt sounds like Twitter was like the mechanism if you remember that the the first city that you thought ... do you remember the first city that you cite aerial footage of the protests at\nThe first city um that you saw aerial footage I I don't remember the first city you know I remember seeing it and being stunned by it but I don't remember the first city\nIt was Baltimore you didn't see any you you've never seen any arrow footage of the protests in St Louis because he declared a no fly zone immediately so I can make a killing the night and they declare enough eyes on the on the twelve so\nLike there was no way for you to see what's happening if it wasn't people who are on the ground and I think one of the things that like work to identify the media came in and you're right the language is like the riot areas like you know ... being dramatic industry and like that\nAnd then the police are like indiscriminately wild like I remember when Don Lemon got tear gas and it was one of those moments where like he was one of those people in the news that of a quid vacating about the police and he's got to be I think he's like no they the protests are right where like yes we knew we were right right or like\nYou brought up the five second rule is that people don't people don't remember that it was illegal to stay in film August September October twenty four team that if we still\nFor more than five seconds and we were arrested like that's why we marched all day not because we're not marching was like the most effective tactic like we had to march and like people forget those things and I never went on like lose sight of how fragile freedom is and that was one of the big takeaways from being in the street for the initial wave of the protests in St Louis\n[noise] we're speaking to dream a caisson his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope we got a number of voice mails from some of our listeners about you and your work Andrew in Atlanta left this in our inbox\nEd or a huge fan I'm just wanted to say how do you respond to criticism from your opponents when they say just outlandish ridiculous things like black lives matter is a terrorist organization\nI'm it's just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan and it's just as bad as neo Nazis and if you guys this fall for what happened at the Charlottesville protests like how do you guys respond to that\nAndrew thanks very much for contacting us through our app when vox pop ... what would you say the Andrew\n... so we know that that is an attempt to distract us so when we when we think about like why do we focus on black people the first thing that we can focus on the issue around police found has the violence and that doesn't mean that we don't care about the issue so I can go to a breast cancer rally and that doesn't mean that I don't care about colon cancer just means that I'm focusing on this specific issue\nIn this way why focus on black people is that we know that the disparities in the outcomes are just so bad for people of color that we fix it for black people who actually automatically fix it for everybody else that like that makes sense\nI think that the other points to like you know where the cause of the violence and things like that it's like you know when I was in the street the only violence I saw it was about to the police and like we wouldn't have been there the police and killed anybody and remember that like the problem is a problem all across the country you think about California one in a lemon gun homicides in California is actually committed by police officer that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue\nAnd there are structural resented the police never get how to cannabis you think about places like California where there's a law that says that\nLiterally any investigation of an officer the last more than a year can never resolve the discipline regardless of the outcome in Cleveland they destroy a police officer disciplinary records every two years in Maryland my home town there's a lot and said that\nAh you can find anonymous complaining it's an officer for everything except brutality so when we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you guys are bringing their pain or\nThe way I respond to his just always like ... back to what the facts aren't the second thing on the brink quickly if I had no longer and really preachy about this stuff I Want to have other people explained to me so you know when people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just given people things it's like I have some like what does a four year old have to do to earn dinner\nYou know like what is a seven year old have to do to be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner rate like I Want to hear them explain that to me like people say Mike Brown didn't have his hands up and say should my brown be dead today for supposedly Jay walking like you is that a consequential with the police you know I'm going to a lot of pain is that the police and they'll say to me\nDuring there's a lot of crime crimes you know crimes bad uh are you saying that police you never kill somebody and I say to them like tell me when the police to kill your child like your kids going to make a mistake your kids going to do something than negatively impact somebody else like what's the mistake that you'd be okay with the officer putting a bullet through your child and\nShe was like I don't know I'm like well a piano right so a part of my work is to share the cognitive bird and\nMuch more to discuss as we continue our conversation was during the cats than I Do want to talk to you more of course about the black lives matter movement particularly your role which in it I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nDidn't get arrested or got arrested and then got out and have kind of just gone on with their lives in in one way or another in the book you write that quote like all institutions policing wants to convince you that it as permanent the only way forward and is in its best form now unquote clearly you don't believe\nThat that's true there are some parts of the country that are you know ... definitely grappling with the future of policing there was the liquid McDonald's case in Chicago where a white Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted\nOf second degree murder for shooting and killing him a case we spoke about on the show recently\n... if ... what would you say to people who are generally\nSupporters of law enforcement who feel that all officers shouldn't be painted with a broad brush but who might be open to some kind of reform is there something some low hanging fruit some common ground that people across the spectrum on this issue might be able to agree on tackling first\nYear that you think about when you think about in Austin we work with the often organizes the Austin city council unanimously voted against the last version of the police union contract him one of the ways that they got that to happen is that like in Austin the contract says that an officer who's just been there for one two or three days\nAt the suspension automatically get three coded in a written repugnant reprimand\nAnd like that just doesn't make sense ... like you can love the police and still be like that's just not fair rate and Cleveland and in Chicago where their claws as I say that we destroy a police officer discipline records you can love the police and that's just not fair rate like some of this is some people's insurance is like it's just not fair that you would lose your mind if like\nIf I told you that at the school system we just delete it every bad thing that the teacher did the teachers can slap kid like there's just no consequence you'd be like that is wild but when the police still have people like oh ... that's ... that sort of crazy and again like this isn't a a you know\nPart of it too is pushing back on the premise that it's like all police officers are bad people it's like I don't know our police officers people this is a statement about the institution so when you think about\nSchool public school it's like when you look at a school where like nobody's learning it's not that you think that like every teacher in America is a bad teacher you're like what's going on like what is going on in the school districts or schools were like nobody is it a lack of investment it'd just like a lack of outcomes but like\nNobody is saying that the questions that are worthy question it's weird that like or it's odd that like with policing the moment that you say like it's not working people like oh my God you must hate everybody it's like no I'm just saying it it just isn't working like that sort of just a true thing\nUm so it's interesting where the people who sort of defend them ... immediately defensive when you're literally just asking for a modicum of accountability Ninety seven percent of the officers who are involved in\nAny killings like aren't even charge Ninety nine I convicted and like you sounded you you heard about that ... gene being killed or where the Austin just walked into his house like that I don't then it doesn't seem right to me that's like very controversial\nYeah it just doesn't seem controversial that sense of humor I you've seen the videos like I've seen the videos and and like I won't accept it that's just collateral damage of what it means to be safe\nWhile I Know we we have to pause and just a moment where might step one be in terms of reform that people across the spectrum on this might be able to agree on before we have to break\nI think it's like with the police you encountered someone with the law that like it is it is basic about fairness and we started to sing a check to police that works that you can see in your city the clauses that they just aren't fair\nSo just being more active in terms of what the basic rules are the governed policing\nYeah like it's actually really hard to find out the ... the rules that allow police officers to shoot and kill people in the cities it's like so there's some places where like officers don't have to use any escalation did or the escalation like to kill people they literally the first interaction they can shoot you that's why if that doesn't make sense you know you can love the police and stuff like that as\nWe have been spending a fair amount of time talking

of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write quote I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and trial\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote\nTalk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experience as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activists\nHe you know it's interesting uh this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk and I just haven't had like having them with the right back at so hopefully I write back\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now it's a sad and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we named him one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she can leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had that sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it as the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr any other after today and they they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we added a family and I knew would pass one would not ask for I knew\nThat we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not sad one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraint semi constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can't start imagined things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like you know be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they were seeing the writing the left is it the right has always re packaging old narrative for new time the laughter always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Houston", "day": "11"}
