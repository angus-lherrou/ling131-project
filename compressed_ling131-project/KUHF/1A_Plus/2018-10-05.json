issues that Democrats have been talking about\nThey also want to make the argument about that the but we've heard the past several weeks that the issue about his behavior in high school and college and the allegations of sexual misconduct and the third thing is that they want to focus on the unfairness of this process and the fact that he they believe that he revealed himself to be a partisan during\nThe last hearings so they are going to you're going to hear them throughout the rest of today nail on those three ideas because what they want to do is they want to remind voters that and in this midterm election coming up is their chance to make a choice about who makes these decisions who has the majority and who should be in ... in control of the house and Senate\nScott Detrow we've really seen that that temperament that partisanship argument pickup in the weeks since the hearing went when Kavanaugh was so confrontational with Democratic senators and that's one reason why\nHe had a remarkable op ed in the wall Street Journal last night saying I may have been too emotional during that time for during the confirmation hearing last week arguing he would be an impartial judge on the bench\nA he said that we couldn't quite say what was that he would have taken back I said some things I shouldn't have said they didn't specify let's return to the Senate floor where Dianne Feinstein is still speaking here and you're a little bit more of her speech\nHaitian on guns because of widespread ownership in this country\nI'm also concerned about his views on presidential power\nSpecifically he has said that sitting presidents cannot be indicted cannot be prosecuted should not be investigated and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at well\nIn other words the president of the United states is above an outside the law\nThese views raised serious concerns that should concern us all especially at a time when the president continually threatens to fire the leadership of the department of justice for failing to be loyal and raining and the Mueller investigation\nThese views alone or not sufficient for me to vote against judge Kavanaugh\nBut what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks has raised serious new concerns concerns I Believe shouldn't worry is all\nJudges are expected to be quote even handed unbiased impartial and courteous and quote however at the hearing last week\nWe saw a man filled with anger and aggression\nJudge Kavanaugh raised his voice he interrupted senators he accused of damn Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote he even went so far\nAs to say that Dr forwards allegations were nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nFilled with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote quote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and\nHow quitting\nThis behavior revealed hostility and belligerent that is on becoming a someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking\nThat more than two thousand four hundred law professors from around the country have expressed their opposition they wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the allegations that were raised\nJudge Kavanaugh responded and and in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupted and at times was disc courteous to\nDianne Feinstein of California making her arguments here before the and vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh talking about the judge's temperament\nDuring his testimony last week Nina Totenberg what are you learning about\nWhat we saw the Justice John Paul Stevens retired from the Supreme Court last night he was raised Kevin on the past said it said he'd changed his mind after he saw this performance\nI've talked to some of Kavanaugh's colleagues on the bench on both Republican appointees and democratic twenties and they were really shocked by what they call the dropping of a veil they never knew was there where\nHe talked about a conspiracy to get revenge for the Clintons because he was part of the Ken Starr investigation no evidence for that but that was his view and extended under oath\nYeah and and they never seen that and were shocked\nOkay Nina Totenberg is going to remain with us as we continue our coverage here today and let's just review very briefly where we are and then in a moment we're going to take a break and continue hearing the speeches here\nContinue hearing the speeches today\nCharles Grassley of Iowa lead off today\nAlleging that left wing groups of quote shame does all with their effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh he said that Senate investigators had been tracking down virtually all leads and that there was nothing at an FBI report we didn't already know about Brett Kavanaugh and that it's time to confirmed this man Dianne

Ninety Seventy degrees at nine o'clock\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nThere are four key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear a in their entire already over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader of the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years and was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended\nTo guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is where this year and you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is that what she would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their sides at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he\nHas done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government true when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination ultimately\nDoes not only encompassed questions of ideology or credentials\nQuestions of character\nJudge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expect and deserve\nAnd the Supreme Court justice\nHe has repeatedly misled the Senate\nAbout his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush administration\nIncluding warrantless wiretapping of American citizens or policy against torture the theft of electronic records from Democratic senators\nAnd his involvement in the nomination a very controversial judges\nFaced with credible allegations of various types of misconduct\nJudge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested\nAnd he continued to dissemble and even ... barricade\nAbout easily refuted facts\nBeyond the issue of credibility judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate\nThe bitter is partisan testimony I have ever heard\nComing from a candidate seeking the Senate's approval\nWhether they be for the bench or the executive branch\nNow there are many who think that what happened\nWhen judge Kavanaugh was Seventeen years old should not be this positive\nEven if you believe that\nHis actions at age fifty three in terms of demeanor\nAnd above all credibility should be dispositive judges at every level of the federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and morals character\nJudges at every level\nShould be judicious incredible and independent but especially especially on the Supreme Court\nI Do not see how it's possible\nFor my colleagues to say with perfect confidence\nThe judge Kavanaugh has the temperament\nTo serve on the United States Supreme court\nSo I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why judge Kavanaugh\nThere is no dictate\nThat you have to march blindly forward with a nominee\nWhen there are others available to you\nThere are many judges\nWho I Am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the court\nI remind my colleagues\nSeat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill was held by a justice who assumed the bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate\nAnd the second nominee withdrew his nomination\nBut the Republican majority\nHas press forward blindly\nOn judge Kavanaugh\nEven when brave women came forward to speak truth to power\nThat's not reason enough\nMy colleagues on the other side\nIf you have doubts about judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nAbout his ability to tell the truth\nAbout his ability to be impartial and nonpartisan\nNo matter what you think of his jurisprudence\nOr what he may or may not have done in high school and college\nYou should not vote to confirm him\nSo my friends\nDemocrat and Republican\nFor all the controversy\nAll the heavy hand in the process\nAll the hyperbole and vilification\nBoth sides\nWe can salvage some decency\nHere at the end\nIf judge Kavanaugh was rejected\nPresident Trump will select another nominee likely right of center\nProbably not to my liking\nBut without the cloud\nHangs over this nominee\nAnd we can proceed to consider that nominee and much less\nBitter much better less partisan way\nA bipartisan majority of senators considering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility\nTrustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully\nHeartbreaking testimony\nOf Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nCan vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd asked the president\nTo send the Senate\nOf the Supreme Court ended up America\nMy colleagues will do so [noise]\n\nThat's Charles Schumer the Senate minority leader and we're waiting on Mitch McConnell the majority leader next Charles Schumer making the point argument arguing the Democrats have not delayed this nomination divisions among Republicans have done so\nThose listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr actual Roger mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of ah shouted Syria both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and to be the indications are that\nA judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with\nOne of the most consequential votes\nNow the stakes are always hot for a Supreme Court nomination\nBut colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all this\nUnited States Senate will also\nBe making a shake\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying\nAnd mob intimidation\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful\nFact based deliberation\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flight\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but\nIt's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long\nFor on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been traded to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks\nJudge Kavanaugh was announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would\nPave the way to turn it\nCrowds of far left protestors\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee is going to be yeah\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against it\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nApparently you get due process only if you agree with her\nBut all of that going to end today\nAt the time has come to vote\nFor senator stands on the threshold of a golden opportunity\nWe have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well qualified and well respected jurors to oppose\nIt demands such excellent we had the opportunity to put judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court\nOr has the Segway service will make us in our nation proud\nBut we have the opportunity\nToday we're going to send a message to the American people\nSome core principles\nRemain unfettered by the partisan passions\nFacts matter\nFairness matters the presumption of innocence is ...\nThe senator started tobacco leaf thanks for the format and president but never for law\nAnd never without deep regret\nThis has to tuition does outlook back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy\nOr on any of the other times on the politics of personal destruction poison\nNo the Senate looks back on those things was shy and with a conviction that we cannot go down that road again\nWe know the Senate is better than this\nWhen all of the nation deserves better than this\nBack and farming judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this brilliant dress will be charged with upholding the rule of law and honoring American Justice\nWe must hold ourselves to that very same standard\nWe must seized a golden opportunity before us today the confirming Supreme Court justice who will make us proud and\nThe ... from our own commitment to the justice that every single\nDeserves\n[noise] as a room that's Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader the Republican leader wearing a red tie with spectacles reading from his speech\nAdjust now calling him the vote there were about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had that is what he described let's listen to the uh the action on the floor now\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Senate Seventeen senators\nAnonymous consent amount of ...\nIs there an objection\nAny action ... sent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the nomination Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the Rome history Alexander\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while uh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here or Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been saying all morning that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today\nPeople just joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voted yes isn't that a guess\nThat is usually the case but there are lots of moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind that the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last year round\nCare because we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still vote against the nominee if you should want to do that there is one ah let's give a listen actually to some of what Susan Collins has been saying today she spoke briefly to reporters off the Senate floor\nI Will be voting yes on the head that final confirmation vote and ... may influence and signed how to vote later kidnapped\nAnd uh you hear everyone tried to get one more question there Susan Collins leaving us in suspense for a few more hours another person on that list of for Joe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia a Scott has he been paying attention to those speeches this morning\nHe's been paying very close attention we know that Joe mansion spent more than an hour and that secure room in the Senate today rereading that report he went to the Senate floor not necessarily giving away his hands on how will vote but we are seeing that just now one of those undecided senators Jeff Flake did appear to vote I on cloture\nAgain that may not necessarily be his final vote but we know that flake was initially inclined to to support judge Kavanaugh before he changed his mind last\nI'm just mentioned either way mentioned by the way we went to the hearings and sat there for hours\nAnd Fred cabinet and just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes disadvantages too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short or they are still one vote short that as the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing out in announcing their votes which very rarely happen to live the United states\nGive a listen to some of that\nThis bring that up and give a listen Maria and\nMissed Murkowski\nMr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... voted to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move for Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination\nFor Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless your social listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killers\nMr Van Hollen\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is I Know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sent the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay de telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd Chris Coons of Delaware as he got into Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been er and everyone is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "05"}
