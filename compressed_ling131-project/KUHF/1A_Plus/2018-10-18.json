McDermott glad to hear from some of you about the big issues that have got your attention for the midterms\nJordan is in Auburn New Hampshire Jordan writes I Am absolutely voting as a New Hampshire residents social and economic policy matters a lot but my biggest fear and what I really want my vote to do is save the planet from a literal ecological destruction climate change and other eagle matters will hurt us more than people think\nLaura tweeted my biggest concern about the mid term elections to re establish some sort of balance of power nobody wins when only one side is represented I Would like to say I'm voting for bipartisan candidates but there aren't very many out there\nAnd Chris wrote on our Facebook page I've already voted as early voting started today in North Carolina poll workers revealed to me that they're happy we're having many early voting days as they would never be able to accommodate everyone voting on the same day November ...\nCasey give us a sense of what New Hampshire is like politically for those who've never been here in what ways does it reflects other parts of the country and what we've New Hampshire really unique\nI think New Hampshire it's really a true purple state we sent an all democratic into all female delegation to Congress which I Believe was the first for the state a Republican controlled every branch of government at the state level some of that can be chopped up to gerrymandering but I think it also just reflects the kind of\nA voting patterns that exist and the true you know kind of live free or die independents that a lot of New Hampshire residents like to think that they have\nIn fact independents are the largest voting bloc in the state they make up about forty percent of registered voters as of the latest tally so that can contribute to some unpredictability in election results and also can contribute to candidates who\nOften are on perhaps less extreme as you might see in other places towards one end up the political spectrum or the other\nI Know we've got to let you go in a moment but Casey what is the polling look right look like right now for the congressional race\nSo there's not a ton of polling here so we have very little to go on but as a medical sad boats congressional races are looking like they are leaning toward the Democrats right now that said obviously a lot can change between now and election day\nSo it it you know for that reason and also for the reason that I outlined given the uh the political makeup of the state it could be you know could turn out differently\nWhat does it seem like who's going to make the difference these national issues or more local issues\nI think a local issues I think New Hampshire is really a state where people are very plugged in politically to what's going on at the state house what's going on at their local town government a lot of the candidates while they will reference what's happening in the national landscape and I think are increasingly doing that in New Hampshire I'm at the end of the day people are really voting about what's going on in their backyard\nSo far people up about say Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump isn't a hundred percent effective\nCorrect and I think people are are concerned with issues like the opioid crisis issues like health care issues like the economy taxes New Hampshire either unique tax structure here so that you know can be very ... influence on people's voting patterns of\nJaycee McDermott covers politics and policy for New Hampshire public radio Casey thanks for talking to thanks

H. M. U. dot org the minute I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off you\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that is higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nAs Josh said this is news eighty eight seven hello I Am also Joshua Joshua Adams executive director of operations here you know in our fault fundraiser is one of the few times each year we can come to the public and ask for financial support\nThe money you invest in fact based journalism from MPR and the news that he had seven newsroom pays back every single day because of this community has a resource devoted to keeping Houston well informed tribes ... is with me was more on why it's such a
