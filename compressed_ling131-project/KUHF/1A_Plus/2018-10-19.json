I mean it's it's a massive issue I mean here this could be ah the close is a race in recent history it's a dog to buy these allegations of vote or is being cut from the ... um mostly talked about keeping more than fifty thousand mostly black residents off the rolls [noise]\nYou know the the camp says that he can be impartial and he points to other um other secretaries of state who have overseen um elections but\nYou know the sources that we have spoken to and we've covered this um say that look this is just a matter of common sense it is so close it is so important that he should be considered risky using himself\nI'm from overseeing this such a critical election airs too much at stake um but he seems to be fighting fighting that um and we'll see what happens I I this this is an issue that we will continue to see for the next several weeks\nAnd just to be clear of Stacey Abrams will become America's first black female governor not just Georgia's first if she wins Alexander I know we have to pause momentarily but this race\nSeems to be pretty close ... what happens if this comes down to a few hundred votes then you've got the official who oversees elections trying to I presume keep some reasonable distance in determining whether he wins the election he is in\n[noise] yeah I mean that's a legal fight that could go on for weeks if we're at the point where it's close enough that we're seeing a recount and I was speaking with and I'm sort of election protection officials ... yesterday he said that Georgia is their top priority\nThey're training you know hundreds of lawyers to be on the ground in that state watching the polls making sure that nothing happens on on sort of election day\nAnd then beyond they are preparing for a protracted fight over that race because you know it's expected to come down to a couple of hundred that\nMuch more to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup with Frank or don't use a McClatchy Alexander Jaffe of vice news tonight on HBO\nAnd Josh Rogers of New Hampshire public radio also we want to talk about the Senate race in Texas ... between Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz will get some more stories from the midterms and also talk about above loved American retailer facing a tougher natural future and saying goodbye to a Microsoft founder\nI'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from Concord New Hampshire you're listening to one egg from W.

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren release this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing this story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixth in election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in front of the arguments that split fires up his base and that's what's been had success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the higher ed still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nWhat area will just go ahead for them it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll give\nYou the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the gift so they brought up\nA typically these would be
