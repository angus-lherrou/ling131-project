you where you can pause yeah you can hit pause and Hong Kong and then say okay now will do an approach in a crowd and you're suddenly you're on the other side of the world\nOkay of of all the um airport you could program on your simulator which one would you want to do several times because it's more challenging than the rest because I remember Hong Kong the old airport in Hong Kong used to be appear that went right on the water and your bank around the city and it just seemed frightening every time I landed there and now they've got a bigger airport I think\nI Would take my airport that way by the views actually I think God Capetown you're coming in over the ocean and you see table mountain in the sun is coming up it's one of my favorite airports whether in simulator or in the real airplane it's a it's a very special place\nReally airports are not more challenging than others I mean if it's an airport it's it's relatively straightforward if you know what you're doing\nThe way that they very is is essentially what the weather and of course the the the proximity of hills and other airports that sort of thing but you know the weather is of course the main thing and if you're coming to Chicago in the winter you're going to have a different now whether experience than in Singapore in the summer and so\nOf course the weather is something we'll talk about in great detail before we depart you know thinking ahead as to what kind of conditions will expect to find when we got there\nThis is travel with Rick Steves you're talking with mark ... with a pilot [noise]\nIt's so fun to be able to fly around the world and enjoy the the travel dimension of it when you're a pilot are there any airport that that that sort of near their societies is being\nJust really different I can imagine flying into\nNorth Korea or something like this\nWhat airport you really you strike you as from another planet the way they're running can\nExperience and landing there\nBoth for taking at places where the airport says something about the the place that it serves I guess the best answer to that for me it was the time I flew to Honolulu as a passenger and you know I'd never been to Hawaii before and it was in the winter I I saw in Boston where it\nWas you know I see and snowy and the terminal there doesn't have ... ... it's open air and I thought what an amazing thing that is that you could you know what does that say about this place that you can you know in the weather year round that you could have a terminal that didn't have your windows that had that was open to that\nThat was open to the reason it smelled amazing you know after the winter Boston you just you just smell the sea and\nSee how salsa and this warm breeze coming through and I thought wow this is

experience [noise]\nA mark when you're writing your book you talked about place leg as opposed to jetlag\nHopeless like us the best term I could come up with for\nThat sense of wonder and amazement which is you know something well beyond culture shock when you travel across the world the way we can now in the long haul airliner\nIf you take off from Heathrow and you're flying to Tokyo and and you fly over you take off in the sun goes down and it's dark and you're flying over Russia for hours and hours and the sun comes up and you're looking out at sea of Japan\nAnd you know you had the

terminal and you're suddenly in this\nIn this whole other world that was going on and would be going on if you haven't come in there and the sense that the whole world is going on at once and that you can planes can take you into these moments that you\nYou know I Would absolutely the wilderness who are you are not very distant ancestors\nTo me it's it's very analogous to chat life because it's almost like that it would've been easier to make those journeys conceptually if it took us six months by sea uh you know a hundred and fifty years ago and now we can do it so quickly that that maybe our our sense of place a lags behind and\nAnd maybe that's a good thing maybe reminds us of how amazing it is to travel and how amazing the machines are the mecca possible\nThis travel with Rick
