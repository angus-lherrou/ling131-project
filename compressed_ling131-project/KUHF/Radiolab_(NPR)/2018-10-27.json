Arizona is another one that's really worth a good visit especially if you follow the old senator highway from Prescott, Arizona ... you can get a time capsule feel\nYou wrote a book vulture city in Arizona also\nYeah voters city is a lot of fun just outside a wiccan Berg up they've preserved it quite well it's a privately owned and they've are preserved a lot of the buildings in a sort of a rusted state of decay\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Jim Hinckley in his book is\nGhost town on the west point Jim thumbing through this for a lot of research travel that when this all over the last what was it like researching these ghost towns and how did you know where to go and uh what were some of the most enjoyable or exciting discovery she made this book\nReally was a the research has been going on for about fifty years with this book I started as a kid or here in Arizona visiting some of these places where the old timers and kind of getting first hand information of these places\nAnd the rest of it's been researched and getting to know people like Bob ... bell was true west magazine and archivist state archives and small town museum\nSlipped one thing to find something in an archive but it's another thing to actually walk up to a dusty street and I'm just looking at the the photograph on the cover of your book and just\nBe there and there's just tumble weeds and the wind and and no people anywhere recount for us a moment in your research where you just that while this is just really exceptional\nSenator highway going up to a crowned king there's a place back then senator highway and what your data this or Arizona it would be a territorial highway from the Eighteen seventies and it's a dirt road it's about forty miles takes about a four to five hours to travel\nAnd you're following this old highway and you come around the corner and here's a true story stage station was the palace station and I found out that had a real colorful transitional history it was a hotel and end stage station and Eighteen seventies\nBut they were running stage coaches down this road as late as Nineteen Fifteen and as a result they also had an automobile repair facility at this location at one time and I found that transition really I'm quite fascinating\nYou know in Europe there's a a number of places that have recognized I'm a dying culture and they've preserved it with a little um video biographies of people telling their own story and you get to see them and hear their voices\nIs there any museum that you think is particularly good that gives us a sense of the the real humanity of the Old West\nYeah the gold king mine up and Jerome, Arizona Mr Roberts and just passed away recently but his family is carrying it on he preserved a lot of this year the operating saw mills or from the late Nineteen century a lot of originally equipment that he would fire up and show you how it worked\nAnd his family still does that then produced a yes so it sounds like if you want to go to one state to see goes down to some like Arizona as the state\nWell my favorite is a New Mexico the reason for New Mexico is because the ghost towns there are really old you will find ghost towns like um San jose in Mexico um I think there's ten people left\nIt dates to about Seventeen Ninety so little church there was built in Eighteen twenty six and its cast a shadow over the Santa Fe trail the national trails wrote Andrew sixty six\n... and also you write about lake valley in New Mexico\nLake valley is an amazing place or the bridal chamber to this date that is the richest silver deposit ever discovered while the silver was so pure they were they were literally melting it off the walls with their lanterns they're mining\nLaying there must have been gone crazy now that was back in the Eighteen eighties right\nUh yeah the late Eighteen eighties the whole black range there was a lake valley Hillsboro in Kingston all real boom towns but that bridal chamber in lake valley was the richest silver deposit ever discovered\nAnd the word of that must have traveled like wildfire back in those days\nIt did and it brought in all the speculators and are honest people as well but it's it's sparked things one fella down near Shakespeare to Mexico he got the idea that they were doing so well north he's salted the area with diamonds and sold the claims made himself a small fortune\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking to a gym including the author of ghost towns and the rest were learning a little bit of wisdom of the Old West let's just close with a with a thought if you were hosting a European tourists traveling around the United states\nHad some appetite for understanding the wild west where would you take him for just a real living to infant taste of our nation\nWild west history [noise]\nProbably ... ... it kinda stretches the point of ghost town but it's become more of an artist colony but just so much that remains there and the people are passionate they preserved things it's a really dynamic in one place in a very scenic location\nIs be Arizona alright hey Jim Hensley thanks so much and congratulations on your book goes down the west thank you\n[noise] gym shares an Old West coast legend in a website extra to this week's show at Rick Steves dot com slash

they say you'll never forget someone if you write a song about the Irish remember the events and the pizza shape their history and the many traditional\nSongs written over the [noise] for America look at some of the heroes of Ireland some real in some legendary we're joined now by singer taffy Ryan cat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of public environment\nShe's with us right now in travel with Rick Steves to introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remember and it's a cat he's so good to have you here\nIt is great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of lights in the context of Ireland ... music\nTies in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes a Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl gets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous and my mother was a musician as harsh so she always had music on the stereo playing chopping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down\nAnd also we were members of the gate of the league and the Irish American tub in downtown Detroit and that was our community that was where we socialize and so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's uh it's got a very very strong Irish population had a bit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off\nEverything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit it boy the spirits of the Irish have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living in other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive around Ireland as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus throw me off the bus\nBut yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say and now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about\nYou know winning race dogs their songs about greed horses there are songs about people's families there are songs about death in communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nAnd heartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began to be a relationship with England and uh just\nTough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell you were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how everyone's going to be managed by its own people\nWell we don't like to think that we're ... we like to think we're all heroes\n[laughter] so most\nOf the Irish songs about villains are song from the point of view of the person who's trying to overcome whatever obstacle the villain is putting in its path and then you have just some really dark songs like when you when you lie yeah which is a song you learn as a child in Ireland and it's absolutely horrific\nBut it's done in such a variety me sing song you way that it's actually enjoyable to sing you want to hear a bit of that\nReally really well yes yes yes I was\nThere was an old woman who lived in the woods we all know there was a no woman who lived in the woods down and I never have our saw he or she had a baby three months old we we allow\nAny way it goes on and on and and the baby doesn't farewell nor has she [laughter] so so there's a there's a little bit of fun and yet in the stories in the absolute sacrilegious motherhood and this song you know and that's one thing I Love about the Irish they're very irreverent\nYou know there's so much we talked about but I just want to finish off by talking about something that as a musician you must frankly it's kind of tired of people are furious Danny Boy a but it's such a hit with travelers and it's always a cure jerk or when you hear it especially with Americans trying to connect with her Irish heritage\nHelp us a little bit with the lyrics of Benny boy and and what it means to an Irish musician outside of tourism\nThere are a lot of Irish musicians who wouldn't do Danny Boy because it's been so commercialized but I think it's a very important song someone once said to me it Shakespeare and I think that's true after the great hunger when people would leave the country they would wake them because they would never see them again and songs like Danny\nBoy wake them made with the way if you'd like they've died yes in the person would be there in the end of it with a data and they're leaving Ireland forever the world was a much bigger\nPlace than and they would go by sea I wasn't always safe and they would send money home usually but they've very rarely in the early days in Eighteen hundreds got home\nThat's all changed now of course but Danny Boy it to me I Love as a mother because it is letting your child to go\nIt is detaching from them with love and saying look I Know you might and come back and I may be gone when you come back but I Know you love me and that is a huge gift to give a child when they have to go\nSo now when I hear Danny Boy I have a little better context single ... single sometimes with any more [noise] whole and need\nPull\nThe pie I saw a\nCall and hang\nFrom ... to go mountain\nI\n[noise] the ... oh\nI Know the knees a fall oh ...\nCheese cheese huge most\nCoal and die must I he well that's\nWhy I'm not seeing\n[noise] oh I don't\nKnow\nWhy you know oh\nJeeze the\n\nShow oh\nOh God need poli me oh\nKnow oh you oh\nWell thank you I've heard that song so many times but I didn't know what the context Cathy thank you so much best wishes and sharing both your love of music and your love Ireland thank you for allowing me

he\nHas the official reports clean [noise] journalist Carl Hoffman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller the Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one up\nAnd we traced rocket covers during combed through our times and interviewed ... witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about [noise] Savage Harvest a tale of chemicals colonialism and Michael Rockefeller's tragic quest\nCarl good to have you back on the show thanks so much so that I said that rocket tell her story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean a Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and went off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of\nPrimitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were incredible ...\nAnd he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art which he did he made a quick\nTo sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip pie banished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one in your studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around our\nYou know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nHe was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture and as Matt carving I mean you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high poles kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it and I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was\nWealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island owned them between Thailand in Indonesia is one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nAt the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he
