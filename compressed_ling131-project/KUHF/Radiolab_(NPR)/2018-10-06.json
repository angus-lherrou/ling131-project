walking up steep mountain roads in bamboo force\nThat was one thing that I was sort of challenged by when I was in Japan to try to find a place it truly was off the beaten path because\nIt's a highly developed country with a with a dense population but in your experience are there ways to find places where the old fashioned lifestyle instill surviving\nYes ah one place I recommend the islands of

between American and Japanese culture all her life and is the author of the moon guy\nCalled living abroad Japan Ruthie also host spike tours of ... a website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace hop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she do has to do with sacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be shouldn't do it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it in her ... plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred or so but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionary such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody accept Christianity and exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do that sometime nor the gods before me or or this sort of a rite exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would that's right they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what his Hindu as them and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way up the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of nature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock and the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so\nNever had any problems everybody was more than willing to help us even though they couldn't understand them they couldn't understand that\nSounds like a good time thanks for your coat on ya Bye bye [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves have been talking with Ruth you can ag her book is living abroad Japan\nRuth you can tell I've got an interest in a Japanese eating I think I'd be the way to eating in Japan better than any place have been on this planet and it's just fun I'm not saying it's the finest cuisine I'm just saying\nEvery meal was an adventure I just you know we enjoyed it uh\nI even going on the the bullet train the ... and I remember the what's the little box to breakfast called the uh keep into bent though is uh keeping keeping though and it's just this delightful little creation of I used to make both with airplanes and it was just like a ball so would\nCompartmentalized wonderland of delightful Morris loose you can enjoy with your chopsticks and yeah just sitting on this futuristic bullet train enjoying your your boxed lunch and surrounded by all the wonders of Japan and they just going life is good what is what is your favorite eating experience in Japan\nWell I Do enjoy buying the bend tools at train stations to eat on the train or if you don't have time the lady with the cart comes through the whole yeah the train cars to sell things so you can get Huck Huck coffee or ice cream they think convenience\nSeriously I think you know yeah a lot of convenience and they're eating\nI I think you'll never go hungry that as a Japan because there's food available on many places\nI Would say one of my favorites is going to is a ... which is like a pub or you order small dishes like topped bus almost and grilled fish or nice um vegetables things like that then you have a drink and usually go with a group of friends so yeah it's very social\nI always say be a cultural chameleon you know you just got to physically more to the country you're in one great thing about a Japan I got to say I I never feel like a psyche here and in the United states but when I'm In a in a hotel in Japan there's usually a stocky machine down the hall and it's it's heated Psaki isn't\nRight socket and beer sometimes even was highly machine how does\nThat mean and it's just it's a nice way to cap a day\nThis has been so much fun talking with you about Japan and if you could just your your book is about living abroad in Japan was jammed with an idea about how you might change if you choose to live in Japan\nIf you're a foreigner and Japan and you might notice the Japanese people are more modest and reserved in public they don't usually talk loudly they also notice the needs of other people so if you're on the train or walking down the street and you need help as you've mentioned already Rick\nSomebody will stop and help you I think even my body language changes when I go to Japan that is I'm not flailing my arms and hands around so much in speaking in a loud voice\nI'm you kind of pay attention to people around you and and that exactly copy them though but you respect you picking yes respect and and children are trained that way at home and in in kindergarten you know there's something\nAbout Japan that is contagious a in a beautiful way and it almost sounds cartoonish but I found when I was in Japan I Would start you know people kind of ... just about a little bit as any almost yes you almost turned around and you're back out of the room with little ... and it's not a\nCaricature it's just a respectful mannerism and you find yourself\nEnjoying taking off your shoes when you come in and and seeing all the nice words and and blowing a lot in class upping your hands politically together and it's just a contagious beauty of Japanese culture\nOne thing I really miss when I come back to the states is when you go into a store or restaurant bank or post office there is no greeting but in Japan anytime you walk into a bank or post office or store they welcome you in unison ... welcome\nAnd when you leave they all say ... and when you get used to that and then you come home to the U.S and you go in the post office or bank or store\nNobody says that in ... I kind of miss that\nIt's more than just one person that sort of an almost an organized group Horace\nThe interior were laid out his together you almost feel like you're in a musical\nRight so they notice every customer that comes through the door whether you're washing dishes or serving food or cooking you had one of my one year almost on the front door and so when the customer comes in you automatically everyone just says eat our shame on us and make you feel welcome\nWell Ruth you couldn't get I guess I I just got to say ... to for your book living abroad in Japan the wait 'til she
