is a Sears kit the best way these days is to consult one of the many websites and Facebook groups devoted to them it's unknown exactly how many kids were sold or how many are still standing there is no official list\nThe mid west has a real hotbed for them but certain found a handful in Texas and there are surely many more that remain undiscovered so to speak\nAnd homes are like roaches if you

started losing money in the thirties and indoor plumbing and electricity made home building more complicated\nBy Nineteen forty Sears was out of the ... house business but certain things that most of the Sears homes that were built are still around the reason is a cliche but it's one that applies here they just don't make 'em like they used to\nThe quality of building materials and Sears homes far surpasses most of the stuff even of the day and certainly the things that are built today\nThat quality is evident and we'll and petty Moore's house in Georgetown just north of Austin where they live

grew on them as they fixed it up they decided to move in and said\nIn our vernacular the word kids didn't notes you know they're not very well and not very solid thing or you know something was a kid and that can't be applied to Sears kit homes\nWhen you step inside the house has a wide open feel to it with windows everywhere and the living room dining room separated by dark wood columns\nIt's gone through some changes over the years like many interior codes of paint wall to wall shed carpeting and the addition of another bathroom in a laundry room but the mores have made sure that from the curb it looks like it did back in Nineteen fourteen they even got the feel of approval from some of the homes former tenants\nThere was a guy born in the house in the front room in two thousand and six when we bought the house he was still alive and he came to visit it was\nIt was pretty emotional for sitting at the table over there and then we did walk through but his sister came and kind of\nKind of gave her blessing\nThere are little signs of the houses history all over\nOnce when will was doing some work on the back of the house had to pull some siding off of an outside law\nWhen we took the siding off we found\nTwo signatures from Nineteen forty and we determined that they were probably the people\nThat built the house after they found those signatures petty decided to make her mark to\nUnderwood behind the sheet rock and the laundry room she read her name and said that this is where she did her ironing for them to think about the future owners might find it we are the current caregivers is is what it amounts to the house\nIs the mainstay we're just training since\nSo petty signature will sit on a tight dense board kneeled over a century ago just waiting to be
