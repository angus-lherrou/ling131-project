{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "But in any case he got up into the mid fifties and here we have fifty one it's not the final vote but it's hard to see on the final vote this going much higher than fifty one\nVery hot and we know ah in fact we don't know that he'll get fifty one absolutely because senators can vote differently on the final measure in a moment I'm hoping to go outside of the United states Capitol and hear what the response has been to protesters at this news as I'm sure the news is spreading very rapidly outside the United states Capitol\nAh I'd like to ask Ron Elving about having having studied the history of all this is you have what your senses of this moment [noise]\nOne moment at this one thought at this particular moment is that those ten senators we were just mentioning who are Democrats running in states Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen nine of the ten\nHave voted against cloture Joe mansion was the lone a Democrat to vote for cloture and he is one of those ten even though it is also necessary to say that he seems not to be in as much trouble as some of the other is he seems to be on his way to re election but he did not want to be apparently the Democrat who made it a tie vote\nTo be the corresponding a vote to that would have forced Mike Pence to break\nThat particular time but in her story in terms of this is quite unusual because until last year if you had\nFifty one or forty nine votes in this case\nAgainst culture you did not get cloture votes right used to be you hadn't had sixty votes and and when we talk about Mitch McConnell and his ... significant maneuverings over the years\nNone is more important than his decision to change the filibuster rules so that it would apply that that the filibuster would not apply or not be usable when we came to Supreme Court nominees you change that last year for Neil Gorsuch and now of course it's still in place\nI Want to take notice something that you just said there Ron Elving because you said that there are ten Democrats who are seen as vulnerable who are in states that voted for Donald Trump who might see some advantage and voting for the Supreme Court nominee and nine of them chose to vote no and the one who did choose to vote yes seemed to have an option he could have voted no but he decided that he wanted to vote\nYes we presume that so many of these lawmakers so much of the time or making shameless short term political calculations uh [laughter] the evidence is overwhelming that that is very often drew and yet it is not necessarily always true and we heard just yesterday Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nWho is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to a defeat who chose to vote no announced or no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nWhich I knew and when she said what she said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way it's just too I've known to many other women like this\nAnd and she is behind in North Dakota by a smile out as much as you mentioned is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck she also chose to vote no\nAnd a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right and you know I think that's I think he got three democratic votes\nAnd um and it was assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee even if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh his until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd and so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think by\nWhat the Republican for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president of the United states admitted that she was a credible with yeah feel they decided\nTo let them read Kavanaugh's performance which he\nSort of kinda apologize for in the wall Street Journal editorial that performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both\nSchumer and\nMcConnell set in their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true for the country for the Senate for the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it devolved at the end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states and its standing\nWhich is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United\nWell let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh's testimony as the bitter wrist partisan testimony in memory\nHe said that this was a nominee or had hard right conservative George jurisprudence and then the dam broke there were questions about\nIm according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school a completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying that\nHidden sinister meanings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great indignity\nThat there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had and it's a vote that went for Kevin ... this is special coverage from NPR

well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving has covered politics for very long time as well\nGood morning to you both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kevin gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court that would've been a with a different nominee or than it was before he can't\nWell I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced and that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to and to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe don't even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nNow the second largest school district in Texas is considering an option which the president of the Dallas I as the school board describes as as close as you can get thermonuclear war and the school business namely mass school closures\nEven Maria ... is an education reporter for the Dallas Morning news she has the story and she joins us now even Marie thanks for speaking\nWith us so much extra standard hey thanks for having now this plan as I understand it was all talk now nothing set in stone a but what exactly are they talking about doing mass school closures what does that mean\nWell right now they're looking at how to plan for the future how they went to attract students back to the district and that includes building some nice school programs\nBut at the same time they're looking at how to how do they balance in Rome and issues that they have they have a number of schools that have low in romance may be you know fifty percent full so they're looking at how to best balance that and potentially close up to twenty two schools\nOr tell us a little bit about this issue that the Dallas ISD faces in terms of attrition of of of students what's going on\n[noise] well it's a it's a problem that's not uncommon in many urban areas you have families that are moving to the suburbs or you have families that are making other choices and in Dallas\nMany families are choosing to go to charter schools have about thirty four thousand kids who live in the ice sheet boundaries ... charter schools\nAnd that isn't spread out evenly among the district that's mostly concentrated in the southern part of Dallas so you have a number of campuses and that area that aren't being utilized\nSo if if they are considering the possibility of mashed school closures what does mass mean in this context how many schools might actually be closed if they decide to go this route\n[noise] the initial plan looks at closing maybe twenty two schools wow now that is far from final the trustees have to talk about it and look at what the logistics are\nYou are ready they're saying OK well some of this doesn't make sense you have kids that would be crossing you know very busy street or even start route tracks a light rail tracks so those are options that they know off the bat that they don't want to consider\nBut you know a mess just ease agreed that there's going to be some top talks ahead to try and figure out what exactly they do need to do\nWe've heard a school districts like Houston I asked you in Austin ISD ah consider large school consolidation in the past is this something that Dallas has been mulling over for a while\nYes this is an unusual Dallas recently closed a handful of schools going into the school year and in two thousand twelve a Dallas also closed a nearly a dozen schools\nWow a so there's another issue I suppose we should also mention here in and it goes beyond just the numbers of students attending it's that you have a lot of schools that are getting rather long in the tooth\nYes the average age of schools in Dallas ice tea it's about fifty one point seven years almost fifty two years and nationwide that looks more like forty four years\nSo it you know they need to do some ... separate and the need to do some upgrades some technology so they're also looking at how to replace him schools and build some schools\nAre obviously they're trying to save some money here but this is going to cost a lot of money too I Would imagine\nThey're looking to maybe pumped in about one to two billion dollars for a new facility needs to try and open up some new schools and revamp them but they're hoping that that in the long run they can save some money\nFor operations costs by consolidating utilities and campus leadership and things of that nature\nEven Maria ... is following the story is education reporter

first quarter\nWhat was behind that quick start well\nTurns out it was a bit of grid iron should cane hurry on an epic scale here to tell us more Jake Trotter he's a college football writer for ESPN Jake welcome to Texas standard yeah good to be on what happened in Nineteen Ninety nine involves what's known and football is a place scripted I suppose we should\nFor folks who may not be totally familiar with that term explain what a play script actually is\nYes the office of coordinators and play callers and and football at all levels they will map out there for a few plays on a piece of paper and the table practice um you know the week leading up to the game\nAnd the reason is you know two or three fold you know you want to\nGet a rhythm offensively or you want to maybe probing defense to see\nOkay if we run this play how has the defense gonna light up a do\nOr that is what a play scripted every coordinator has one and Mike Lee certainly outlawed actually got to a going into the Nineteen Ninety nine game\nOkay let's talk a for a moment about Mike Leach here because he's the main culprit his reputation in college football I suppose is or as something of a rascal to put it mildly at the time he was Oklahoma's offensive coordinator and he's since been head coach of Texas back in Washington state\nSo what exactly did he concoct for this Nineteen Ninety nine Red River showdown\nSo he was joking with another assistant coach at Oklahoma a week of the game like hey you know it'd be funny you know actively mess with\nTexas before the game and\nIt was suggested that what if we came up with a ... place for him in late it on the field somewhere and and and and maybe Texas would pick it up well\nThey had a good laugh about it but\nWe decided hey why not do it\nRight out and see how it works so weaken the game is coming up with this fake place ... there's a lot of new ones in it because he wants to create a script should Texas use it\nThat's going to compliment the plays he's actually going to run so in other words if you're gonna run with let's just keep it simple if you're going to go to sleep to the left on the play script they would say sleep to the right so that it if it's going to the right\nTo play actually goes to laugh and again uh so uh that was on the other thing is he had to create like\nThe terminology for this script\nComplex enough that it would seem real\nBut simple enough so that Texas could could understand that he has it laminated it puts a Calcutta, India was an assistant at Oklahoma or his name at the top to make it look is official as possible and then it goes forward with ... are trying to figure out how to plant the script so that Texas will find\nIt so it has to look like you'd has accidentally what fallen out of coaches or Oklahoma coaches hands or how did he do that\nSo he called a couple of the players over before the game and it gives the script to this guy named ... there was a freshman tied it they said here's what I Want you to do I want you to wait a minute walk off a then then then go by the Texas in there and like you're jogging and act like you're trying to put this script in your\nIn your pads or your your belt and let it fall but don't act like you know or that it felt exactly do you think you you talk to them properly and then just run off sort of a student assistant for tax his name's Casey already thought\nHe picked it up and he takes it to the Texas locker in and give it to the defensive coordinator car racing I cannot believe that they found a a a gold mine like this and and can't believe that the break that they've caught\n[noise] so what happens is the game gets started\nOr you can imagine it didn't go very well for taxes they they're consulting the script and they think they know used place before they even get their their even run uh and uh oh you're goes on to score or another field or the other touched down there up Seventeen adopted it at that point that says you know what we've been ad we\nNeed to get back to what we were planning to do originally in Texas was the better team that you know they come back and actually when the game\nThirty eight twenty eight it was the biggest come back to Texas that it it had an addict completed and thirty four years so uh as likely to put it it would have been a lot more legendary at Oklahoma won the soccer you know I think a lot of people here\nThis tale for the first time may have the same reaction that's cheating isn't it or no\nI yeah I think if I was more under the gamesmanship of sports than it necessarily\n... I mean I think even the tactics guys thought it was funny you know like it is funny at the time [laughter] yeah they thought it was funny Nineteen years later and it and they they think it's especially think it's funny because they ended up winning the game and they not one of the game then oh my goodness they would have been\nAs my is lead to put it or even more legendary\nJay ... is a

rapper Pepsi edited for broadcast fans will note\nExemplify the fears regional pride you'll find in the Houston area rap scene it's the subject of a new book Houston wrapped tapes an oral history of by you city hip hop which is out this month from the University of Texas press\nIt's something of an encyclopedic look at the local scene told over dozens of interviews Texas AMC's with platinum selling records but also the lesser known rappers producers promoters and hustler\nComprise the life blood of Houston hip hop\nAnd Scott Walker is the man behind his new book in a native of Galveston, Texas last walking which actually standard thank you for having me this is an expanded edition of your book I suppose we should point out how long have you been working on this project to be making these contacts compiling these interviews that sort of thing\nSince two thousand five the photographer Peter Best started this project on his own uh as just a photo project in two thousand four then he brought me a boarding early two thousand five and or other books came out twenty Thirteen to twenty fourteen but basically I just never stopped and so that that ended up resulting\nIn the the new addition where we were able to stuff a lot more into what we're doing\nTo when you if you're starting out in two thousand two thousand five I'm tell us a little bit about how Houston's sort of put itself on the map I when it comes to hip hop music I mean how far back do you have to go to sort of see the roots here\nWell the the way we did it at least you know we at the point where we started it was right before there was a big Houston wave popular artists that you know got into the mainstream\nMight Jones slim thug Paul well so we really use that as sort of a starting point Anna reverse point because we we were right before that wave happen so that was great because it got us in with a lot of people we might not otherwise have been able to meet once everything started and got crazy [laughter]\nGrind them where you live with the pie\nTell you they can do dying you know we I was\nLiving in Florida and I do with ...\nWe just went backwards through the history from that point [noise] um so we kinda got to see everything happened\nIt was really a watershed moment but you know are interested in telling the history so it was nice to be able to have that sort of timeline to work with ...\nBut but what about the history itself why Houston why did it become a hotbed for this music\n[noise] well you know it's a huge city it's a it's a big southern city it's the largest city in the south and other people who come to Houston\nTo work from all over the region all over the world really so it's a very fertile rich cultural city as people in Houston themselves no um but I don't think it's really looked on that way or has it been at least classically a in the past ... as far as the\nThe ... the national hip hop scene and so you know it being such a massive city with lots of creative people in it they sort of fending for themselves and and you know made their own records and release them on their own labels and created their own scene you know I think anytime something is fertile like that that there's just lots and lots of artist making records\nIt always provides an in an interesting area in which to sort of micro focus so he used it obviously the first love comes from the fact that I Lived there for fourteen years I've run out of a sudden\nBut you know once you start really getting into it it's just such a massive massive cultural", "year": "2018",
