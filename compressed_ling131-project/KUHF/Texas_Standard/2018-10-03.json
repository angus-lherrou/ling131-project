{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "A multi pronged all all hands on deck approach to uh to begin a boosting paying wages again and ah we're we're it's exciting that actually worse there's more much more focused and conversation around it and you know step one is clearly a Fifteen dollar minimum wage it's a fascinating\nAnd precarious state of affairs that it is true that workers are demanding better wages and in a lot of cases getting them but you said unions should be stronger they are getting much much weaker you said that regulation\nShould start to favor workers and not corporate hedger moaning and in fact the Supreme Court appears to be going in the opposite direction it's a story that's going to get written over the coming decades of Michael Saltsman I I Want to turn to you and and be companies like Amazon or Walmart or even some of the states out there and you mentioned\nThe tight labor market it it seems like if you're going to raise wages that now is the timing companies are competing for workers it makes sense to pay better wages when labor market is so very tight\nUm is to pressure for better wages going to go away if unemployment goes up and evidently it will I don't know when\nI don't think I don't think it will I mean I think it's it's probably going to uh it it may lessen um but I think that the I think the fundamental question um that I think that underpins a lot of this is sort of what is\nThe best way to sort of boost pay at the at the bottom end of the pay scale in right now you have this sort of robust market dynamic and if it's some of that or decreases if if the economy takes a turn then we're going to be having a policy debate about okay well what what are other tools we have in our toolkit to raise wages\nAnd I I think that the concern I think that that we have is that\nUm that the minimum wage I think historically a has not only had some of these are unintended consequences in terms of reducing number of job opportunities um it also has not been tremendously well targeted um to to to families in poverty and so we've been really supportive of policies for instance like the earned income tax credit\nOr that the boost the wages through the tax code instead of through a mandate on employers\nAre and are intended to be much better targeted um to the employees who needed while not having an adverse effect on for instance a young adults I mean I I think young adults are often sort of the forgotten part you know a lot of these debates but\nYou know if you look it over the last Twenty years you've labor force participation has plummeted as a as as minimum wages have risen you've got this summer you had about eleven million teens who still weren't in the labor force\nI think what happens is we sort of look around and say well as a as companies decide well we're going to eliminate bus boys is we're going to eliminate people who are bagging groceries so we are going to limit cashiers um what happens to those young people who no longer have that first rung on the job later to move up\nWe're coming up on the end of the hour a Sarah Anderson your final thoughts because this debate is not over\n[laughter] I went to push back a little bit harder on your um suggestion that ideas about restraining CEO pay or just something for that that left end of the political world Stanford University did a poll that showed a fifty two percent of Republicans would put a cap\nOn CEO pay relative to work or pay that's that's beyond what I'm calling for it today though and that's a ordinary Republican so I think there is tremendous potential here to build a movement\nAcross the political spectrum to attack at the extreme inequality we're seeing today too narrow our economic gaps both by lifting out the bottom as Amazon take a step forward and doing today and bringing down the top and that would be good for everyone\nThat Sarah Anderson director of the global economy project at the Institute for

clapped\nNPR's Kelsey Snell says GOP leaders are seeking colon support\nRepublican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to deal\nThe president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of that\nNPR's Kelsey Snell in Indonesia time is running out for earthquake and tsunami victims still buried under rebel Indonesian disaster officials have increased the death toll to more than fourteen hundred people Michael Sullivan reports on the rescue efforts\nA spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said in Jakarta that rescue workers have reached all four of the worst affected areas but he declined to give an estimate on casualties three of the areas had been largely cut off since Friday by roads damaged by the earthquake landslides in down bridges\nOfficials say heavy equipment to clear the rubble are still in short supply\nAnd increasingly desperate survivors are still waiting for food and water and medical supplies\nMany still sleeping outside five days after the quake most of the dead reported so far were found in the

to Duke Energy they are in direct conflict with tests taken by the water keeper alliance\nBut they cannot nomination has the biggest splits in Democrats or Republicans that we've seen so far\nAnd the reason why obviously\nIs that this has become a very very partisan fight it's become partisan tightened since become partisan fight nationally and that has an ad natural eco with in the mid term elections there are a lot of Democrats who I see the Supreme Court now is a much bigger issue than they did in twenty sixteen\nThe Supreme Court according to a few Research Center is now the key issue for the twenty Eighteen elections people paying a lot of attention to what happens with this fight people are very strong opinions about what happens with this fight in that necessarily although it's hard to evaluate how much at this point necessarily trickles into mattress\nAll right well let's take a look at the state of the Senate as we speak Republicans holder or lead in a fifty a races or or for seats a democratic caucus holder leads in forty nine seats according to your reporting here\nSo I Would I'm not clear on is whether or not the Kavanaugh nomination and the battle over that changes in other words shifts a opinion or whether or not it just ... or ... opinion because as we've seen a lot of Trump's supporters are are backing Kevin Oh one hundred percent we see the same thing on the Democratic side\nThat's right and again it's hard I mean this is this is the sort of subtle ... influence on election is pretty hard to evaluate its hard any poll\nTo suss out the extent to which this is an important factor but I think what is important about outlaw nomination is that\nIt serves as a sport for people to get engaged in the election and this it looks like it's going to be very much a lesson about who turns out and to what extent they turn out I mean that's sounds like I'm being normal dumb political pundits that says it's really true\nThat watching cycle because midterms tend to favor Republicans difficult can send to vote more than Democrats\nThat the Democrats are so energized is the thing that's sort of throwing things into disarray and since pollsters are dependent on accurate estimates of who's going to turn out to vote\nIf you influence how many people come out the vote that throws off the polls that something we saw on twenty sixteen right so the the the challenge here is gauging the extent to which people are going to be so aggravated by the count on I'm not necessarily going to change your whole one park together it's going to spur them to come out to vote when they otherwise might not have\nYou been following this for some time so or going with what you see the numbers that you see a car and your own sense of the ground how do you think it's looking as we approach midterms\nWell the house is much less a question seems\nPretty likely the Democrats are going to retake the house it's not a certainty in the same way the Hillary Clinton we elect our life and I wasn't a certain extent but at the certainly the case of Democrats are very well positioned both because of how are voters use Democrats versus Republicans but also just a lot of sort of structural things like the number of Republicans that have given up their incumbency\nAnd not ... re election as soon as I was a much murkier question and the reason is not because on the Senate side people have a less partisan views it's simply that the map for the Democrats is so that they are far more seats\nIt's currently held by democratic incumbents that are up for re election this year than there are Republicans and that of course as a function of the fact that\nSix years ago in those terms started was two thousand call in here for the Democrats and it's a lot Democrats won in places where they might not otherwise have one so that's why this looks a lot trickier for the Democrats my guess is that the Senate ends up probably about split\nOf course when the most
