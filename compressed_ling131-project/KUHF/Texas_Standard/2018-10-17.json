of that\nAnd it's going to be fascinating to see what happens next month during the elections\nIt's been great hearing some of your stories about understanding your own heritage sure you're very tribal heritage is Brad from Marilyn sent us this note using our app won a vox pop I'm\nOne of the Native American morning to the southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky\nI only notice because my grandmother's for sure quarter Native American and she did some work to get some records and get us registered with the tribe and I even got it sent a travel rule card in the mail [noise]\nI've heard that I can take advantage of this get benefits like free health care or even to green bean need American sort of white to get around\nAffirmative action type things but I feel that I don't really deserve it from time really just white and taking advantage of this would be unfair to actual Native Americans to have to deal with real Native American issues [laughter] so I don't really make a part of my enemy to mention it to people\nOr I'm Sorry grandma but the real card is just a novelty\nWe appreciate you sharing your story with us thanks very much mark I wonder what you make of that particularly this idea of taking advantage there was a story regarding um house majority leader Kevin McCarthy and identity in some programs that are related to Native Americans what what's your thought on that\nWell in that one was an interesting one because of the tribe that they enrolled and really doesn't exist it wasn't a federally recognized tribe\nI'm certainly there are those that will try to gain the system with things like that\nBut for the vast majority of folks even things like health care\nOr the Indian Health system is very complex and it's not free health care some of it is prepaid healthcare but it it it's not I'm kind of the Penn is the approach that you think of I spend a lot of time working on that right now one of the interesting things is much more of the Indian Health system is funded by Medicaid dollars from the Indian\nHealth service but medicate yeah exactly\nSo you have to qualify goes through the process and show income levels and all of that\nAt least wrote on our Facebook page thank you for this informative show today encouraging to hear there are more Native Americans running especially women\nJoan tweeted you're going to need a bigger show there's way more than an hour's worth of native issues that need to be discussed eight men to that job and we will not leave the sushi behind before we go though more can you just clarify for us exactly what happened with Kevin McCarthy in the end this program ah that's set aside for Native Americans we if we can you explain that before we go\nSure this uh says PA has set aside program for a ... for native owned businesses and you have to be identified as a tribal a citizen for that or and his wife's family and a brother in law I as I understand it were um basically running a company that was taking advantage of those set asides\nReally has has there been an investigation to that or any kind of a\nTrial yet now that it's in the news I think there will be an investigation into that\nI Would imagine so and for one more thing before I let you go to our listeners who said that he didn't feel she deserved to take advantage of those benefits that he identified as primarily just whites would you say to him\nWell again that puts it in a racial context instead of a tribal citizen contact and uh if you're a member of a community it's a self governing community that you want to be part of and have this long arc of history and be supportive of people I mean\nOne of the reasons why there's someone people getting excited by the number of Native Americans running for office right is

close quote [noise]\nNow I don't want to take this too far but there's been this I'm a ... ... the Saudis have not since at least the days of the old Arab oil embargo of the seventies tried to use oil is a kind of geo political weapon if you will do you think that they're talking about going back to\nTo to to using to weaponize ing oil if you will\nIs it certainly sounds like they are and so that's a tough talk from important changes of leadership I said they're different people charged with Saudi Arabia now than a few decades ago\nSaudi Arabia is really position to sell for decades as a college or global player what can you keep markets staple not looking to disrupt things the total we're hearing in the last few days a week sounds different than that where sounds a little more emboldened I Would say\nUm that used to happen with electrons from Iran by the way when oil prices are higher I often joked in the classes I taught that you could track belligerence\nWork count from speeches from Iranian leaders based on oil prices higher moral price the more confident Iranian leadership was and therefore the Merkel and her they were and I'm Wondering if we're seeing something to learn how to write their prices are higher gives more confidence or use oil as a weapon therefore tougher talk\nSo it might just be bless her might just be tough talk which we don't know if it's actually a change in policy\nIt was something that Saudi Arabia did or in the seventies certainly and in the eighties or the other way around ramping up production the cause of global oil price collapse which bankrupted a lot of their competitors many of them in Texas so all I can can be caused by spike or collapse but it hasn't been done in decades maybe where I've seen a change in tune\nDoctor wherever

well\nGoldberg and others on the show laughed it off the matter is serious for some in Houston Florian Martin of Houston Public media explains\nMayor Sylvester Turner moved swiftly and presented an ordinance to city council that expands the meaning of adult arcades to include anthropomorphic devices in other words human like sex dolls or robots\nIt passed unanimously and some of the public comments before the vote at city hall or telling about how the community feels at least open like this this tax Christopher any\nPatients five thirty why it says that a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joining us to his wife and they become more it doesn't say that a man should leave his mother and father and go and join a robot\nLeading the charge against kinky stalls the company that wants to open the sex do business in Houston is a Christian group allied your rising\nIt's dedicated to fighting prostitution and human trafficking they started an online petition

[laughter]\nAnd we educate them and a lot of times they just kind of run out the door\nBut here's the thing there's one argument that says robot prostitutes might actually lower the demand for human sex workers can't boss response\nAt the end of the day I don't think they're going to always choose that over a woman I think it's going to be an entry point for men who might be interested in purchasing sex\nHis theory has also helped by some researchers most prominently a British professor that founded the organization campaigning against sex robots but in the case of the Houston robot Brussels is it really about sex trafficking\nThat seems to me to be not really the reason people are against it\nTemplar summers as a philosophy professor at the University of Houston you often talks about human sexuality and morality in his twice monthly podcast summers says there just aren't any empirical studies to prove a connection\nSo I think what people are really concerned with is what does it say about our city what does it say about our city that we would be the first city to open a sex robot Ross\nHe points to comments like this by city council member Brenda started\nWe don't want to be known worldwide for these things we don't want these things happening here\nWith the updated ordinance a company cannot let customers have sex with dolls or robots on site it can still have a show room and sell their products but that's about it at least legally kinky stalls the sex Roebuck company did not respond to multiple requests for comment\nBut it's the oh you've all Gabrielle told the British tabloid daily mirror they're looking at legal options\nYesterday people stood next to the bridge on highway to anyone that leads into marble falls watching the water rushed by many of them during variations on this the this is just\nCrazy absolutely crazy\nJonathan Hammons lived here Thirty years and says he's never seen flooding like this same went forward ...\nWe saw how split down the river earlier [noise]\nSo I'm not sure where it was from\nYes they're losing their houses\nAre all fall has seen serious floods before one in Nineteen Ninety seven and one in two thousand seven\nWhat makes this one different is that it wasn't storms right overhead but the water coursing down stream that caused much of the damage with city officials marble fall sought heading this way they told people living close to the banks to evacuate Loretta Higgins that her son Travis Willis were among them they said they didn't have much time\nI was in my little trailer the next thing I Know the water rushed up to it it was that the windows in my car and my trailer and just wet\nMy grandma told me to run to her and it was about me hide to my legs before I got to her yeah it was pretty bad\nThey think it could be days it maybe a week before they're allowed back to check but worry and their homes are gone\nBut at the first Baptist church in town where they another evacuated ended up

his brother with\nSo sharing czar regardless of condition I probably will sell it and move\nWhere he says he'd like to find a house that doesn't flood\nMostly shell is here in the studio with us or good to see a most and thanks for the update their uh I I Want to ask you about something because in marble falls which is where you were there were a lot of people who are saying that they were rather surprised by the rapid rise because it didn't seem like the rain was coming down a particularly heavily\nThat's right and that's the thing to remember about this flood it it wasn't a flood of where you know mobile falls in two thousand seven they had this event they called the reign bombed like massive amounts of rain Warren right on this community flooding creeks um there were fatalities on the roads this flood was different it was a lot of rain up river and the Leno river\nBasin that feeds that river Russia that water comes down to the river and then enters the Colorado River which in marble falls a lot of people that are considered to be a lake lake ... um it's actually the Colorado River and so that kind of a wall of water is just rushing down the river and you had this river flooding and then it's what we're seeing is that water coming down\nHitting these communities and then also hitting these reservoirs that are controlled by the L. C. R. A. they're kind of like buckets\nAlong the Colorado River\nWhere they'll see alright the lower Colorado River authority is where we are joined\nUs write things that have yet to this is the uh the this kind of state agency that controls these reservoirs along the river and and what they're doing now what we're seeing is it there are allowing the water to pass through these various reservoirs which again a lot of people here think of as lakes right hum\nAnd uh allow that wanted to pass in a way that it's a can can kind of get through the river but perhaps not cause a ... and much flooding along the\nWay so what we're really talking about are the mechanics of managing\nThis flow of water that's I mean that's that's what we're experiencing in large part of he'll country right now\nThat's exactly right David and and they have a kind of a limited capacity to do that because many of these reservoirs weren't created\nFor fun control they were created for maybe agricultural use but lake Travis does have what they call a flood pool which is kind of an extra amount of space to contain access water of course like Travis now is a long pass capacity\nIt is how much of a surprise is this and is this something that we can expect to see more of in the future\nI'm Glad you asked that question because it's it's kind of a big coincidence but just in the last\nAnd the NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nYou David um they just released a new uh for a kind of a flood\nMap of Texas said it's a it's updated rainfall data and what that says is that we can expect heavier rain events more often in the state and particularly even looking at these river basins this new data shows that these types of floods can be expected more often than we used to think\nMost polls show

years\nWhile seals installation as a permanent one other pieces will be established shorter term scale seal sees the houses more than just a vehicle for his art\nI'm interested in the idea that the
