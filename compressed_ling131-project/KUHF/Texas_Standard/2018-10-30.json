we think from the energy capital of the world Travis ... reports on energy and the environment from our partner station Houston Public media Travis welcome back to the standard hey good beer so flaring generally speaking is up anyway as you've reported why is that\nBasically there are not enough ah pipelines in the ground in West Texas enough space on those pipelines to move all the gas that is coming up a\nWind drillers are out there pulling oil out of the ground or get a lot of what's called associated gas this is natural gas that just comes up with it and it's basically a by product it's not really worth anything they're certainly not drilling for the gas drilling for oil that's what they care about and so all this gas comes up they don't have enough infrastructure out there to move it all\nA cause the area's just booming so much and so they wind up a burning it off into the air which is\nOf course environmentally speaking not great it's a waste of you know a products to but it is a better approach than just releasing it into the air which is known as venting a that's a lot more dangerous to the atmosphere\nInteresting okay so I was a I I saw an article that s in the global market intelligence had published in raised as an intriguing question are some shale producers under reporting gas flaring which the theory here\nSo this is Ehsan ... analysis of some ... satellite data that they looked at so to be clear this is not my own analysis of this data other basically they looked at you know real time satellite data of flaring that no it does\nAnd they found that from twenty ... twenty Seventeen oil companies might in Texas might have flared off twice as much gases they wound up\nReporting to the states which then gave some reports to the feds the federal energy information administration\nBasically what's going on here that essence he asserts that\nThere was this multi layered reporting system where oil and gas companies report to state regulators who then report to the federal energy information administration got it and they say in that chain of reporting you know\nSome of these numbers might be getting lost or skewed too low and they note that this could be happening intentionally or not but that it looks like it's happening\nOkay so let's assume the worst let's assume that there is intentional under reporting just for the sake of argument so we can understand what's at stake here why would oil companies have an interest in under reporting the number of uh uh sites where there were flares well\nThere are limits on swearing in Texas I mean the Texas railroad commission regulates the stuff you have to get a permit to flare the railroad commission particularly in the boom times doing a lot of extending those permits and and allowing producers to flare\nWhich they've been criticized before but they've said that's just what's going on now and it's necessary to keep the oil flowing\nAnd you know there's just this possibility that companies are trying to make sure that they don't have to shut down their wells I mean you know if wearing got to hide the railroad commission might eventually fail care patients is run out you've got to shut down these wells\nAnd their possible yeah some of that that's going on currently but you know across the landscape this seeming under reporting\nIf it's intentional would be you know designed to keep the oil flowing basically because that's the valuable commodity it's not this excess and gas\nOr doesn't that have a legal if not criminal implications\n[noise] I mean yeah there are finds you know for violating permits and violating state regulations on this kind of stuff I mean I I sit the U.S and the analysis to the Texas railroad commission spokesperson got back and said\nUh you know didn't really answer whether or not they're looking into this further but said you know our highest priority is protection of public safety in the environment in that you know Texas oil and gas companies have to be in compliance with the rules but again no sign whether the ... mission is going to look at this analysis in depth anymore in particular\nIs it safe to using to to assume that there's more flaring than report\nIt I don't know if it's safe to assume that I mean I I think that part of this as an pie analysis of saying that you know this this multi layered reporting thing could be losing some of the numbers so that seems plausible\nI don't know if it's as high I mean this is they're proprietary analysis that they've done a it's certainly something that environmental groups are concerned about I mean I can tell you just anecdotally that\nThere are things that happened in the oil field that um are accidents you know there are ... that are there whereas when you go out there that are supposed to be burning off this gas\nBut uh just kind of like your oven at home the pilot light went out sometimes the waiters go out and you know it can be awhile before somebody gets down the road and gets out there to relate it so I mean you know accidents happened and and things are um things happen in the oil people that you don't always expect but I don't know if it's
