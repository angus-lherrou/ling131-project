nuts\nI'm Bill pine is a long time supporter of ... as he was actually on his way to a new ad campaign event known as with appearing with Jason Jason ... former congressman from Utah now Fox News personality to try and raise some campaign signs\nOn and it was struck by what Bill said to me because he said at one point I'd gone to the point where I don't believe anyone anymore and that was really reflected what I saw across that district um you know there's deep distrust\nFrankly in the national media\nUm it was it was challenging to kinda do that icebreaker to to talk to people because they were like where are you from and they've been approached by ... you know multiple naturally and um you know it was a case where you got to go there and you know I show up at his high school and ended up talking to his ag teacher for\nAbout twenty minutes and he told me that multiple outlets have tried to contact him and he always says no for the most part\nUm so you see a real wariness and

talks just briefly will eat any major takeaways I mean ... it was kind of been angling for this job for a long long\nLong time as you know well from having spent some time here yourself the key issue here I think is really going to be housing or they spent a lot of time talking about that in this debate everyone agrees that the situation is bad you know people are leaving California and where are they going there ... going to places like Texas and Arizona\nA Oregon places where the cost of living is lower on the housing affordability issue has had a lot of people here are very hard\nCox John

helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com and from listeners\nThat's the importance of keeping track of these things of understanding why it is that people die so that hopefully you can intervene and and prevent those deaths and future disasters\nBut I suppose there's also it has to be admitted a political dimension here too as we've seen in the aftermath of Puerto Rico\nWill absolutely uh it it had this number of the death count has become extremely political because the long held death toll was sixty four\nAnd then public health research you know looking at statistics showed that close to three thousand more people died than would have been expected otherwise so there was a real you know a big big big Gulf between official numbers and what we think actually happened\nSo let me understand why it is that there isn't a consensus on how you count debts in the wake of storm a surely there would be federal guidelines I mean the Centers for Disease Control\nCorrect there are some federal guidelines they were put out last year after Hurricane Maria based on on you know a convening lots of experts to look at this issue but this is a long held problem it goes back many years and researchers had been writing about it for many years\nSo this new guide that the CDC put out\nIs an attempt to get right to the very person who fills out the death certificate and help them understand for purposes of keeping track of these things let's have everybody do this and a standard way\nAnd here's the big issue I think we can all understand what a direct storm death is right is what we're seeing today with people who were killed when the wind blew two and a tree fell on them or you know very tragically all the people who are going out and driving into floodwaters and drowning outweigh\nThe tricky part is what they're calling so called a indirect deaths so this could be somebody who they rely on oxygen and they couldn't get their oxygen or a you know they were having a heart attack but an ambulance couldn't get to them and so\nWhat the CDC has recommended is that those be counted as storm deaths too but currently those are typically missed\nSo um you ... you spoke with a Harris County medical examiner's office in Houston and of course they received a lot of attention certainly in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey did they explain what their policy rationale was toward toward the use of the CDC guidelines\nThey did I went back to the Harris County\nExaminer's office and said now that the CDC guy does out are you going to change how you look at these indirect deaths they said no we need to keep doing things the way we've been doing them if you listen this definition where's the line\nAnd so we'll just make sure that all that information on you know from our investigations are are in somebody's records and um unfortunately though if if it's not recorded on somebody's\nDeath certificate if the storm itself or the natural disaster or human disaster in the case of terrorist attack and that's not mentioned on a death certificate it becomes harder for officials\nTrying to go through statistics to really detect the relationship and so at all does have to start with the individual coroner medical examiner or doctor and I found that just everybody I spoke to for this article had a different way of thinking about it\nTallying the dead why a storm death and once they might not count in another it's a very
