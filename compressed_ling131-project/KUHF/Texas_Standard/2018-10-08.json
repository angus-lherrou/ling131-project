registered to vote there are as many of these organizations as like seats in the ... so that's one thing and Carlos mentioned this to that is really helpful and getting\nMore registered voters out there in fact the number registered voters has been going up since about the Nineteen nineties and so\nYou can find now these are available there's these notes to vote anywhere you can get libraries and\nTaco stands and every other restaurant you know up and down the uh you know Congress Avenue in Austin so there are good things about this but the problem is getting people to then go register to vote and problems like this pop up their problems and also in Harris County that popped up with respect to\nSome of the people who were otherwise eligible had been kicked off the rolls for a kind of a fluke and so this is something which the state needs to address and if they can't then there's always going to be out of a lag in terms of\nWell you know something we should point out too is that the secretary of state's office maintains its position that uh these are not valid a there are some counties some officials in some counties who say their position is they're going to go ahead and accept these ah registration attempts until someone with authority tells him not to\nSo this could wind up being another post election day mess but of course we'll we'll have to wait and see I think something that we've been sort of hinting at but I think we should address directly\nIs the fact that registration obviously is one thing showing up to the polls is another does any of this activity signaled anything about the midterms per se\nVoting in the United states of tougher than it is the most nations and most of the boxes on the world you're automatically registered to vote so we've got to take a different step and so people are so in this kind of enthusiasm registered to vote pretty nice of you know it has to be at least thirty is for the election to me that is an indication that there is a higher level of interest and selection\nAnd of course we have to devote to vote so you know I'm not expect of this you know shattered sixty percent voted for anything like that but I Would expect that you know my expectation is going to be higher than it's been said in the was the last Mets and we had um a twenty um fourteen fourteen minutes from now it'll be hard on that one I Would expect ...\nI think so and like like Carlos says you know we've seen this lag and it's been pretty consistent I'd part of the reason is because the state has been dominated by one party or the other for the better part of the last hundred plus years so now it's Republican dominated and Democrats feel like their voice doesn't matter\nWe also live at the fact that Latino turnout is lower than it is in other states um the number of eligible Latinos to vote\nIs about forty four percent and that's in contrast to about eighty percent for the Anglo populations the states also young I got that Carlos pointed to some really good six figures which suggest that you know a young state is not likely to turn out\nVoters who have more money mortgages and marriages are more likely to turn out and younger voters don't always have that so it's difficult to get people to go from the step of being registered to being mobilized by a group by a party or by candidate\nBrand and riding houses political

and a child together\nWhen the court order came down in late June about twenty six hundred children were in government custody most with or are the office of refugee resettlement but there were also kids like chorus daughter who'd already been released to sponsors\nThe government is taking the position that children who were released from or custody before the injunction was assured are not part of the case in the title to reunify with their families\nLegal learned as an attorney with the ACLU which sued the government over family separation it's not clear how many children fall into this category the government hasn't released those numbers and the department of health and Human Services declined an interview request\nWhatever that number go learnt says these children have the right to be reunified with their parents\nWe don't think there should be an artificial deadline when a child is titled weird ... ... has another concern\nWe believe some families find a way of their children to live with sponsors not understanding that they didn't have to do that and that they had a way to reunify with their child\nCynthia canal is is an immigration attorney in El Paso and she says she's representing one mother who did exactly that\nHer daughter was desperate to get out of a government shelter and she had no idea there was a court case in the works so she signed her child over to our relatives this was before canal is got involved with the case\nAt the time she made what she thought was the best decision the reality is touching known that they were gonna start reuniting she probably would have chosen to be reunited\nLegal aren't with the ACLU wants to make something clear even if the government reverse its course and decides these parents are eligible for reunification\nThat doesn't necessarily mean they'll get released from detention the government could release them or it could give them a choice to reunify with their children and family detention or have their children stay with sponsors still Gelernt says it's important for parents to have that choice\nIn many cases the child is not know the sponsor for a little connection to respond to and so if a parent wants to child back they need to be given the drawback\nGelernt says the ACLU may bring some of these issues to court but for now parents like Clara just have to wait in detention\nClara says she doesn't speak to her daughter very often\n\nI can only ask how she's doing because she started to cry and eating it leave and can talk anymore says at that plant clients sister in law usually

of cult of the machine precision isn't at American art sue welcome to Texas ...\nThank you tell us a little bit about why you chose a cult of the machine I mean is that does sound fairly dark here\nWell it's a two edged sword and a sense well the Cold War machine a there was really this obsession between the two world wars about the the machine and basically in a sense that it was\nSeen as an enhancement of life on one hand some people even thought it might ... of course we'll be bringing peace and prosperity et cetera\nAnd then on the other hand you had individuals who were concerned about it that they saw in the sense of you know almost like a robots taking our life they afraid that you know as workers particularly ... assembly line\nThat they would become slaves to the machine you see a lot of\nThat fear I suppose in something like and this is what it reminds me of Fritz Lang metropolis right\nYes yes definitely and that sort of a dystopian sort of saying that some machines were seen almost as a Frankenstein character that's going to prey upon them why do you think that\nThere was this guy should I mean we're talking about this period you mentioned between the two wars so we're really talking about the Nineteen twenties and the Nineteen thirties right\nMhm yeah on one side you know people were looking for basically reassurance after World War one and also I Would say the flu pandemic they're looking for reassurance no that would basically restore order to their lives and generally as period is called return to order\nThis is also the time in which we're seeing huge monuments to the accomplishment of the human species I suppose you could say with the ... of skyscrapers like for instance the Empire State building\nIt it was really a building explosion in New York several things were going on that led to the rise of the skyscraper basically the skyscraper really became emblematic of America itself and particularly of New York but for it to happen\nI basically it required some technological advances for it to even occur the key one for that was going to be the invention of steel frame\nArchitecture you know the interior Skelton steal\nIt would carry a lot more weight and then it meant that the exterior walls were only a shooting a skin up to that time the load bearing was done by thick brick wall meant you could go much higher and the other
