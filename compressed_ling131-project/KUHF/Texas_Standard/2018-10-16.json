picked up ... she'll take back to Aubrey middle school\nChristian Hernandez is a Texan and the twenty Seventeen American University fellow at the center for Public Integrity in Washington DC and he's been writing about this\nIn recent article in Mother Jones Christian welcome back to the Texas standards Hi thanks for having to tell us a little bit about this Texas wind rush or what's behind that and and what about these expiring federal subsidies\n[noise] so the main\nDriver of of the growth of the wind industry and the U.S has been the production tax credit which was established under the\nBush administration um it's been in place since Nineteen Ninety four but [noise] about Seventy percent of the thirty seven billion dollars in subsidies that have been that the industry has received come from this one credit which expires at the end of next year\nAnd a what I've been looking into is the role that the states will play\nAnd the future of of this industry\nWell before we get to what role Texas might have here I'm just hung up on this number what was it how how much in subsidies again\nThirty seven billion dollars and thirty\nSeven billion dollars I can see how that could go a long way toward helping to establish an industry here in Texas but isn't the idea of subsidies that you set something up and then it starts to pay for itself I mean these weren't going to be a infinite ... there was going to be some kind of limit right\nJust in the last decade the\nProduction tax credit the subsidy has expired four times but\nThrough lobbying effort and\nThe past that ministry nations focus on green energy and renewable energy it's it's been extended several times so under the current political climate\nIndustry leaders do not expect this to be extended again so that is what has set off this rush to build a new wind farms across the U.S\nTwo thousand two hundred of these three hundred five hundred foot wind turbines were built ... just in two thousand Seventeen in Texas\nBut right now there's been a lot from other states pushed to re knew these mandates I'm so that they could continue to subsidize and incentivize the production and investment of wind energy\nIs it ... if you have these mandates I mean that's sort of sounds like the stick in the carrot and stick equation whereas this Texas offers subsidies or are they not just saying your energy mix in total has to include a certain amount of renewables\n... in Texas the mandates were met in two thousand and ten and I'm right now Texas is producing about Thirteen percent of its energy from renewables but compared to the federal\nSubsidies it is it is very small in comparison it's twenty four dollars per megawatt hour where the federal subsidy compared to about fifty five cents that comes from the state so the main factor in the growth of wind energy in Texas is the free market\nBut also the is seven billion dollar investment that was made in the early to thousands to connect all of these wind farms\nThat were built in in West Texas out in the middle of nowhere on top of these may says so there had to be a way to connect them to the grid\nAnd I'm taxes\nOut taxpayers they paid seven billion dollars to next to them um with this recent when rush\nOr the capacity of these transmission lines that were built um first starting in two thousand and seven um is is almost that capacity so there might need to be further investment from Texas is about um this when rush continues\nWell not a question then I mean what does all this add up to for the future of the Texas wind industry if indeed the subsidies federal subsidies are allowed to expire\nSo these federal subsidies last for ten years so as long as they get in before the deadline which is December twenty Nineteen [noise] they will have a this credit for the next ten years so the wind farms that are being built right now and that have\nBeen built in the last uh it'll fifteenth\nYears will continue to produce this energy\nBut something interesting has also happened because of the subsidies and investment a new technology has been created where these wind turbines compared to the ones that were built Fifteen Twenty years on work twice as tall and are able to produce three times as much energy so there definitely is a future for the industry\nNow whether there'll be able to survive without the subsidy that's that's the question\nChristian Hernandez knows about this subject as a Texan Andy twenty Seventeen American University fellow at the center for Public Integrity in D.C He's been writing
