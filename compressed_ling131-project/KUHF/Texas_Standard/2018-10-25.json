help getting out of her wheelchair and into her Walker she and husband not have the routine down pat\nHard and has a rare neurological disorder that in flames her brain and causes seizures doctor said was related to injection she got when joining the navy\nLast year she had her third brain surgery to relieve the symptoms while it's helped manage the seizures it limited hardens mobility\nLockers he's proud of my rehab that helps me start to be able to get\nMore mobilization on my on\nGetting a Walker wasn't easy hardens doctor ordered it from the VA in April but they had trouble getting one of the parts and couldn't fill the order right away\nI'm just kind of used to it I guess I just find\nTo just now that I'm going to have\nTo wait months later the VA still hasn't come through harden ended up getting a same Walker from project meant San Antonio based nonprofit group that refurbish his medical equipment and gives it to people at a cost savings the order took them just a few days\nRight now the VA says it has about eighty five hundred equipment requests that have waited longer than thirty days Fred downs prosthetics consulting with paralyzed veterans of America Says that's cause for concern\nUm I'm not comfortable with that number I Need no more facts were composed of what type of orders\nDowns used to work for the VA and helped to build their prosthetics service back in the eighties he says there are legitimate reasons why some cases drag on but down says complex cases are one thing a bureaucratic obstacles or another and he isn't sure which category that VA delays fall into as it turns out VA isn't either they're still analyzing the data\nThe thing that we all worried about or those cases where a veteran you need the wheelchair this prescribe\nAnd so the veteran goes home doesn't hearing things from the VA\nThis is where you and others here problems who or what happened to it he's still sitting omit or two three four months and is not there what the heck\nSomebody has dropped the ball big time\nVA received more than six hundred and fifty thousand requests for prosthetic items and medical devices every month and delays have long been a problem the secretary Robert Wilkie says this year's numbers actually represent a market improvement\nAcross the country last year sixty four thousand prosthetic requests for thirty days old or older we've now got that down to eighty five hundred\nLast year the VA inspector general found a host of problems with the way some medical centers were handling prosthetics\nSince then the department is change some of its processes they've made it easier to track equipment request to enter holding medical center directors more accountable for fulfilling them the agency is now trying to determine how many delayed requests are acceptable Wilkie says he's proud of the ... progress so far\nThat is certainly a case where we have moved out and it shows America that the department does have the potential for agility and adaptability\nThat spans San Antonio's entire existence it's called San Antonio try centennial history Miller is a former professor at trinity University He now teaches at Pomona College professor Miller thanks so much for taking a few minutes out to talk with us on the Texas standard\nThank you you've been studying San Antonio's history for a long time for a while you were working on this book was there anything that you came across it sort of\nSurprised if there were a lot of things David that surprised me and the fact that I was surprised also worried me like I moved to San Antonio for twenty six years how come I didn't know X Y and Z but actually also loved that part of what the book does is try to expose\nOther elements outside of the Alamo he's now that really shaped it's life\nWas you know it's funny that you should mention that because I Do think that you're you're on to something it's almost as if people think of San Antonio's history is beginning right around Eighteen thirty six or so\nWell that is how most history books tend to go rights and uh so part of the reason for writing three hundred years was obviously the the gimmick of the celebration of the tri centennial\nBut that really allowed me to dig back deep into actually the sixteen hundreds or to think about what it meant before San Antonio was a city that the Spanish developed\nTo give credence to and pay ... to ah the ... and other native bands that lived in that space and why they lived in the space the way they did and that really set up the book because it helped me understand one of the surprising things that I knew but didn't\nWas how much this city was born of violence the violence not only of the ... of patching the command cheese roaring down the plane to attack the Spanish but cloud in the middle of that conflict were the date of people that had made the space their own but only to find that that space was now in conflict and\nFrom that point on and tell really post civil war or San Antonio with a pretty violent place as various groups fought literally fought a to gain control over it and blood at times flowed in the streets floating the reverse it quite appalling in retrospect\nWhy is it uh do you think that this particular place became that cross roads for conflict was it was it a particularly desirable piece of land what what what was it about this area\nWell some of it has to do with the environment and that's another one of the themes in the book is to look at the space literally the terrain wash the rivers flow through at sea its relationship to the hill country to the southern plains um and to remember that natural systems really guide the way in which human beings\nOwn a place and how they live in a place and so I think some of it had to do with those environmental factors some of it had to do with\nThe way in which the Spanish nestled themselves into that river valley and ultimately built a series of missions their very presence of which\nLed various people to think well if those infrastructure is there and then we get the fight over that infrastructure and I think that's part of what the Alamo was the Alamo it's the fact of that thing being there that gives it a almost a destination battleground let's go fight over that place\nBecause it's there\nAnd and it's this true before the Alamo in thirty six as it would be afterwards um and so it's a really interesting dynamic where nature obviously rules a lot of these choices and challenges but then human beings build on top of it and you start to see these layers unfold you\nKnow I feel a special bond to the city I Can't quite figure out why but it's it's one of those issues I always wanted a scratch when I when I get a chance to come to San Antonio I Want to go see something I haven't really had a chance to see before experience something I haven't\nUh I Wonder since you know completed this three hundred year overview of San Antonio any suggestions\nWe leave town well one of the things that I remember sort of in in its in Kuwait stage where it's all of this conversation about the river and its extension south along the missions and north up to the museum and I've walked apart from the museum's downtown\nWhat I haven't done is the south reach 'em and that's a more um from what I can tell from friends who do it regularly it's much more\nLess tourists D. and much more local\nUm and I think that would be the place I Would go\nJust to walk it in part because walking is such a great way of things that you can't see by car right and I think that's where you begin to see the way in which the city of started to return to the river and that's one of the themes in the book also which was for many years it was a flood control channel\nIt's now becoming much more of a communal space and that communal mess of it it's really exciting\nChar Miller is a former professor at trinity University He now teaches at Pomona College and he's the
