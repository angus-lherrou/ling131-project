judges I have not found anywhere that I can find the decisions\nOn the judges that are running this year\nOh okay so there shouldn't be too hard I'm a reporter and I have to go there are more than three thousand elected judges in Texas Texas is one of just six states that pick members of their Supreme Court this way\nHuh one of just six pack appellate court justices this way and one of nine states that lets voters picked district court judges why we do this\nWell it goes back in history this system was set up\nBefore the civil war and then reintroduced after the civil war and have not been modified seriously says Eighteen Ninety One so to an extent we're still on harsh and buggy\nSaint Mary school of law professor Wayne Scott says this system was fine in horse and buggy days when most people lived in small towns and everyone knew everyone\nThen when you voted for a judge who you're voting for what you're getting [noise] has become an urbanized society that's changed has more difficult now to know who you're voting for running for what shop\nI Wonder have judges feel about this whole set up I guess I'll have to ask one hell about judge Sandy Marian\nI currently serve as the chief justice of the fourth quarter of appeals in San Antonio Texas\nShe's been a judge for twenty six years and she's had to run for this office several times\nFor myself it was very difficult to campaign for office because you'd have to raise money\nAsk people for money\nYou have to really help yourself\nAnd I remember feeling very uncomfortable doing those things\nAnd you have to pick a party\nBut once you get elected\nYou really have to take that political hat off\nAnd it's it's not always easy for everyone today\nWhen judge Marianne run she knows it's difficult for voters to learn about her\nSo you have to get the word out through\nI always feel like male outs are good inappropriate but again that's just your side of the story right\nSo she says you can't only rely on the candidates promotional material or yard signs\nIf you're voting simply because he saw that\nOr you saw that one candidate had more signs and the other that is absolutely no indication of the qualifications and that individual for the moment\nNow for years our question our pets he had been getting in talent candidates for judge to a great thing I Would ask people who I knew in the legal profession day we read a man and what a weren't experts agree is a great way to learn about candidates for judge\nCalling a lawyer or you're a lawyer and asking them to tell you about a judge\nLawyers know who is a good job or who is a good candidate from Chad [noise]\nSo there's really no easy short cut here you have to do the work to learn about the judge's he'll be voting for and judge Marion helps you will\nIt's such an important role that the judiciary played in our system and I just hope that voters will take the time to learn about him educating yourself as the most important thing that you can do to ensure that we have a strong position [noise]\nFor the Texas standards ... in San Antonio\nAnd if you do want to get started researching the judges that will be on your ballot you

that's a T shirt a hat\nOr button to go vote so you definitely don't want to wear your pet crews that are about ... or any type of political T shirts to go vote\nVictor ... is one of those scientists she's a professor at northern Illinois university who specializes in extreme weather\nAnd climate change professor John ... thanks so much for spending a few minutes with us on the Texas standard no problem thanks for having me so I understand you were a one of the brains behind this study published in the latest Journal of climate and atmosphere at science\nSuggesting a shift in were tornadoes are happening in the U.S\n[noise] yeah that's exactly right and to be honest we were all surprised when we started digging through these tornado records\nOr as you mentioned at the start there are many states people think of as tornado alley right Texas Oklahoma and Kansas among those and they still are the epicenter of tornado activity the frequencies of tornadoes wrestle highest in those states what we've noticed over the last forty years there's been a downward trend\nIn Texas Oklahoma and Kansas in in terms of the number of tornadoes that have occurred in a in a very sharp increasing trend in places like Alabama Mississippi tendency in portions of the Midwest\nNow it's not uncommon if you live in Alabama or Georgia or any place a little further east of Texas to to have a season of tornadoes especially in the spring and early summer I grew up in Georgia and we used to have our share of those when we talk about an increase in that area how big of an increase [noise]\nYou're really only talking maybe three to four tornadoes per decade so it's not like a\nBig increase in any one of these small little boxes that we examined in our study but even three to four tornadoes you know in a say a hundred kilometer by hundred kilometer box is still a pretty significant sharp increase when you look at the grand scheme of things\nSo it equates really to about twenty to twenty five percent increase in any given region\nState wow that that that does sound a significant so how is your team been tracking this\nWell this kind of two ways so the first way is to track where tornadoes occur and that's fairly straightforward and I said fairly straightforward because if you go back through the historical record one tornadoes cause damage right new studies occur and when you have a newspaper reports and so on and you can go back and get a pretty good idea of the activity [noise]\nBut what we've seen really over the last Twenty years or so that more tornadoes are being recorded right more people have cell phones there's a lot more storm chase him better technology like riding radar and so very rare for any of these trade has to go on reported nowadays\nSo we used reports right with that kind of ... that we knew that there is some increasing trend but then we also examine what are called tornado environment or this this parameter in the paper we called significant tornado parameter\nAnd you can sort of think of that has a tornado watch so when the conditions are favorable portrays we capture that outside of the model we bring that in and analyze how those environment changing as well\nMhm now you have a working model or a theory as to why this shift may be happening\n[noise] well that's a great question and we kind of leave that in the paper is sort of open science something that needs to be examined further\nWe kind of ... to potential things so number one would be natural variability in other words this is just kind of a quiet forty thirty four year period that we're moving into for the great plains\nAnd it'll come back the second would be um this is is a significant shift that's been induced by human through anthropogenic climate change in other words portions of Texas and Oklahoma are kind of drying out and that's very consistent with what we would see in some of the climate model projections of what would happen in the next thirty forty years\nIf we continue on the the uh what's called basically the business as usual emission scenario in regards to carbon dioxide so that would occur and\nOr higher temperatures in the southern plains and more drying out than we would definitely you know pop slate than this this eastward shipped in tornado alley since we're already seeing that used word ship\n'em in regards to a changing climate we think that there is probably a climate change scenario a component plant here but we're simply not able to say definitively one way or the other whether what this is that we're seeing\nSo those would be living in tornado alley don't stand down just yet a\nA sign of live in Texas or Oklahoma you could still every\nYour plan for your you know tornado season quote unquote but even then I don't really like saying he's in because we know tornadoes happen any time of the year jak they're quite commonplace in places like Texas and Oklahoma in the months of November through February yeah so we can never really let our guard down just because we're seeing trends on a very large climate scale\nVictor ... is a professor in the department of geographic and Atmospheric

opportunity to get out and meet the folks who lived next door and around the corner and that's the context for today's edition of our heels to toe project in which Texan share stories about their boots\nMy name is Paul Lester I live in Houston a I'm a retired banker and lawyer and my boots story dates back to my growing up years in Austin in the late Nineteen forties\nWe had a neighbor whose grandfather turned out was a well known cowboy boots maker\nAnd this was about when I first encountered\nIn the late\nNineteen forties um my father took my\nOlder sister and me trick or treating it was my first time out on that mission\nWas about five it was a very cold Halloween Night we went up and down the street calling on all the houses until finally came to the last house which belonged to Tommy done and boy about ten years old and his parents [noise]\nBy this time after ten or twelve houses I'd gotten the hang of trick or treat routine and not as fully confident we'll trick or treat\nThomas grandpa Mr done came to the door\nHe took a strong look at him and he said just a minute I'm going to go get my guy [noise]\nWell\nI dropped my bag and rented it for my father when he told me he must have done was just kidding but I didn't buy it [noise]\nLuckily my sister who is three years older and had a lock on street smarts than I had\nStayed behind on the porch waiting and finally Mr done\nReturn to the door to me he was surprising we still unarmed [noise]\nHeavy put some candy and those bags my sister held out to him or her own and my\nTommy done was about ten years old as I mentioned one time he gave my sister and me some leather cut out that he's grandpa made for him\nThere were greens and\nAll I'm ever bright red because that was always my favorite going fire engine red\nBut then the pieces were caught in the shapes of little animals and flowers and taxes\nMy sister not traded them among ourselves\nA you know I had an extra leave for an extra Bullhead or whatever it was ... she needed we trade them they were very nice little cut out in court you know kind of ...\nI Lived out of state for many years as an adult but when I finally moved back to Texas and somehow I heard about\nThese quality cowboy boots made by Tommy's grandpa the legendary Charlie done Charlie done what from what I heard about him stance what I've learned about it you know I'm In
