there's doctors and lawyers and accountants and it makes me wonder how many of your panelists have had a beer with a welder and the last\nSay five years because those are the people that were left behind by the last three decades of the American government media policies yeah and those are the people elected President Trump\nAfter voting and live sort of the fifty key counties in the mid west twice for Obama right out of options are out of hope and when they watch and listen to the media there not talked about at all\nWhen I get what you get what you're saying James I I hear you in terms of concerns about bias and public media NPR many media outlets in terms of the success of Fox News I totally hear you on that and I think you make a worthwhile point quite frankly I Would ask you though James what that has to do with eleven people being dead\nWhile the connection that your panelists made earlier saying that you know the way that the president communicates which I'm not a fan of it it can or bottle like why do it when you can overdo it you know I Do think he's one of the most cynical politicians in the history of American politics\nBut there's tons of studies and I have a master's degree and you're making an education perception of the new law school at Syracuse\nAnd they all said the media tells people do what think about their agenda studying process\nIt does not for people to action it actually doesn't really have much effect in forming their opinion\nCan actually knows how much how much media set the agenda well how much responsibility\nWould you put on President Trump in terms of the current tone I mean he bears some of it doesn't it\nWhile I don't know Charles Barkley would say you know I'm not a role model for both of these people are clearly you know not well\nRight Charles Barkley is he's not a role model but he collects that check for every pair of shoes that were sold what's his name on it how much do you think that President Trump is responsible for the tone in this country\nFor the tone in that country I think he's the symptoms not the cause right\nI'll grant you that I mean he was elected but but James how much and I I Know our time is short I'm really sorry to cut you short James but how much do you think President Trump is responsible for the tone in this country\nFor the tone in their country I'd say he's no Fifteen twenty percent responsible budget right I mean\nThe overwhelming majority of the political discourse country for the last Twenty years has been down this line he's just wait better at it than anybody else right so that's why I say he's not the cause symptoms gushing so you can point fingers at\nYou know the answer is below sea and Newt Gingrich it's been going this way a long time or the finger at Karl Rove he's a good at you know person at all\nJames I hate to cut you short or just about out of time I appreciate your calling in do I want to end with the words of a famous Pittsburgh reindeer

like releasing that vow letting people go forward\nWith their ankle monitors and all that kind of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement released a statement saying the release began on October twenty third due to the limits and there are thirty\nThe statement reads in part after decades of an action by Congress the government remains severely constrained and its ability to detain and promptly vermouth families with no legal basis to remain in the U.S\nAs a result family units continue to cross the border at high volumes and are likely to continue to do so as they face no consequences for

counterintuitive are a lot of our listeners may sort of wonder could this be real that the number of severe weather I'm a situations related to tornadoes and hurricanes has actually been declining how how\nWell this year has been at least for for a tornadoes or a very good year for taxes we ride very few of them\nAre you know normally are severe weather season is primarily April May and June\nAnd I think it just so happened that during this particular year we we did not get the right kind of weather systems that allow that to happen or there were these a number of tornadoes um farther north and further East I'm even believe it or not\nWyoming as more thrown out of Texas wow\nI'm which we don't mind particularly but I think this is really just so probably a lot of things we don't really know about long term trends on her because we haven't really been systematically looking for tornadoes until like around the\nMagazine argued virus a storm chasing got big so we'll have twenty years' worth of record Riley looked around well\nNow I Want to turn our attention to hurricanes because of course we had a a quite a hurricane last year or what have you been seeing a so far this year\nThis year has come out a pretty close to normal when I'm really early to have about Thirteen named storms in the Atlantic ocean basin and the\nBack of the civil air am the view of the storm came ashore in Florida and the tremendous amount of damage\nIt only takes one started to make about hurricane season for the United states because of the potential for damage that from\nNow let me let me ask you something about that because of course we've been seeing a lot of rain across Lone Star state over the past us certainly several weeks and a lot of uh a lot of meteorologists are predicting another wet November\nSo do you think that these events are in any way a related or or just a a correlated into incidental\nOh so if you look at the big picture actually rainfall overall in Texas has gone up by about five or ... percent over the past century\nSo it seems to be getting wetter um in terms of extreme rain falls we get we get down to like very haven't ... mom or very wet day before the thing that causes flooding\nThere the the connection with climate change a little bit stronger and the for example after Harvey there have been several studies looking at a historic trends in rainfall and it seems that those super intense storms actually are producing\nOn the order of a tongue twenty or even thirty percent more intense rain than they would have if they have like a hundred years ago so a unfortunately this is what whether they have the ... the funny thing is probably being enhanced by\nThe warmer temperatures that we've been thing globally and the change of weather pattern that goes along with that\nAs you pull back and I know you're reluctant to do this but it what's the take away from you know fewer tornadoes\nOr an apparent reduction or at least a sort of the status quo when it comes to hurricanes and a whole lot more rain is there is there a way to tie it altogether and give us a sense of what we're looking at for the next five or ten years or is just no way\n[noise] well I think a conversation that kind of clear that you can't make blanket statements about extreme weather climate change doesn't make all extreme weather worse\nDoesn't recall extreme weather better we get to a warmer temperature of more heat wave and give us fewer and since there is a cold so each aspect of the weather then for a different way by changes in climate folks\nIs difficult to generalize in that regard um\nBut the things that are most competent about in terms of climate or are rising temperatures which are gotten above the background variability level in fact just sort of the ... century or so or noticed way hotter\nRainfall average ... still is quite variable so the trend has not really come out of beyond the round and half of the year to year river from so
