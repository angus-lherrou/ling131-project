organizing with like the best possible organizing the most organized you can go get singing\nOr unions are remain really important they are political salient is just different now not because they are weaker but because people are found other ways to organize\nSo we should like support unions and you're in organizing we should also validate those moms would just like set up a organizing thing in their their community like all of these are real and like they're still people who say like if you don't do it if you're not trained in this tradition like you're not a real in that sort of weird I
