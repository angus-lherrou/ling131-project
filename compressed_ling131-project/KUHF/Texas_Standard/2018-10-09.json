University in Cameron County Tony a weapon which actually standard\nThank you David First what do we know about what causes red tide and what makes it pop up when it does\nWell we don't really know exactly what causes that we know it's always out there a Texas a and M. did some research few years ago and found out that the bay of come paycheck is a source of our Texas Red tide blooms\nBad can paycheck border but it's on a map there because I I Want to make sure that our listeners understand where we're talking about\nIt's the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico off of Mexico between the you cut down and say Tamaulipas the state of Tamaulipas which is just south of us here in Texas\nTony when was the last time Texas experienced a red tide bloom\nWas in September when we had a red tide bloom occurred here in Texas I'm a device called a ... in the uh in Iran's is a Porter rounds has picked up a elevated numbers themselves I think it was like\nThirty cells in six middle leaders and that's a little bit elevated more than background and so Texas a and M. give gave us a a heads up\nBut it didn't last long and it moved more north um we only found background down here on south Padre Island but ah we're lucky we are dodged the bullet\nWhat was it what is it that people living along the coast actually fear of what what what is the danger that this red tide brings\nIt it's more dangerous for people that that have asthma or or a respiratory problems because the cell contains a neuro toxin called brother talks and\nAnd when you breathe it irritates her respiratory system so we\nPretty far we warn people with asthma to pretty much stay away from it or stay inside air conditioning and when you do have a heavy bloom the cells are called an armored ... and they break easily in waves in the surf and it ... says\nAnd so the aerosol is blown onshore usually if the wind is on shore and people breathe that not that results in in the irritation of the respiratory system\nBut there is no red tide in Texas right now I must say that whenever people here red tide they they think that we're having a blue but we are not in Texas\nSo how did how we become relatively lucky compared with our friends in Florida\nWe were lucky um you could probably attribute it to several several things um could be the wins the currents um we did have a cold water up well in this summer and red tide like hot\nComb water and we we did see the the coastal area I guess around corpus and down here\nIn the surf the temperature cooled down significantly and that could have inhibited any bloom that we could ...\nIt's not just the uh harmed that this can do to people who suffer from asthma but we're also talking about massive fish kills at least in the past year in Texas right\nYes we've had in the worst one we ever had was Nineteen eighty six and we lost twenty two million fish and the blooms spread throughout the whole state of Texas\nAnd um it was it was significant but not only do we lose fish mammals are susceptible we've seen a dogs die from a from inhaling we that we suspect phone that's on the beach and we've seen a Mexican ground squirrels die\nA pelicans hum hum we've seen lots of animals affected by it too\nSo I Wonder as we look at the situation in Florida you know whether there might be some lessons that we can take away and apply to Texas is there any way that we can preempt a red tide in in the future\nI don't think so it's pretty much a naturally occurring event um it is a Korean more frequently lately um I think we've seen over a dozen\nSince the Nineteen eighty six bloom and doesn't balloons in Texas um but before Nineteen eighty six there were only three reporters blooms in the state that we know of\nTony ... is a coastal and Marines
