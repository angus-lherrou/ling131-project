Ars Technica writes\nThis anniversary serves as a reminder that we can think then vice president Richard Nixon for NASA how so\nThey were burger joins us now thanks so much for joining us on the standard\nWas my pleasure thanks for having me on what\nRole did a Nixon play in shaping the mission to the space program\nWell after uh the the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in Nineteen fifty seven in the U.S was trying to figure out how to respond and the real question was whether it should be led by the military are led by some civilian space agency um that didn't exist\nAnd so it came down to President Eisenhower calling a meeting in February Nineteen fifty eight and the vice president was there and the president was leaning toward a military action that was his background um the military the army and navy had missile programs already underway and\nIt was actually Nixon and the president than his science advisor a guy named James ... who said wait wait wait no\nLet's think about this book for let's say if we're trying to win the hearts and minds out only of Americans of people around the world it would be a nice contrast 'em for the United states to have a program kind of out in the open you know non military peaceful purposes using space and so you would have the Soviet clandestine\nMilitary program and the United states where it kind of what became now so\n[laughter] it's it's fascinating to imagine Nixon making that argument especially when you consider his reputation over the years certainly ah during and after his presidency he was seen as someone who is\nAnything but transparent but here he is in Nineteen fifty eight making the case for NASA that a while retaining its military options I suppose in his applications nonetheless is a ... is trying to present itself as being opened in for the good of of all mankind\nYeah I think you know for all of his personal flaws and and Nixon certainly had many and in his presidency came through an egg nominees and I think you know his his political instincts are are pretty good and and here he saw\nYou know opportunity because if you think about you put yourself in the United states is back in the Nineteen fifties and sixties the country was behind the Russians in space you know they were doing all of the interesting thing and so this was a way to differentiate the United states and and sort of put it back\nOn a certain level above the Soviet Union at least in terms of morals\nWell though you say in your piece for our technical that uh this argument about having NASA as a as a kind of a fixture to benefit everyone is coming back into focus now how so\n[noise] well you know there was some real questions about where Nassar goes this century because the military was not particularly happy and I think that these and it hasn't been since that that the civil agency came in and and took over human space flight\nI'm so they're they're kind of encroaching on NASA and you've got commercial activities like space sacks and and they're doing interesting things there are encroaching on NASA and so there's there's a real question of what the space agency should do in the coming decades but\nYou know the fact of the matter is that no one else really land probes on ... sons spacecraft the outer solar system no one has flown by Pluto all these kinds of interesting things and so you know and that's it still has a a future in an expiration\nUm it's just it's it's got some issues both from the military interest and and then on the commercial side well\nI I'll say I mean you think about President Trump's proposal for a space for ... for example how does that square with NASA and its say next sixty years\nThat's a great question I think that's something that you know how to be you know work through 'em in coming years NASA you know technically have nothing to do with the state's worth that says it's an air force reorganization that sort of thing but out of that you could see air force astronaut at some point\nUm and kind of an erosion of Nassar's primacy of the center for putting Americans into space but presumably\nYou know so would retain it's er it's mantle as the civilians space program doing science and research in the open while the space force takes on a military mission\nYeah that that would certainly\n...
