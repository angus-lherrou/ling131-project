{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "This just think I'm Chris Boyd what did you learn about the ways that the threats of violence has shaped the experience of people who work at at reproductive health clinics Mm\n[noise] well it it's very interesting because when you you go to visit a clinic even one in Boston for example um where there are multiple clinics that you can choose from if you you you want to use their services\nUm there are metal detectors there are guards outside I'm now there are lines of protesters not like they're on the south but\nThey too have you know systems in place locked doors and one way mirrored up windows um but it's still it's it's really um shocking to walk past a gauntlet of activists [noise]\nYou know it's like we said nobody wants to have an abortion so you're there you're not feeling great anyway [laughter] and you know you have to ... you're literally running a gauntlet of people are screaming at you throwing things at you and handing your these little things called blessing bags which your bags full of things like soap pure L\nAnd baby booties and you know information about how you can give your baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion now what's really interesting is that you keep in mind that at these reproductive health clinics Ninety seven percent of Planned Parenthood's work\nHas nothing to do was abortions it has to do with cancer screenings an STD screening said contraception\nAnd healthcare women's health care\nSo lots of these people who are going into the clinics are there because you know maybe they're getting a gun logical exam and they're not even pregnant but they're being handed these bags and being told don't abort your baby I mean it it's a very uh ... situation for any woman to have to get healthcare and\n[noise] um you write that laws are black and white and you mentioned this earlier the lives of women are thousands shades of gray what can we do with the reality that these days a lot of Americans seem to prefer\nThinking about things in black and white terms we we prefer to skip past the the possibility that shades of gray might actually containment ...\nWell you know I I have a plan for that [laughter] [laughter]\nI Do um I actually think it comes down to stories and I'm looking at the the foreigners of you know of of this um of change let's leave it at that like for example I think that the reason we have a\nFederally recognized gay marriage in the United states is because it's something that Harvey Milk did which is encouraging people who are gay to speak up not to hide in the shadows but to to tell their parents to come out\nTo to make people realize that being gay is not some weird fringe thing but you know your neighbors gay girl cousins gay your uncle may be gay um you know any of those things so\nYou demystify this scaring us of of the whole situation and and when people don't know stuff that's when they imagine the worst [noise]\nSo I I realize it's an incredibly personal issue\nTo have an abortion and I also realize this is something that clearly stays with the women who have them [noise] but I Hope that there will be women who are brave enough more than just twenty five it as in my study to step forward and say I had an abortion and here's why let me tell you my story\nBecause I think even if you consider yourself to be pro life you may hear elements of a woman story that you recognize or that speak to you or that you can understand\nAnd that's the way we begin to break down that barrier of black and white we we literally show them all the shades of gray\n... so we may not solve the things we disagree about but we can solve the distance between people of different ideas yeah\n... exactly I think what we hopefully can do is get to a point where we are not judging someone else for making a decision we would not personally make\nThe newest novel by all their dirty Pico is called the spark of light Jody thank you so much for stopping by really appreciate your time\nWas my pleasure thanks for having me you can follow us on Twitter at K.
