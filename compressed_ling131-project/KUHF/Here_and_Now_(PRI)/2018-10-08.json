at the ministry of public security still is a Chinese national you question is an interesting one because you would imagine that it would be difficult for the head of the world's most important international at policing agency seemed to go missing book\nThat gives you an indication of the nature of the country that China is they feel that they can detaining the law says that they can detain him and detain they did\nAnd on what grounds well\nOn suspicion of taking bribes book as in the United states and Western Europe you might have to explain exactly what grounds you had the detainee somebody certainly in Britain you have to go before a judge and explain why he wanted to keep someone in custody you have to go see the evidence you had against him\nNone of that applies in China the law says they can help a particularly long time and then people held outside the legal framework anyway people sometimes just disappear\nTo be re appear at several months later or even after a longer period of time admitting they were guilty of something or a court case having being ... but anybody living in the west to use to our procedures and it seems very very strange in China it's no is there\nAny evidence or at least evidence that the outside world might respect I'm supporting China's claims that this man is corrupt and was carrying a bribery [noise]\nIt just simply no way to assess any evidence which has been leveled against them home way because we don't know exactly what he's being charged with um whether he's being held at the moment quite interesting the the ministry of public security issued a statement\nAbout a ... home way at on Monday which they explain they were holding him and it was kind of confusing statement but in that they said that the decision to investigate team was wise connect untimely the kind of language suggests they've already made up their minds on whether he's guilty or innocent\nAnd what could happen to him I mean we'll they're likely be a trial is that part of the the usual process there\nWill that will be likely ... usually comes after the Communist Party the ruling Communist Party conduct Eighteen vegetation and uh in my experience long years of covering China it's very rare that somebody is accused of something and then he's not found guilty at the end of that produce as\nMy best guess is that the next we'll hear about him is when um he's being cool and found guilty of a crime and perhaps submitted to hit and we've got a sentence\nThat the length of the sentence will depend on exactly and the nature of the crime of which we we no way of gauging looming\nMichael there were concerns that uh men would make Interpol an extension of the Chinese state or helping to arrest and extradite people is there any evidence that he did that\nThat was the criticism and that was a concern when he first took over the rules as presidents of er into polling two thousand sixteen ... know that really hasn't happened\nStrangely what has happened is that it shouldn't a light on China's a legal system by his detention I mean we're talking about um\nAn extraordinary situation in which\nAn on Sunday Interpol

is taking a terrible toll on civilians who are caught in the crossfire\nA civil war started there in twenty four team today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides the U.S backs the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not saying natural catastrophe it's a man made a trauma that is the results of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I mean neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of them the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you tell the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a on up Seventy percent of the country the truth is Eighteen thousand bombing raids there'll be led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted\nThe front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic goes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is the ... conflict between the who sees on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who's [noise]\nBut other than the other side from the Saudis the U.S in the u._k.\nExactly so immediately you have a philosophical splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death but at the same time there was a political emergency too\nAnd W. B. you are in the Boston Globe with less seen the new true crime podcast sponsored by Samuel Adams investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listen on apple podcast\nThis is here and now from NPR and W. B. U. R. I. Lisa Mullins the people's bank of China announced yesterday that it will reduce the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold by one percentage point\nThe move freeze up banks to lend up to one hundred Seventy five billion dollars to Chinese borrowers there's a scene is China's latest attempt to spur growth in the face of biting tariffs from the Trump Administration\nSome analysts of character as those tariffs as impulsive but there are now some people who think they may be a part of a grand us strategy toward China\nAre going to talk about that now with Jill lessons or she's business analyst with CBS News and host of Jill on money her podcast is better off hello Jill hello so first to telling steps of stocks in Shanghai of fallen Fifteen Percent since the beginning of this year\nAnd China's currency as we can to nine percent against the u._s. dollar so there are signs that the Chinese economy is indeed vulnerable uh the Chinese Communist party derives its legitimacy from continuing economic growth so how much is that growth and the legitimacy in jeopardy now well\nWhat the Chinese economy which is a twelve trillion dollar economy the second largest in the world\nIt's still going to grow this year probably by around let's called six and a half percent or so but a lot of problems at the country has faced predate the Trump administration's tariffs we know that\nThe manufacturing sector has certainly been hit recently but you know we've seen the pace of expansion of investment in houses and factories and railroads a key driver to of Chinese has actually fall in and and that was happening before the terrorists\nAt what we're seeing in this action by the government is an attempt to spur economic growth but also to make sure that everyone knows they still have a little gun powder left\nAnd that the Chinese economy is not going to spot or out of control without the government being involved it\nSeems as though the Trump administration's goal is to weaken China as much as they can but I Wonder how different things are from the Obama era the current White House uses\nA lot more bellicose language uh whereas back then Brock Obama called U.S China strategy appeal but at the core though isn't the goal continuing to try to stop China's rise I I\nKnow if it's to stop the rise I Do think that both administrations share one core belief and that is that\nYou know they want China to actually continue modernizing its economy but they are not so clear that they like these business in trade practices which essentially\nSay to the United states and the company's base in the United states come on cell you're good cheer you can operate but you're gonna have to cough up your technology or go into a joint venture with a Chinese company\nSo I don't think that we're trying to stop China I think we're trying to make the Chinese trade practices fairer and I think that has been consistent over the last dozen or so years and how effective is it\nWell you know right now we don't know and and I think that these trade tariffs have become really problematic\nOn in in essence because they start sparking other conversations we we hear Chinese officials saying hey you know you want to be really tough you want to start putting more terrorists another two hundred fifty seven billion dollars of goods well don't forget we're the key to North Korea\nSo this isn't just a trade issue it's a power issue and it does appear that the Trump Administration is trying to throw a wedge and they're getting allies on one side all lined up with new trade policies and then forcing the allies to kind of come with the U.S and freeze out China\nAnd try to really agitated for more reform we don't know whether it's going to be successful or not but it does seem to be a bit more strategic than initially thought Joe ... business analyst for CBS\nNews and host of Jill on money always nice to have you on the program thank you thank you
