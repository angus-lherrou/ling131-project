C.\nTo federal law enforcement officials tell NPR that the package soon to be Obama's was quote similar in nature to separate packages sent to the New York homes or former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire a democratic donor George Soros the Trump Administration has condemned whether it's calling the attempted attacks\nVice president Mike Pence tweeted these cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this country\nPresident Trump retweeted saying quote I agree wholeheartedly exclamation points Brakkton Booker NPR News Washington\nSources say officers of also intercepted suspicious packages addressed to Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder in California congresswoman Maxine Waters short time ago President Trump condemned political violence\nLose times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nThe critics accuse Trump Castle encouraging aggressive actions by his supporter base such as when he drew last from voters at a campaign rally from Montana congressman Gretchen forte who was charged with attacking a journalist's Trump said anyone who can do a body slam was his kind a guy [noise]\nTrump is seizing on and approaching migrant caravan as a campaign called tighten immigration laws in this country thousands of migrants from Central America are making their way north reporter Emily Green has been traveling with a group and says the migrants are more dispersed than in previous day's\nUnlike in previous days there was nobody lining the roads giving out snacks and bags of water many of the migrants say they're dehydrated\nThere continues to be relatively heavy police presence tracking the caravan and government helicopters are flying overhead but the Mexican authorities have made no effort to stop its passage\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the ... presidential campaign that the name calling and the the\nUm disparaging comments at a on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I said all I\nDo not equivalent what is it ... you see both sides do you think I mean the president is is using words like mob or you know do you think there's an equivalency\n... look the there needs to be a more civil town in the way we talk people on the left or angry and frustrated and speaking out and people on the right or angry and frustrated and they are speaking out and look at the end of the day\nWhat everyone needs to to take a take stock and and how we disagree how we express our feelings and I've said all along this this needs to be toned down because someone\nCould get hurt here and this was a time for us to take it take a step back and call for civility I I think a vice president Pence was right to uh certainly condemn the attacks uh\nThe the devices sent to the Obamas and Clinton's and CNN and now there are potentially others but these are cowardly acts in their despicable and they should not be tolerated and that goes for for those on the the right and the left but certainly this is just uncalled for and and especially in this is more than just a political\nStatement I Believe this is a a a threat on\nA freedom of the press and trying to silence the courageous men and women who work in the press I think they're trying to send a bigger statements that they need to decide what\nWill let me ask you a question uh Alice about something that we heard this week from President Trump he has been basically promising a new middle class tax cut that he says it's going to be put in next week\nBefore the election Congress is not in session that's not going to happen um we actually reach out to the White House to ask them to provide as somebody who could tell us more details about this new middle class tax cuts and they were not able to give us somebody to do that\n... what what is the strategy there to to make that kind of a promise when we all know that's not going to happen\nIn Germany as soon as I heard about the uh ten percent tax reduction I knew there was a hundred percent chance that was not going to happen for the midterms and and look this was something that President as done repeatedly he will say something that\nUh appeals to his base and that they want to hear and while this this is a good idea at a portion of this is to extend the existing tax cuts and another aspect of of this proposal is to put more greater emphasis on the middle class that needs to happen I talked to congressman\nSince this came about and and they support the idea but for it to to ... ... for this could happen before the midterm is is more than a stretch but he he was certainly saying that to to rally up his base and let them know this is something that he wants to work on at some point\nWhat do you think about that bill well you know the Washington Post said this week that the\nCampaign of two thousand and two on Donald Trump from Donald Trump's part is based on fear and false or so I think this is the classic false or not just not going to happen Congress was not in session and you can't put a tax cut through by through resolution\nUh and uh it's sort of like I'm from Washington trust me there's no way that he can say Congress was going to come back and automatically passes tax reform advocates just a cheap political gimmick that everybody sees through\nFederal ever looked but let me bring you in on something else because we we mentioned briefly the the caravan\nAnd some are wondering why we're not hearing from more Democrats explaining what it is and you know nobody wants to see thousands of people come across the border you know undocumented we just haven't heard them heard much from them and what we're hearing here in Florida I I you know we we're not hearing these kinds of ads\nUp and the New England area of the here's one that is playing constantly you know on CNN on a you know different cable stations it's I'm part of an ad from the Republican future forty five pack let's listen\nTo the far left moving to socialism on defended open borders immediate tax increases one hundred percent government run health care the booming economy has on and on our\n... running against the Democratic party I mean they end up in these ads saying do not vote for the Democratic party it will bring all of these things you know stand with Donald Trump's in many cases they're just\nThe whole party oh no absolutely well I think in response to your question Robert I Believe first of all I've been a little disappointed to that I have not heard Democrats stand up and say this is bunk I mean these are people who are seeking a better life and very few of them are going to make it through the border if they make it to the border\nAnd we haven't we haven't heard that I think the I I'm not speaking for democratic leaders but I think the reason is\nThat Donald Trump is clearly trying to make this the issue in the campaign he said the campaign is all about the caravan and Kavanaugh and common sense\nAnd I think they see that as a trap they don't want to walk into it because he is trying to make them look like they are for open borders and they're trying to keep the focus on\nThe economy and on health care particularly a and on what Mitch McConnell talked about last week that if you leave put the Republican leave the Republicans in power they'll go after Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security I think that's where Democrats would they'd rather focus on that and they don't want to be dragged into the guardian for\nI think that add it if if I can that ad but those key points to a Democrats for tax hikes open borders socialized medicine that as a a common\nIssue or common message that has driven up against many\nA Democrat specifically in the Senate races and there's not a lot of pushback because that is a there's a lot of truth to that in terms of where the Democrat Stan but let me just say this one quick thing on on the care of land that this administration issue and I could disagree on that right that's why we're there cannot [laughter]\nBut I Want to raise taxes to pay for education for instance I mean we've been hearing that today but go ahead go ahead just on on the care of and that the administration has mentioned this and I think it's a valid point\nDemocrats policies of catch and release and the loopholes with regard to those policies are an incentive for people to come into this country\nGranted a lot of people in the caravan are seeking asylum they are fleeing a danger in their home country but many of them come to this country because they know once they step one tell when America\nThey are the chances of them being sent back home if if there's a request is not granted it's minimal and that is a large in large part due to the Democrat catch and release policy that once they're here\nIf I may just step up with the fact is Donald Trump has been talking tough about to board or if you look at the end by the administration's own numbers more people have been coming to the word despite Donald Trump's tough talk uh than than we're a year ago and I want to put the caravan with drugs in perspective\nJust this is calm down everybody this is the second Caribbean this year the one in April Fifteen hundred people made it\nTo the American border two hundred and fifty applied for asylum of whom three three people were given a silent this is not and the salt on our country\nNear the writing of the late here in America is worried and we're exporting out that if they were to walk the whole time and not sleep it would still be up in more than a month to get to the U.S actually we have just a few seconds left and I want to ask you for literally five seconds ooh protection bill press for the midterms at this point a couple of weeks at\nA I Would say the house was going to take back of the Democrats are going to take back the house they will take back maybe fifth ten Fifteen the governorships of thirty six and I believe Republicans will hold the Senate barely you filibustered but ... go ahead [laughter] Republicans\nWill pick up some seats in the Senate I think it will be close there's a chance Democrats when and how\nHow Stewart Republican strategist and bill press democratic hosted programs to build pressure thanks to both of you thank you\nShare maps and you're in\nThe mission of NPR and news eighty eight seven is different from other media the outcome of a reporting is it better informed public not clicks or ad sales not that there's anything wrong with that but we think a

the finish line so we're hoping to hear from you right now\nThis is also one of our community partner days in this time you can give the first music lessons to child in a region courtesy of a FAA or I can see from our news department is here to tell you more\nIf you're wondering how news eighty eight seven partnership with al ... works it's a fairly simple equation you make a donation to support the news information and education mission of Houston Public media\nAnd then that gift will activate a free music lessons from al ...\nFor a child from an underserved community first lessons are always the hardest to initiate so your contribution to ... will be the catalyst\nSort of recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like\nA book of this part of a book list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do I just make for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibilities to lead the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future court a hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher\nLet's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland\nNice even person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is an office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointment so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course one to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky queens\nUm all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for the decisions and so forth record how important is is\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd to this particular Supreme Court so the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent is a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by our state radical groups to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to hell is is that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raising it to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nWay you know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got this big decision you know you've got to speak what they they do a lot of people don't know about it\nA lot of people don't know about it and it's been flying under the radar for years you know this has been a conversation at a question that has gone back really for decades um we had the first attempt to do this and twenty fourteen through a constitutional amendment\nThat would have given the power to basically Governor Scott and that failed so this is not the first time but I think once you get to these sorts of questions voters are just like I\nDon't really know you know they're not necessarily thinking that the balance of the Florida Supreme Court will rest and sort of the hands of the two men running for governor\nOkay well we'll see so this is a debate tonight or we're going to be hearing it at the ... again you know perhaps if will come up there but meantime while we have you in and your expertise\nWhat our Florida voters really caring about\nI think Florida voters are caring about a couple of things that have come thinking about the environment they're thinking about the economy um they're thinking about their taxes they're really thinking about hyper local issues and that's really sort of than some of the focus of this campaign in fact you've seen to Santa sort of struggling to pay has it\nReally to kind of talk about those local issues but Florida voters they're not thinking about the Florida Supreme Court they thinking directly about the issues that are impacting them the most\nWell I got to tell you in um we have been to the pan handle\nIt is stunning with this ... going through and I can't imagine that people are voting when they can even they have no place to live in so many pockets so you know it just wishing everybody the best here that's WFSU new stricter Lynn had her talking about how the Florida Supreme Court judges are kind of in the balance in the election coming up\nLynn thanks as always thanks for having is here now [noise]\n\n\nI'm
