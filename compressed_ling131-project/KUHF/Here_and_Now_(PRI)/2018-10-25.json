devices bringing the total number of suspicious mailings to tend\nTo suspicious packages intended for for a vice president Joe Biden were discovered in Delaware Newcastle county and in New York City police intercepted a package sent a business address linked to the actor Robert Deniro former bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives agent brag gal bond says investigators are now looking for clues about who put these packages in the mail\nWas used was duct tape was electric and create what color was it with their hair fibers were there any fingerprints and the place that you use ...\nAuthorities still NPR that some of the packages found this week included potentially explosive devices that are similar to pipe bombs cause you along NPR News New York well among the\nFirst targets of the apparent explosives was billionaire philanthropist George Soros is a major donor of progressive causes University in Budapest founded by the Hungarian American billionaire

the United states the administration has deployed eight hundred troops to the southern border with Mexico\nThey include military police engineers and other personnel to assist border patrol for the moment the caravan arrives\nDo you think will figure out who's doing this\nI'm sure that we will what I'd done for law enforcement and the past is a really research pipe bombs I've shot a hundred and thirty pipe bombs are looking at how they've fragment looking at how little material you can put in them to get a true destination\nUm the fragmentation said he really was if we could decide what had been in it if it had already exploded now in this case law enforcement is fortunate because they haven't tacked devices and nobody was hurt\nSo there's tons of evidence I think there'll be resolving this rather quickly\nWhat does it tell you that none of these so far have exploded\nI Hope it means we're a whole lot smarter\nAfter the anthrax letters a letter is a few years ago we we instituted a whole bunch of ways of of screening mail that we felt was legal the post office has a very strange little balance say try to maintain between privacy\nAnd a protection\nSo for government officials the the male and he goes through a screening protocol\nA I'm sure for some of these high profile people are like George Soros he has his own little protective protocol and looking at these so they were detected\nAnd now you can speculate that they didn't go off because they were only meant to scare and I've heard people speculate that but without knowing anything about how they're putting together we haven't seen anything that external pictures yet [noise]\nUm it's it's too soon to speculate that and it has to be treated very seriously and assume that we've done a great job on detection what\nWould be the first thing you would do to try to figure out where these are coming from\nWell\nLooking at the post mark and there was a post marks that I could see on one of the pictures are located where they might be sent from and the case of ones that were hand delivery I'm sure there knowing that ah there's gonna be a lot of video I'm evidence of where they're coming from [noise]\nUh there's evidence all over the outside of the packaging\nThat you can believe somebody is is going through and then in terms of the actual type or the clock all of that they're going to look for where this was acquired they're going to start in the area where they think the um bombs originated\nAnd move out from there to see who bought it I think each of this is on video more times than we think we are in this modern day and age\nYou say that we are getting smarter now does it look like the person who is doing this is a sophisticated attack or\nDo I think his sophisticated uh I don't think you have to be terribly sophisticated to do a a bombing of any kind\nThat's why it's all over the centuries it's remained popular uh ever since explosives were invented bombing has become a way of expressing\nUnhappiness or anger\nThat as Jimmy Oxley a professor at the University of Rhode Island who studies explosive detection mitigation in response to things just like what we're seeing right now thank you so much for joining us\nThank you let's go to Dallas now for an update on the shooting death of twenty six year old both of them John By Dallas police officer amber Guyger you remember when officer Guyger fatally shot Sean in his own apartment last month she was off duty coming home after a long shift she told police she confused his apartment for hers\nBut was a guy go acting as a Dallas police officer when she shot the twenty six year old black account and lawyers say she might have been and that could have big legal implications Christopher Connelly from member station K. E. R. A. looks at that fuzzy line between when an off duty officer is an officer and when there were civilian\nThere's still a lot about the ... of September sixth that we don't know details of what exactly happened between amber Guyger and both of them John but one fact that came out early has made it into practically every news story\nWas still wearing uniforms she claims she's with to the wrong apartment you still in her unit\nOr in uniform full uniform fill in uniform during the incident\nAnd that matters according to lead merit he's a lawyer for both John's family who says the family plants to suit not just Geiger but also the city of Dallas Merritt says Geiger uniform her badge the fact that she used her service weapon that she says she issued verbal commands to John before shooting him it all matters\nTo Mr ... to other members of the public she's holding their cell phone uh to be a police officer which effective and so badly she's operating under the color state authority and that would make her liable under Nineteen Ninety three in the city's well\nNineteen eighty three is a reference to the part of federal law that allows people to suit state or local officials for violating their constitutional rights Jennifer Lawrence teaches civil rights law at the University of Texas law school in Austin and she says the first step in bringing a lawsuit like this is to demonstrate\nThat in the course of undertaking that conduct that allegedly caused the violation that they that they were under ... that they were acting in the color of law that they were using their state authority in some way\nBasically that Geiger was acting as a police officer when she shot both I'm John that she was not just a regular person Laurence as the fact that Geiger was off duty is not necessarily the determining factor for a court to decide that\nA police officer even though officially off duty clocked out might still be using their official power or using the trappings that their office or using the authority that their position give than\nTo undertake a that actions that are complaining that\nIs John family lawyer Li merit can establish that Geiger was acting as a police officer when she shot John then he can argue that as an agent of the government she deprived John of his constitutional rights\nBut to go that next step to prove this city is liable for Geiger actions on that night that's more difficult says art render a Fort Worth attorney who has tried police misconduct cases\nTo hold her employer city ... if you have to show that there was a custom our policy of unconstitutional actions which that policy directly caused\nHis death guy goes attorney hasn't commented on the potential lawsuit and he's called the killing a tragic mistake\nIn a statement a spokesman said the city wouldn't comment on pending litigation but leave merit argues this city is liable he says Geiger relied on the Dallas police departments training when she decided inappropriately Merritt says\nTo fire at John he goes on to say that the city should have disciplined or retrained Geiger after a previous on duty shooting that was not fatal and for which Geiger was not indicted\nAnd finally merits says Geiger got the kind of preferential treatment from the department after killing both him John that's reserved for on duty shootings\nIt's that training and if that protocol and if that failure to discipline a that has resulted in a culture that's quite frankly out of control with the use of deadly force\nStill legal experts say these suits has a very high bar holding cities responsible for their police officers' actions is tough and in many cases they can drag on for years ... says he plans to file his lawsuit this week for here and now I'm Christopher Connelly in Dallas\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm Brandon rotting house and I'm Jay higher where the host of the party politics podcast from Houston Public media locally regionally a nationally politics is
