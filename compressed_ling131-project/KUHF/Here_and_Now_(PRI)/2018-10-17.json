[noise] All right so what are the challenges in your opinion Michael to appropriately re staffing all these ... agencies either two years or six years from now when another administration takes up in the White House\nUm so a couple of things um one is there is a\nKind of like it's a bizarre a silver lining but it's a silver lining\nUp until the moment Trump actually threatens enterprise with with destruction that threatens the to really dismantle the government\nIn various ways or it's not interesting enough for people to pay attention to I mean I wasn't paying attention to it and what we were as its think of it is it's like a squeeze it machine import especially important machine\nThat had been allowed to rust interest interest for Thirty years and then someone comes in with a sledgehammer the rough thing doesn't interest engage any of us but when a sledgehammer starts being wielded against it we start to pay attention to it so I think as you know he's electrified the material and this I think\nIs an opportunity for public education which might lead to renew all\nThe the ... before you reach staff all these play before you come in and kind of try to repair the damage [noise] um they really need it it's not going to happen unless there's a change in the narrative um so the narrative has been the government's the problem that the solution\nOr it's you gotta get get it off our backs\nAt ... ... it's going to require and this is why I wrote the book or it's going to require people to see that the government can be the solution and someone can sell who can sell that idea getting himself into the White House to attract the kind of people who you'll need to fix the mess that's being left behind as finished by saying\nI ... I interviewed a senator or I won't name him because I Can't remember whether it was even on the record but I was just talking to about how problematic it is from his point of view trying to to to make sure the proper funding goes to the proper places in the government when the White House has not asking for it\nAnd he was saying you know I'm afraid I'm going to spend the he was a young senator the rest of my career repairing the damage that created and that may be true\nMichael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk Michael really interesting ... thanks so much for making time for instance [noise]\nIf you'd like to follow us on Twitter are handled is AT T E R a thinking we do hope you become subscribers today to the podcast is always free and it's available using any podcast at like a he want to find out about the upcoming shows check the website thing dot K.

championing none of them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story in the masterpiece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug

reined in after the meters\nThat I'm having a job at a meeting a little while and we're going to ask every secretary to five percent selection\nClaire Sebastian and CNN Business correspondent she joined us from New York where is that proposal to cut cabinet budgets by five percent going to go anywhere the president has tried to get a his cabinet to cut things before and it hasn't\nWell I mean this has to be approved by Congress had before he wants to he wants to do this often times when presumably at will have a bit of a new picture when it comes\nTo Congress so it's not clear if that would go anywhere and it's not clear to me that that gets to the root cause of the problem has spending among government agencies to ticketing non minute G. ones actually some of them a decrease last year rather than increasing the big increase in spending\nThat we feel we're in interest on the debt that the government has obviously that is going up as the government bars to fund that spending on Social Security and defense so we see in a bipartisan agreement on increasing spending so I think it's going to be a tough sell but certainly if he manages that it might help produce that after\nThat

five trillion dollar Republican tax cuts that Republicans said would pay for themselves but clearly they haven't\nThey haven't uh this is this initially when the Republicans saying it's not just that the president and Mitch McConnell we've had it from the treasury secretary go at that this is this is due to spending which is largely driven by the Democrats but actually if you look at the numbers are spending as it went up three percent but government tax receipts was flat\nAnd they should have been going up this is a strong economy where people would be paying more taxes and you know there was some increases in individual in self employment taxes which were driven by economic growth but that that's the bottom line is the corporate tax cut isn't she\nMade that council that out so we have a ... tax receipts a flat dislike despite the booming economy and that really can only be attributed to the gym tax gotten\nWhat about the terrorists are they helping out at all to be charging a fee
