always good to talk to you thank you\nThank you Jeremy and let's get the latest now on that group of several thousand migrants that has made its way from Central America into Mexico\nThis morning President Trump tweeted that he would start cutting off or reducing aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping the migrants joining us now is Alan Gomez he's immigration reporter for USA Today and Alan what's the latest where are these migrants now and what conditions or their face and\nThey have crossed into Mexico there in very very southern Mexico right now so they still have a very long way before they reached the southern us border [noise] um but the conditions that they're in right now are very difficult um there's a nest emitted five thousand of them now I'm ...\nStarted off as a pretty small care of him starting in Honduras but just people have been a jumping on board as they've gone from country to country and the difficult to know is a\nGroups are offering to help them out the red cross was down there but a lot of people in the caravan are worried about leaving the caravan for anything\nUm so they're all trying to stick together which makes it hard to find anywhere for them to stay so their their code or staying on the elements of some of them have plastic though they're covering themselves up in um overnight but for the most part they're just kind of try to band together and going from than trying to find places to stay\nNow we've seen these caravans before earlier this year in fact but why is this one this large is it spontaneous or they're you know people behind the scenes are organizing this\n[noise] I think it's a bit of both to definitely start out these these curve as they've done this for years a court ragweed because\nWhen you're making that long Journey Through Central America it can be an incredibly dangerous thing to do um do you get attacked by people on the way I'm I've talked to so many of these migrants who've been through these who told me horror stories of rapes of assaults of robberies\nAnd so they started these curve and several years ago as a way to protect themselves\n[noise] um so it was planned to a degree but the size of this is definitely been a bit more spontaneous because um they see the reports of it they say hey this was my chance and they'll run over and then joined the group\nNow President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on countries like Mexico to do something about this to stop them as they move north clearly government officials from Mexico haven't been able to do that yet have they been trying\n[noise] there's there's been different\nLevels of effort let's say I'm a Central American nations Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador um they tried to kind of slow them down a little bit but Mexico now all the focus goes to them\nSo right now Mexico's in a very difficult position they're getting a lot of heat from the people with in Mexico and Central America to allow these folks to pass but at the same time when you have President Trump\nI'm kind of hovering over you making these threats threatening to send the military to the border threatening to seal the U.S border which would be economically disastrous for Mexico it's a really tough position for them and they're trying to walk that\nLine and it does seem like President Trump is trying to in a way use this to his advantage he's telling his Twitter followers that there are criminals and unknown middle Easterners mixed into this group and of course we don't really know if there's any basis in fact for a claim like that but\nDo you think Democrats should be nervous about this caravan heading north just about two weeks before the election when the president is trying to use it to fire up his base\n[noise] when you look at the political aspect of it is yes this is\nThis group really the timing of it has been a difficult because it's injected this issue so quickly into the midterms I'm President Trump has not been shy at all he's talking about it all the time Republicans like I can tell you I've been hearing from watching the races are\nIn in the middle of America They're talking about this Honduran caravan um\nThere are accusations that democratic operatives that George Soros was behind all this that they're paying for these for these caravan people but [noise] you know I've also talked to some folks who say actually this is it might as well have been paid for by the Republican Party because the idea of showing these images of these folks marching\nTowards the United states as they put it in trying to invade the United states it's been on a constant loop on all sorts of conservative media um it's being used and you don't just congressional district debates all over the country in the last few weeks um and so this is something that plays into their hands\nThat said Allen how do you see this plane out if and when thousands of people do arrive at the U.S Mexico border\nWell we'll see a lot of what's been going on where they'll try to get in it and then it becomes a question of how quickly the U.S can processes asylum claims [noise] um and and what the resolution of those cases will\nBe All right we'll be watching and civil Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today\nAlan thanks for your time thank you this is here in [noise]\nThis is Eric ... of this American Life and you hear these projects come you had them go chances are you've had never donated to this public radio station and I think the reason why is because you think that we are talking to someone else and I just want to say we're not talking to somebody [laughter] we're talking to you look at yourself right now you\nAre someone who sticks around and listen to the station even during the pledge drive [noise]\nWhat does that say about you look at your own behavior who argue who is the person who listens to the public radio station even when the pledge drive is going on this stuff I'm saying right now they can come out of the radio it's not even interesting but yet he did not turn the station what does that say that you\nKnew they were actually trying to reach you personally\nIf I knew your name I Would say it right now\nAnd what we're asking you to do is an act of pure idealism because you know\nIf you've been listening to the station for a while chances are you know rationally that you don't need to call you know the station is still going to exist and that's supposed to say that you're not supposed to say that in place at the station is going to be\nFine it's going to exist even if you don't call you know rationally because you never called and we've all stayed on the air with that you and so for you to call it an act of your ideas and you're doing it even though you don't have to do it which makes it even better\nAnd the thing I Would say is that those of us who work here we're working here out of ideas were working here because we believe in the mission of his radio station\nAnd I just have to believe that if your hand in hand to my voice right now\nIf you listen all the time if you stick around during the pledge drive you have some small feeling of idealism about this radio station\nOr at least you find it useful in your life [noise]\nI Do that's why I pledge joined me and all the other people who act in that idealism even though you don't have to because you know that it's you know that we're talking to right now don't they don't\nDelay do it now and things\nYou can go to Houston Public media's not org where you can call us at eight eight eight nine zero nine\nZero eight seven either on Michael ... from Houston matters zero news eighty seven and\nToday we're on the air to ask for your supports and your contribution to pay for the news and information you would lie on every single day like I said to that optimism that sense of idealism that you have it's probably runs hand in hand with the the the difference that you you're in public radio programming\nThe lack of commercials the lack of yelling the\nEnded up conversations the news from around the world in right here at home it's all part of what makes us different in that ah that were left kinda last bastion of civilized debate and conversation a news on the radio and public television as well so less supports\nThe public radio station
