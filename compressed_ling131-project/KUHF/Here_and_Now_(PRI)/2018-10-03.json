university\nUh Peter welcoming first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test tube explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates\nThere they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery and the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell or being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that so live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry Senate beak or a flask\nWho we control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we'll alternately observe\nBut in a you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker\nAnd I'm the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur in the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary processes is is really what so spectacular here\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications all this\nWill be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but\nThis is here now from NPR and WB you are I'm Peter

lot to hit production goes over the years we've talked about that here on the show so how big of a deal is this news that it's finally hit that mark well this is\nThis is getting you know this is something that they really needed frankly in the recent questions over that credibility particularly when it comes to communications with the market and you know unless it was very bullish about this over the weekend he sent a message we know to\nTo stop an email saying that he needed to give it one will push and they were very close to profitability ... tons of whether this means they will at profitability that down unless they're a bit divided on that some say that that it does show you know that this this is helpful or you know data point in the past ... at the others are worried\nAbout the challenges the company is facing when it comes to deliveries we know that must be in the past and says about production hell now he's been talking about delivery logistics how he called it and that did show up and the number the bet they had a back of the vehicles lifted in transit about twelve thousand of them that's left in the last quarter\nBut still a significant number so I think that's why we see for the second day running now after that initial busted enthusiasm on Monday the stock price is down\nAnd just to note about profitability Tesla has never had a profitable year\nThat that's true and and at their at them they'll question hanging over this yeah mosque has promised repeatedly that that in that court and the fourth quarter\nThey will show a profit and they will be cash flow positive and they said he said the topic of the weekend was very close to that ... and they've been cutting costs as well as increasing production they've laid off nine percent of that stuff\nThat we saw recently that they ... some of the color options available for the motor three to cut costs as well but but Castro is still a big issue for this company they got that coming Jupiter in November and some next year so they're getting to profitability Seventy from the enlisted covered this that I've been speaking to a is not something that they see as guarantee\nYou listed a lot of the reasons why the headlines about Tesla are often negative so let's talk about this one earlier or the SEC settled a with you on must after he had this tweet the claim to have the funding secured to take Tesla private\nThere are reports that most kids threatened to resign at one point if the board decided to settle so some last minute change of heart some drama do you think that to us a Tesla Elon Musk are ready to put that behind them I mean do you think it will do much long term damage\nI think they were extremely ready to put that behind and we saw how much of an overhang hadn't stuck by the fact that it went up Seventeen percent on Monday or that they said it has come back down again\nThat's not the only overhanging they have they still are department of justice investigation that that is hanging over then that could potentially lead to criminal charges although some experts I spoke to said\nThat the settlement with the SEC potentially makes that less likely I think the ... not ready on the board there being questioned throughout all of this ... about their independence we know that there are several uh old friends if not then not to mention because\nHis
