at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their teams take care of themselves\nRecognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of one she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a severe infection I'm a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult in desperate\nSo you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nWrite for exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nDo you think this is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project
