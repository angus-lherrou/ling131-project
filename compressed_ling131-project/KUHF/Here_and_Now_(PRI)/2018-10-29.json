to the energy difference between those two of you know talk so sue soundbites this president went on script and he's given the words in front of him to read how he you know should sound presidential\nThen he goes and does that but you know listen to how these egged on there by the crowd that's the energy that's what fuels and that's what he thrives in and he understands the difference within himself that\nYou know remember during the campaign he said I could be so presidential I'd be so boring doesn't want to be that guy and that and he's going to\nDo everything possible to sort of fight doing that he has this habit of speaking out of two sides to that his supporters can say look he said the thing you want what else do you what else are you looking\nFor I also want to ask you about a theme that's been running through these past few days and it's anti Semitic conspiracy theories the mail bomb suspects sent one of his packages to George Soros the billionaire who's regularly a target of hate speech\nThere have been a number of conspiracy theories about Soros including that he's funding the migrant caravan and Central America I'm as we just heard from the last segment the Pittsburgh shooter has echoed this idea he cleaned on line that the Jews were responsible for the Caribbean\nWhat do you make of these theories making an appearance at both of these stories and increasingly them in the mainstream political discourse\nWell it's always been something out there and sort of the dark Web than in places you know where people are routinely harassed and\nIt's something that Trump the White House his campaign shouldn't be sensitive to you know whether inadvertently or deliberately during the campaign they ah you know wind up re tweeting white nationalist I N instead this president\nDoubles down and you know when he feel what they're sensitive to and what she's sensitive to is how the president is treated and perceived and you know they

a incivility in public life of course vice president Pence\nUh he was on a Sunday show this week and he was a arguing\nThat the rhetoric is bad overall that Democrats say things that are bad to uh and that he had a different style that President Trump But Trump's provocative style is exactly how he connected to the American people I think that gives a degree of cover to Trump supporters to say\nYou know look this is just something that's ginned up by the left and the media\nNow one more thing I Want to ask you about before we let you go we heard from Hillary Clinton or in an interview with Recode a when asked about whether she would run in twenty twenty or her answer was I'd like to be president I'm kind of remarkable could you could really be considering this ...\nWell I think she would like to be president [laughter] you know I'm not surprised by anything anymore in politics lots of people say they're not going to run than they reconsider it if there was a groundswell of support for Hillary Clinton I'm sure she would consider it and I'm sure that looking at the twenty ... twenty twenty\nPotential twenty twenty democratic field it's not a great field of candidates as far as understanding who there is no I shouldn't say that I should say that there it's not exactly clear who the potential candidate could be who would take on Donald Trump's so if you're a Larry

B. you are in the Boston Globe with last seen the new true crime pod cast sponsored by ADD smart home investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listen on apple pod cast\nFrom NPR and WB you are I'm Robyn Young it's here and now there are still more volatility on the stock market today which suggests some investors are already worried about twenty Nineteen terrorists and the Federal Reserve's actions to increase interest rates all loom large\nBut the biggest cause for concern is that the booze from President Trump's tax cuts\nSeem to be over Jill's lessons for his business analyst with CBS News host of Jill on money and her pod cast better off ... hello so those tax cuts uh you know just make people better off the juice the economy this year on track to have the best year growth since two thousand five\nBut ... why you know what isn't it last\nYou know I think that the the big focus of the tax cuts this year obviously was on the corporate side those were the ones that were the permanent tax but they were way bigger much more of the tax cut power went to companies and companies did go out and spend money and also bought back a lot of their stock and gave a bunch of dividends but they spent money\nIt looks like that spending may have peaked in the second quarter\nAnd now it does look as though global growth is kind of softening a bit we know China's cooling we saw some numbers today I from the government that personal incomes were just up a little bit in September that suggest that perhaps we are now peaking with consumer spending all this is kind of freaking out the investment community\nAnd making people look at twenty Nineteen as genes that may be a year where we're not going to see this three or three plus percent growth\nAnd then again that because we understood the token missed Asian thought that these cuts would change company's long term behavior that I'm cutting that corporate income tax would make investing is so attractive the money would come in from these corporations and from overseas but it's not\nNo no I mean look there's part of this is that companies are long term but they're not crazy either they want to see what's going on in the economy but I think we should layer on top of that there was quite a bit of uncertainty throughout this year around tariffs so we had the aluminum and steel terrorists still in place the solar panels of washing machines\nAnd this unresolved issue with China is looming quite large remember two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods we have terrorists in place those terrorists could rise from ten to twenty five percent in January\nAnd we also I hate to say this word because we haven't talked about in a while but we have a lot of uncertainty around Brexit and that has really prevented a lot of companies for making major commitments to there's more information and\nThese tax cuts have piled on the deficit um they're expected to reach a trillion one trillion next year\nYou know Mitch McConnell the Republican leader talked about how the tax you know this a deficit increase was because of huge spending and Medicare and Social Security and saying that they had to be cuts to that to offset the um the the debt others are are saying it's the tax cut would expect to be the economic consequences\nWell I mean look I'm not one of these people who I interviewed tons of economists all the times and some of them are people who think that deficit to the worst thing in the world I don't think that death is are the worst thing in the world however\nIt is mildly annoying that you have\nSomeone like McConnell start to blame the social safety net programs for a deficit one corporate tax receipts based on the last deficit numbers corporate tax receipts were down by thirty one percent\nSo yeah there is truth that the bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit\nCame because of that corporate tax real quick Julie got twenty seconds can these be rolled back uh probably not because I really would need to see a big gains for the Democrats in the
