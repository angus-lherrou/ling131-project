now from NPR's Mara Liasson\nIn a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House President Trump said he successfully negotiated determination and replacement of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement he says he has a new pact that he's named the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nSome of the terms of the new agreement are significant others are minor but President Trump says once the deal is ratified by Congress hundreds of thousands of new jobs will begin pouring into the country Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nAfter announcing the new trade deal President Trump answered reporters' questions about the FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh president is disputing claims that the scope of the probe is being limited\nI think the FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason\nBut you have to say within reason they

Rob Stein has details\nThe drug called ... it's long been used to treat the bones inning disease osteoporosis but there's been a big debate about whether it might help prevent factors in people it earlier stages of bone loss\nBut are his supporters gonna view it that way or is this a win as far as they're concerned\nYeah I mean if if his supporters of dairy farmers they're going to be happy for supporters work in the car manufacturing industry I'm sure they're going to be happy I'm you know in terms of the biggest losers here it's not yet entirely clear I think that people who support Donald Trump\nIt has been shown in poll after poll they basically support him no matter what\nAnd this isn't a bad trade deals it it's a it's a fine trade deal it's just extremely subtle compared with the criticisms that Trump had for the previous trade deal and it should be said that in twenty sixteen\nAs a part of the TPP a negotiations the Trans Pacific partnership negotiations Obama's team was negotiating with Canada and Mexico and actually extracted\nMany of the exact same benefits that Trump has now extracted from those countries in twenty Eighteen\nAnd so I think the confusion here for a lot of economists said if you're going to take Trump's seriously when he criticizes NAFTA and when he pulls out of TPP as he did in his first week as president is\nIf your if there was all this bluster about how bad these trade agreements are and then two years later you're basically just reenacting them and putting a new name on it than what exactly we've been talking about to last year and a half\nWell what does it mean for the manufacturing industry in this country which President Trump has been focused on since before he became president he's been telling people and a lot of states in the mid west especially that you know we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to the manufacturing industry in this country is going to boom again\nRight so I'm the one hand it's important to say the steel tariffs remain in place or they might open up more negotiations in the future with Canada ... but for now the steel tariffs remain in place and that's something that these steel manufacturing industry quite legs\nBut whenever we're talking about manufacturing it's important to say let's define what a comeback is in Nineteen Seventy nine there were twenty million manufacturing workers when Trump became president there were twelve point three million now there's twelve point seven million right so we've added four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs\nIn the last Eighteen months that's not bad manufacturing jobs are coming back but we're never going to have anything close to the Nineteen seventies economy again\nAnd so you know when I talk to economists about you know how do you plan the economy the future they say well planned for the economy\nOf the future don't try to create the conditions\nTo to grasp for the economy that we had in Nineteen Seventy nine and so it just seems like there's an enormous amount of effort being placed on creating conditions for the revitalization of a tiny tiny part of the U.S economy which isn't steel manufacturing when\nIn fact we were just in Indiana a recently doing some reporting on manufacturing there and one of the problems that they say that they have in the industry there is that we've got the jobs we just don't have workers that are trained to do\nThe new manufacturing jobs dark or just in the thirty seconds that we have left here what do you think that this news about the\nUs when we called us MCA us new NAFTA or what does that mean for countries that the U.S government is still in sort of trade disputes with thinking about the European Union in particular\nThe European Union and China a you know if this gift some confidence that history strategy is working that might embolden him\nTo hold out on China um it might I'm old enough to hold on the European Union as well on the other hand if you take the outcome of this negotiation on his face and you say Trump is going to have a lot of bluster there's going to be a lot of criticism of the status quo but you're going to end up with\nThe status quo I mean to be clear us MCA not to a to point out whatever you call it\nIt's basically exactly what the Obama administration had toward the end of twenty sixteen and so if that's your precedent then you're going to and you're going to have a lot of last year but ended up essentially where we were two years\nThere Thompson senior editor at the Atlantic thank you thank you it's here and

dinner\nJoining us now is just a singer business analyst for CBS News and host of Joe on money her pike asked is better off high Joe hello so tough day for Jon Flint or read a book gone after less than a year on the job what what's behind this\nYou know this is a company that was really trying to change direction it came in with too much debt to the financial crisis not enough grows and recently got kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average and it's been quite a turnaround this is a company that really was sort of the the symbol of manufacturing then became the symbol of like the great American conglomerate\nAnd frankly it's been shrinking since the financial crisis and if you look at the performance just over the last year the stocks down by almost forty eight percent from a year ago so\nIt was really going to be tougher flattery to keep his job for much longer unless he showed significant results which apparently he did not yeah exactly I mean look this is this is a company that I should say that you know he had a tough job coming in right so he there were there to sell off major U.S health care transportation oil and gas and this happened after\nThe company downsizing spun out its financial arm G capital\nSo I I really think that it was tough but clearly he wasn't going fast enough for the board of directors even understanding the constraints that he came into the job facing\nSo the new CEO is Larry Cole who's been on cheese board for several months although he is the first outsider ever to run gee what else can you tell about\nWell you know he is the CEO of that conglomerate ... which is a much smaller company then GE he was a he served as the c._e._o. from two thousand one until early twenties Fifteen\nHe was very young CEO he came into that

hundred sixty five percent compared with about a hundred five percent for the S. and P. five hundred during the same time\nI guess that maybe the board looks at\nCold as perhaps someone who could really successfully navigate the downsizing of a conglomerate and the focus that is necessary to build business units where essentially you can make money really focusing those efforts is important\nGE also said it would take a good will charge as large as twenty three billion dollars for its struggling power division what does that mean\nThat is one of those great things on Wall

essentially saying we ... we are losing more money in this this is probably associated to the twenty Fifteen acquisition of the power business of\nUh France has also ... which was a lot of people thought this was going to build up jeeze power business you know get back to its roots but\nObviously this has backfired global demand for power generation declined and uh you know that's a twenty
