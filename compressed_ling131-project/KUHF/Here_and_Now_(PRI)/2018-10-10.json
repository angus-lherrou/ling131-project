was it was definitely it was upsetting at the time for sure\nThis is think I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right let's go back to the phones we have not calling now from Austin Hi Matt\nHi [noise] I'm I'm actually\nWas really entry listening to everything um originally connected with my biological father left over from Paraguay and you actually know how to trial and um and as we connected you know\nIt was your school how it's something he was and and the knowledge and everything and I'm always knowing that I was adopted and people will ask you this question that I wanted to ask you and I'm sure you're going to show\nIs um have you ever considered a adoption of something that you would pursue your own life for your own family\nThanks for calling um thank you for sharing that I have considered it I um my husband and I have talked about it\nBefore I think that I think we both really like to foster V. foster parents um whether that's temporary or whether it led to adoption one day it's something we talk about a lot um so yeah it is it is something that I've considered and would consider in the future\nDo your ah your kids look like you [noise]\nUm yes [laughter] I guess I think they do mhm\nI Wonder if you I mean I think a lot of biological parents sort of delight in the resemblance if they have 'em to them and their spouse but I Wonder if you feel like it's it's something that mattered more to you based on not having looked like anyone in the family you grew up in [noise]\nYeah I mean I Can't compare being adopted and not being adopted and then becoming a parent but I Do remember right after my daughter was born just like looking at her and realizing she has my nose\nYou know a her eyes or brown like mine her came in darker like she heard our skin tones almost exactly the same just things like that I Would notice um and still do like the shape of our faces it's they're they're very similar um and I look a lot like ... both my kids with a lot like me and very different ways\nUm and certainly that meant a lot just having grown up never seen you know myself in the faces of the people I Love the most\nUm and it was interesting to how like really at the same couple of weeks that I was becoming a parent I was reconnecting with my sister Cindy so seen pictures of her for the first time like as I was becoming a mother\nYou know it was I was seeing like two different versions of myself but like two different biological relatives who are so close to me\nUm that I never had this experience before and here he was having it like doubly that that really meant a lot to me\n[noise] so\nI have to imagine writing the story it's not exactly the combination of everything right because this is still ongoing it's still your life you're still making sense of all this but what was there something about completing a draft of the book that made you feel like\nThere's an aspect of this part of my life that I can at least set aside and now it's not sort of front and center in a way that it has been\nThat's interesting I I really do I felt I felt very satisfied on finishing the draft um I I was\nReally I was glad to be able to share it with um with my families you know the different people in my life um I sent early versions to almost everybody\nUm and that that meant a lot um partly because I didn't want them to be surprised by anything I wanted them to have a chance to help me fact check or correct the record 'em and just give feedback\nBut that was really meaningful talking about it with my adoptive parents in particular I felt like you know we'd already been talking about some of these things we didn't talk about when I was growing up but um and we talked about them while I was reconnecting with my birth family and after that the book also kind of forced to new ways and I think it was overall a very good for us\nAnd good for them to be able to read at length you know what it was like for me what I remember um and just have a chance to really share that as a family um that was really meaningful to me\nUh and I I think it's good to that I wrote the book when I did I don't think I could've written it while everything was happening I don't think I could have written that even just a year or two after reunion I think I really needed the time to think I'm process and figure out\nHow if and how to tell this story um and what what about it would be like worthwhile hopefully to others um so I'm I think also the timing of it felt good to me like it felt like now with the right time\n[noise] Nicole ... is editor in chief of

first priority I'm certain is to make sure those residents were okay\nFor ... for a ... he's kind of got the same situation as Governor Scott who's got the ability to really show people his leadership show people the way he's going to manage a crisis and in a very intimate real way people will see him being a leader in the course of this\nRace this is something that the the dynamic Florida is very interesting because even Democrats who I talked to in the states say\nYou know sooner Nelson as having some trouble he's an insider well Scott is kind of trying to take them on\nAnd sit and they'll send is not really doing the same kind of campaign work to go out and get the new Democrats Andrew Gillum is is bringing into the race and try to appeal to them I think the ... campaign thinks those Democrats who vote for him automatically the people in the ground say not so fast you got to go get them\nSo the both the Scott ... campaigns have the opportunity to really show their muscle during the storm\nIt's funny because there's so many other issues that these people have been campaigning on all along and now this storm could really change the dynamics of the race house\nCertainly and and Governor Scott when he ran for governor in twenty ten when I worked for him his uh\nHe had three priorities that was jobs jobs and jobs and he said that once he said it a thousand times and and that is what he's been able to\nProvide for the people of Florida and and has a good record on that but also what he is as done speaking of natural disasters the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico a lot of

resources that they need and that will go a long way to to not just providing for the people there but the Hispanic community that is so critical to that vote\nIn the Senate race so so his ability to

meetings in twenty ten during the debate over Obamacare a ... is it the same thing\nOh I Do think it is the same thing and not only that McConnell called the attacks on a judge Kavanaugh as coming from a mob when they were just people standing outside you know voicing their opinions and and being arrested and peaceful protest\nBut the people inside of a of a political rally shouting lock her up to a political opponent of what the president United States mild reaction of that's not a mob\nLet me just say this to tea partiers never went into Iraq private restaurants and chase senators out of
