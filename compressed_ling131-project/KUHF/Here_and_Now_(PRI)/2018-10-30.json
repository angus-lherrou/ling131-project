in the film she says well\nIt's kind of what are you going to do if if most of your friends are there and you might have friends all around the world are all around the country and most of your family there and that's the place where people share things and that's where you're going to be too and you have to decide whether you're comfortable with their business practices because you can always opt out\nFIFA think I'm Chris Boyd All right let's talk next with Edward in San Antonio Hi Edward\nHi there thanks for taking my call earlier you were discussing how Facebook doesn't strictly so data but they do offer a space based on aggregation so that data and\nEarlier this year I heard a little bit about that and getting them in trouble with like equal housing on them and I'm Wondering if they're more applications that we have it may be seeing or maybe things that work backing up and down the road\nThanks for calling in fact said were there at that yes it's a it's a it's a distinction that the company is very keen to make that they don't sell data and that they don't share data with advertisers and the the the the trouble that they got in an or potentially in more trouble for is the fact that they were\nYou can customize the audiences that you want to reach if you're an advertiser um and ah and Facebook enables you to kind of\nSegment up and offers you different segments of people if you want to reach them\nAnd in some ways you could do it ... you know demographically in some ways you could do it racially in some ways you could do it\nUm geographically and there's all sorts of ways to segment up and they did get in trouble um because of fair housing laws because you can't discriminate and so the question is whether the segmentation up\nA of of specific targeting of specific groups or you don't want for instance African Americans to these showing an ad for your housing development that you've built or you don't want\nJews to see an ad for something there there there were ways to basically do that and and face because now eliminated I think about fifty different categories from their ad targeting tools that you can't use any more\nUm [noise] but it's an ongoing\nQuestion as to how they're going to deal with this and whether the the the fair housing laws will will kick in and there'll be any accountability for what they were enabling\n[noise] can you relate to the problem that Facebook feels too essential to quit can I relate to that can you relate to it and to the idea that that like your friends are there and where how else I interact item I absolutely\nCan relate to it I absolutely can I think it's if it ... you know it's called the Facebook dilemma for lots of reasons because there's so many different dilemmas but yeah\nI mean I it's it's here I've got this this film that's come out and where am I going to share it you know besides sending in a group email where am I going to share with my friends and family are the people that I haven't spoken to in years where I'm going to share that news like hey watch this thing um and it's and\nIt's with a you know tinge of irony that I posted there but I did and um and\nIt's it's good for that and I I Would never want to paint this as a ... you know this is an incredible invention what Mark Zuckerberg has done here and there is a lot of good that this invention is brought\nAnd it didn't it really interesting product but um we're kind of I I Do feel stuck to some degree and I don't [noise]\nGiven all that I've learned about the company I'm you know I Do think that uh there's plenty of really legitimate questions about the ethics of actually participating on Facebook\nAt the very top of the conversation you mentioned my space and I'm probably folks there could not imagine there would be a time when it was basically irrelevant it would seem that the space is open for a competitor to come in and provide better safety guarantee is not the same kinds of mass appeal Facebook has has anybody close to that\nNot not that I Know of 'em and and what's interesting is that Silicon Valley kind of touts itself as the center of innovation in this country\nYet there that the the predominant of a few major companies there that basically buy up smaller companies and and start up ... culture is now a lot about being bought up by one of the behemoth I mean it always was but it's even more so now the level of competition and Silicon Valley is is is skewed\nUm Facebook owns WhatsApp it owns Instagram it's bought all sorts of other companies that we've never heard of at the different ads trucking companies all sorts of things\nUm that they they have a tremendous market dominance um and I that's far I'm not sure that there's a there's a competitor insight\nJames
