station Houston Public media news eighty eight seven ... Houston and K. U. H. T. T. V. eight point six years of service of the University of Houston it's two oh one\nLife from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi saying the Washington Post published another piece by dissident Saudi journalist your mouth ... it is is the paper puts it ... the last piece at a deeper level a difficult shift for colleagues who suspect that don't know for sure that can show that\nHe was last seen alive walking into the Saudi conflict ... that was weeks ago his family and friends believe Saudi hit men loyal to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman were involved\nWashington Post editorial page editor Fred Hi at talk to NPR's Mary Louise Kelly about what it was like publishing could show she's final out that\nWe held onto this call him that he filed the day before he entered the consulate [noise] uh in the hopes that\nWe could edited with him as we normally did and [noise] um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today [noise] has kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world that we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him\nThat spread highest speaking to NPR's Mary Louise Kelly one of our hosts on all things considered well unlike other governments that tremendous ration is not saying if it believes it's a longstanding ally in the middle east was involved\nThe treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin will not be attending next week Saudi investments sound that NPR's John Ydstie has more on that\nMission and that's the decision in a tweet after a meeting with President Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo multiple CEOs for us and global companies have also said the I'll skip the meeting\nA forum intended to highlight opportunities for investment in Saudi Arabia it's part of crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon's effort to diversify his country's economy\nAnd ease its dependence on oil after meeting with Trump Pompeo said he understands the serious nature of the situation he vowed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation\nAfter which he said the U.S would decide how or if to respond\nJohn Ydstie NPR News Washington\nCongressional Democrats say they have documents suggesting President Trump personally changed the government decision to enhance his own financial bottom line NPR's Peter Overby says the FBI was moved out of no building near Trump's D.C hotel\nSaudi Arabia still counts for less than one percent of United States international trade through this summer and when you look at arm's you see that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports\nI think the president and the secretary of state the kind of want to secure this great relationship and that Trump went to Riyadh he posted the Saudi prince here and you have these enormous sales and that stuff that he could sell to defense contractors in a in a midterm election year in reality the numbers are far smaller on an annual was basis\nOne other thing I Want to ask you about is the tech industry um we we were hearing that Hoover\nHas a big investment from Saudi Arabia we remember that when you on mosque famously said he was going to take a Tesla a public at four hundred and twenty dollars a share part of that was about having a big investment from Saudi Arabia there are a lot of big tech games they get a lot of money from Saturday\nThat's right I mean they're an enormous venture investor and the sovereign wealth fun just under stand oil is so hugely profitable for them and they've been looking to diversify for decades especially under this prints\nBut the thing to remember is that these are fungible investors for example there are people that would line up to take that steak off of his hands and Hoover or Tesla they're Korean investors are Japanese investors there are people here in the United states so while it sounds big and the president in the state secretary and even Pat Robertson are trying to make it sound big\nIt's certainly replaceable by other players and the global economy Saudi Arabia is big but not all that big\nWhat would it mean for Saudi Arabia and as you say they've been trying to diversify their economy if they weren't able to uh have these investments in the United states\nI think it's a project for him I mean look where he came to the United states any met with these tech investors he met with Mike Bloomberg it's an image that they very much wanted to project that were coming out of the desert and we're\nVery much espousing the century where you know look at Singapore look it Norway how they've turned their flush domestic coffers into investments and things that are more tangible that's something that he was really trying to sell\nTrump was really trying to sell these guys as an indispensable trading partner an ally in the middle east and that's hugely jeopardized by all you're seeing in the news right now\nA turban fires that hosts the podcast full disclosure Robin thank you\nThank you well the midterm elections are less than three weeks away fill a closer look now at the Senate race in Tennessee where the most recent polling shows Marsha Blackburn a Republican candidate increasing her lead over the Democrat he'll Bredesen developments ... cheating to fall out of the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's\n... confirmation ... is a political reporter at National Public radio I Can't hear Robin heal\nThese names are familiar neither candidate a stranger to politics medicine was mayor of Nashville governor of Tennessee Blackburn at Congress man since two thousand three and a park and the fact that she does prefer the word Congress men and remind us about Marsha Blackburn\nWell Marsha Blackburn has been a staunch supporter of President Trump she's made sure that the make America great again agenda is implemented in Congress and so she's very famous in Nashville in Tennessee\nYeah and we know she's a side of the right ah in two thousand four she invited the known Confederate secessionist revving David O Jones to deliver the opening prayer for the house of representatives and this is the man who at the time was heading up the league of the south they played a big role in organizing the Charlotte protests does she still\nMaintain links to those kinds of you know some people I Would call hate groups\nShe said she doesn't and and of course that's the same rhetoric that we hear from other politicians as well that sometimes they are invited to these events where people like the ones you mentioned artist wants to organize them and then they tried to backtrack and say well they just invited me um it doesn't necessarily mean that they support them\nWell there's that um but let's listen to one of her ads it's a montage of supporters\nI voted Phil Bredesen for governor\nI supported him but I cannot fight that brought us some poses building the wall he supports Obamacare\nThat's a nonstarter from a friend gave crooked Hillary tons of money\nAnd now Washington Democrats raw\nI Can't support ... percent [noise]\nNot just on my show and they had their from Marsha Blackburn\nCampaign looking like it really wants to last a feel better than to\nThe Democratic party and we also heard Blackburn support is referencing the fact that voters didn't at one point and vote for better than who may not now so we talked about what his track record is I'm I'm really not any of this even matters his track record given the combustible politics of today\nIt does matter governor Brett is and she is very ... everyone knows him in the state and he has always wanted to play this moderate guy right he wants to make sure he reaches across the aisle when he was a governor she worked with the Republicans he worked with Democrats\nAnd he always talks about that governor medicine has also been trying to avoid democratic endorsements which is very interesting so for example\nHe said that if he were to be elected to the U.S Senate he would not be supporting democratic leadership so he will not be supporting a Chuck Schumer\nAnd he's been talking about that he's been talking about how the Democratic party needs a new leadership so he's trying to appeal to the moderates appeal to Republicans who might be on the fence but also uh be appealing to the Democrats\nThe Democrats on the left who have been making a showing at the polls in recent elections so let's listen to one as a governor ... ads and these are his supporters\nI'm a lifelong Republican Dana Republican I'm a Republican but I'm supportive of rice and because he can work across the aisle and work both parties have\nMore when Democrats and they were with Republicans sometimes that means he doesn't make everybody in his party happy fill us in the Scully responsible for Republicans to bring both black and seeing how two hundred thousand jobs while he was going to get things done they'll certainly different than the cloud in Washington\nSo there you have an ad from governor Paterson's campaign he is the Democrat but obviously just as you said the ... he's trying to get those moderate Republicans who may be feeling that Marsha Blackburn too far to the right\nThat's right and he doesn't make everyone happy like the ad says for example he recently came out things you would have voted for justice Kavanaugh something that goes against the majority of the Democrats who were\nUm rallying against the justice so he is trying again to show that he is a motor that he is willing to listen to both sides and then make a decision on behalf of Tennessee and that's what he's been saying\nDuring the whole campaign but that's something that a black run campaign and specifically Marsha Blackburn has you know used as part of of that you know attack\nAnd one of the debates up Blackburn said that she had the chance to run a Democrat he had the chance to run as a Republican or an independent but he chose to run as a Democrat so he is part of the establishment that's what a Marsha Blackburn has tried to say during this whole campaign\nIn and trying to get the moderate Republicans away from Marsha Blackburn and doing things like can being in favor of confirming that cannot to the Supreme Court does he run the danger of putting off people who have been loyal Democrats for years\nIt it definitely affects him and he's running with this thing that he has any of the past ... some of his volunteers are even leaving his campaign ... they can stand why he supported Brett Kavanaugh and so that's something that it's it gets going against him and he needs to figure it out before the election\nYou know ... ... political reporter at National Public radio as you\nTake a look at the Senate race there in Tennessee [noise] you know at least the Senate tracker here I think so much\nLet's hear now [noise]\nHi I'm Ari Shapiro from NPR News trustworthy journalism is not just based on fact it's based on rigorous cross checking of those fact

common one that we see in\nGrocery stores is that on Jew our hands you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green line which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are some white if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a\nTougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like\nA pair and meeting with a water chestnut ... it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicy nests and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common variety very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have one of ... we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I\nAm going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did reading I peeled ... but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it have you with me is naked naked ... I took a cup of sugar ... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them\nI could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm\nI place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup and I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the parent releases its juice into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can do that for breakfast\nAnd you could eat that as part of a salad but you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing my right now but the other thing about parents is that they swing both ways they're savory\nAnd they're also clearly sweet [laughter] so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal\nPear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a Bartlett pair my peel debt I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it and little wedges\nAnd then I have fresh spinach and fall greens and I put my roasted pear around it and I took some French bread or bad get toasted in thin slices and spread blue cheese on top\nAnd I ... in a little bit of maple syrup so you have crunchy green tart\nPungent from the blue cheese and sweet and voluptuous from the ... oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in Vienna grad okay we had this what is this this is ...\nDown ... that you probably heard of upside down pineapple cake and it's very similar I used to variety I used comments I use a um for a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from ... flavor and then I also used a ... pair\nSo I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook and then I laid the parents down in that\nAnd I made a very simple cake batter using all these spaces that just remind you of fall cinnamon all spiced ginger and cardamom and you make this cake batter you put it on top of the pairs and you bake it\nYou take it out of the oven and your house smells like\nPair an apple picking on an gorgeous autumn day you know it's happening and after about ten minutes when it's cold you flip the scale it upside down\nAnd you have this beautiful upside down cake just another way keeping pass the dream no yes rarely do you find a perfectly right pair and store it they're harvested when they're mature but not yet right\nBecause once the terror right than sit only keeps for a few days so you want to ripen it out of the fridge and as soon as it starts to get solved and fragrant put it in the fridge if you're not going to eat it right away and the way that you tell if it's\nRight is that the skin often brightens in color it will become greener or you'll see this blush of red and you push on the neck which is the along gated part on top of the fruits and the yield it's right\nAnd we're not talking much like your some falls into it that's over right so again don't refrigerate on right pairs but do refrigerate them after they've right than to room temperature\nHere in ...
