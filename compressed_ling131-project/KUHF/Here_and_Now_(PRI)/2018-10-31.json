Republican congressional committee\nCame out and attacked him even though that's a very important race for the majority of the of the house yet last night at a debate Senator Joe Donnelly in Indiana came out with comments that could only be seen and perceived as extremely racist yet I have none anybody on the Denver to\nLet let me let me let me didn't come in there for a second because I've been reading the story about Joe Donnelly last night and and what he said is our state directors Indian American but he does an amazing job our director of all constituent services she's African American

to ask you about that at the same time in the context of everything that President Trump is ed calling people animals or you know ... making comments that are that are in in my view I mean I don't know about what do you think\nIt's a I think senator Donnelly was little tone deaf with his language and he should be admonished for that at the same time the point of his statement was to give credit an honor to the people who are who he was working with the point of Donald Trump's statements when he talks about the the caravan coming up from the south and sending five thousand troops\nTo the border for something that's not even a crisis\nUh to to do that the point is just a fear in the American public and frankly to stoke racial animus and that is the thing that we cannot ignore so I don't get I don't say Donald Trump is responsible for the attack of a synagogue or for the pipe bombs\nBut now he knows what will occur in ... when he when he sets the tone that he sets everything he has done since then will be his responsibility because he knows what can happen with the words and we just wanna make\nSure that we've noted we mentioned we're going to look at a Senate race and there

brand you may notice getting a bit more expensive\nAnd that news has some analysts worrying about inflation for the first time in years\nLet's bring in Mike Reagan senior editor for Bloomberg News had Mike Hi Robyn so we've been bracing for higher prices because of the terrorists going into effect but we also have this robust economy can you first explain why raising prices often come hand in hand with an economy that gets too hot\n[noise] well it a lot of it goes to wages are as wage pressure picks up um that increases companies costs and to some degree they pass what they can on to consumers\nAnd one of the spots where it's really strong lately is in a transportation and freight uh there's more or less a shortage of truckers in this country in part because\nOf the strong labor market there's better opportunities or elsewhere and also there's you know new regulations that cut down on the amount of hours truckers can actually tried so that's a big part of it um that said it ... certainly are a big part is especially some of the examples you've cited a\nFor rising prices Coca Cola cited the cost of aluminum I'm a Home Depot was passing on a twenty percent increase in the price of washing machines to consumers and there's plenty of examples like that a to point to terrorists as well\nWell and they have some companies thinking about relocating Steve madness issue company said they might try to move operations out of China to avoid paying the duties so what what could we see an exodus of factories maybe going to Mexico which the whole hope was to bring them here red\nRed I don't know about a mass exodus a at Rosenfeld the CEO Steve Madden said something else he said we can't just flip a switch and move everything out of China and I think that's indicative of what it executives across the country are doing right now trying to determine\nIf these tariffs are a permanent thing or if maybe there is something that goes away with the new Congress or there's push back against President Trump\nSo um they are looking at a option to other countries Steve Martin mentioned in addition to Mexico Brazil Italy Vietnam Portugal India and maybe even Cambodia\nSo it's certainly ... or something CEOs are looking at but it's it's a big deal to move your production out of a country country so ah I wouldn't expect it to happen overnight well\nBig airlines like delta and Jet Blue in American are raising prices they say fuel costs are up forty percent so what are we talking about here\nWell the big airlines um there are going to face some pressure in actually passing on those fuel costs to consumers because airlines have had added a lot of capacity over recent years so it's a very competitive market\nSo the damage there will likely be more to airlines own profits rather than passing on a a hundred percent of the fuel costs on the consumers\nYeah but like I just to make sure he's underscored what we begin speaking about are you saying that American consumers are paying really as these prices go up for the terrorists that were led a to punish other countries [noise]\nYes in many cases they are you know not a surprise

you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are ... just because one state the ... does not have both the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but\nIn terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance in the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day":
