come back to the fed and what you said about the fed says this is I'm a an entity that has two mandates they are supposed to keep unemployment low and they're supposed to or do what they can to keep unemployment low and to keep inflation in check\n'em when they announced their latest rate hike it was met with the yarn so why would people suddenly be surprised about the fed raising rates have been talking about this for years\nWe did hit that trip wire level of about three and a quarter percent and then you look at the noise emanating from the White House I mean this was Donald Trump's appointee Powell to run the fed\nEven though I mean it's a time honored tradition that kind of a you know shake your fist at the fed when it's tightening into a boy and economy if you're Donald Trump you want to own that economy\nAnd higher borrowing costs are universally unpopular from homeowners um companies the midterms are weeks away and of course if you're a Trump you're going to shake your fist at higher rates\nAnd I was listening to a financial journalist speaking yesterday I asked about ah what is what President Trump had been saying he called what the fed was doing loco a ... and this person said don't pay attention to what he's saying everybody you know every president has the right to get mad at the fed but it's not going to influence what they do\nKnow the fed is like you said I mean there is that the mandate you worried about full employment and modest price increases inflation when and if the markets start believing that the feds finally going to take its foot off the brakes you're going to see rallies across the planet I predict but it's worth remembering that interest rate\nWhile lately they've been higher there still historically low and we're coming off of a period of unprecedented stimulus the fed was far higher than when did you know where it is now before the financial crisis I think we were around five and a quarter percent\nHoward global markets reacting to what's going on\nThere just disproportionate worry in emerging markets you look at China you look at political volatility in Brazil um how are these economy is going to keep attracting critical dollars euros if the Federal Reserve keeps ratcheting up us interest rates I mean\nThat is the thing to own that the purely US treasury if the government is is offering you if the central
