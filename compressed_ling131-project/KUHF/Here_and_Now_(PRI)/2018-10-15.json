seems to be the most obvious the FBI and the Justice Department\nHave clear rules that you're not supposed to make anything that could influence an election I think Ninety Days before an election might even be forty five days but before the election you're not supposed to come out the rules are very sick\nI'm One of the things that's critical about remembering why there is a bipartisan um discomfort with James call me is that he directly violated that rule back in twenty sixteen by\nComing out with a politically important\nNotice days before the election that he was reopening the trial of or she may the ... the um investigation for Hillary Clinton um so I think there's no way I Would bet my last dollar that Mueller's team would not reveal something or indict someone between now and\nThe day\nIt is here\nAll right ah let's go next on the phone to\nUm hadn't like taking my call my question is is I live in California and the early ... and at that time is when governor Gray Davis was recall so they didn't paycheck that had a recall and they voted to recall him and he was put out of office and Schwarzenegger and\nI'm Wondering if you know anything about what went on then and also it anything like that happen or on the national scale of the United states\nFor that to having a national scale read first need to rewrite the constitution there simply is no mechanism in the constitution that we have now for having any kind of\nDo over vote if you will um there's a mechanism of impeachment which means we're moving a guilty president or excuse me between conviction removing you'll be president um and then it's very clear it's next guy up just like in football\nI'm Mike Pence will become part of the United states and they would have to find a new vice presidents in case something happened to him um there's no way to the public if you will can remove a president of their own volition with their own will with their votes until the next election [noise]\nUm you say absence of virtue in our president is the best sign we might have that the founders would want at president impeached um what do you mean my absence search it all\nThe reason they went back to George Washington is that they all could trust at the end of the day that no matter what he did no matter what decision he made even if it was when they disagreed with the new they he had the best interest of the country at heart and when they see the country I mean the entire country all Americans not just people of his own political persuasion\nUm the founders believed much in many ways like a a sovereign king that the president's responsibility was to take care of the nation as a whole\nTherefore if they found the presidents who they thought was thinking about other things in the nation as a whole or they weren't sure that he was thinking about uh the nation as a whole first and foremost a he was pressed concern with his political party are wrestling with themselves rats concerned with his own bank account or with his own ability to stay out of jail\nThat if you start making decisions for himself or herself instead of for the nation\nThat's the absence of virtue that would really upset off morning bills for them\n[noise] um it's also pretty good that you don't think that in any case no matter what the circumstances that any if it's meant and rent subsequent ... and conviction and so that's about ... removal from office will unify the country at least it never has so far\nNo it's it's been quite the opposite I think we're living in hyper partisan times today and historically whenever we have an impeachment trial it divides people for the very reason I mean let's stop and think what impeachment really is impeachment is no love flying popular will the will of the people\nOur country is based upon the will of the people that we elect our leaders to make decisions on her behalf or republic but we do that through popular sovereignty\nIf you then impeaching convict someone you are saying to the voters what you decided at the polls\nNo longer is valid now maybe no longer valid for a very good reason but that is the threshold that we're going to cross so anyone who voted for Donald Trump if he is impeached and convicted you're basically saying to him\nMan did you make a mistake and Americans don't like to be told that um they'd rather have a do over if you on the next election rather than be told that they have to forfeit if you will\nVery briefly was it a mistake for Gerald forward to pardon Richard Nixon\n[noise] it was exactly a mistake for Gerald Ford I actually think in retrospect you know this was many years later it was exactly a good thing for the nation because of exactly what you said the nation was divided the nation was torn up\nAnd he thought especially in the middle of an inflation crisis in the middle of post Vietnam and the middle of the energy crises that nation didn't need the divisiveness of a trial and he thought he would put the nation if you will virtue Wesley above his own political future\nAnd he paid the price for definitely Jeffrey a angle is founding director of the center for presidential history at

CBS News and host of Jill on money her podcast is better off I Jill hello so Sears Holdings Corp which also owns Kmart\nOr is probably going to be giving out a lot of pink slips over the coming months how many employees or risk of losing losing their jobs\nOr somewhere in the neighborhood and nearly Seventy thousand and and it is unclear of what's going to happen remember this is a time when brick and mortar positions for retailers are dwindling\nA an on line ... looking at you Amazon they're going on somewhat of a hiring spree so maybe these folks would go towards the online departments that were in many of the other retailers that they certainly are paying more up to Fifteen bucks an hour\nBut not all of the Sears stores are going to close\nYeah actually I'm the company had nearly nine hundred stores as of August fourth that that's what we pulled from a recent public filing but as you said at the top and its bankruptcy it said it's going to close a hundred and forty two more stores by the end of the year that's after already announcing around forty six store closures\nAnd it's frankly not clear which locations are going to be closed at this point\nSo a lot of bad news for a lot of people is there anybody who wins from what's going on I don't know I mean I hate to say there are winners and there are people that are probably going to make money on this\nHorse because they are going to they have bought distress dad or they are the financial engineers on who the\nManagement had really relied to come ... come around and rescue them but I think that that really Ah yes they were going to be investors you make some money there will be some vulture she can buy liquidated assets at at very pennies on the dollar potentially\nBut frankly there are far more losers than winners and then more so than the people who work there and the people who shot there do you see a path\nForward for Sears will it ever come back\nYou know I recently I guess I Would look and say that retailers have just not had a great track record of emerging from bankruptcy look at Toys R us for example it was forced to liquidate look it's hard to make changes like investing in e commerce or stores or even a company's brand while you're catering to your creditors demands and also more importantly\nWhile you are really trying to face this massive competition\n[noise] we think of so many things when we think of Sears those catalogs are I guess there were also pre cut kit houses which in North Carolina still make up the majority of some towns what Sears going to be remembered for at least the Sears that we know now maybe there will be a Sears and the future that is known for something else\nYou know I I actually think not only the catalog but all those different ancillary brands
