President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents source centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party and the germs and\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here to tell an ounce and it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so old nice to have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cuts\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as\nA as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow um and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that what Joe uh enjoy the ...\nOn the market thing was I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes uh and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor as when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really ... and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the market sorry the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and these are dramatic falls like a thousand points that I mean you're ugly snuff and of course Trump used a tweet that if that happened to president should be fired ... bomb administrator is a ...\nThere's a river everything when you get the last word he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and ... basically saying everything's fine or going to the bruising ridge everybody stay calm\nYeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think for the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat\nSo there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data and the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact he what the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubbly jock\nOr an somebody's phone officers who you're goes you been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio ...
