U. T. Austin what voters do here in Spanish language ads can be quite different from what they hear in English\nIn Texas you can see ads for Republican U.S Senate candidate Ted Cruz in English I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message that says he's booming and in Spanish like this ad featuring the standards dad who came to us from Cuba in the late Nineteen fifties\nRomance how about you write about ready to go out to the people around them\nOnce a case that has seen both ads the thirty three year old Oscar night is a computer scientist and bilingual he says the Spanish ed seems to take a different tack with the elder Cruz talking about the opportunities America gave him as a refugee and the American dream\nYeah you can definitely see the complete difference right so there is no talk about here's this policy here is is a position is being taken eighties completely emotional\nTalking at the heartstrings has been the playbook for most political ads in Spanish says Marisa ... she teaches political science at the University of California San Diego\nA lot of the Spanish language ads are really focused on culture on these emotional messages talking about the American dream and my cleaner caring about family values shared values\nShe worries that Spanish only voters will be left in the dark if these ads only play on emotion and talk less about economic growth taxes or health care\nIf you designed Spanish language ads that are meant much more policy continent English language ad then Spanish speaking voters are not getting the same kind of information that monolingual English language for\nAlmost a third of all eligible voters in Texas and California are Hispanic and their numbers are growing in many states across the country many of those households big predominantly Spanish the Democratic party did spend some cash this week to galvanize the Spanish speaking vote but overall is spending on Spanish language ads going through the roof\nYou answer that question is not really\nThat's Armando ... he runs in LA marketing for him and used to help craft TV ads in Spanish for Republican candidates\nHe says we will have a clear picture of exactly how much has been spent on Spanish ads until after the midterms we do know that spending during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign was less than three million dollars down from twenty million ten years before as a list of things eventually they're going to be a tipping point\nWhere a large part of the electorate every single year but we're still political parties still under invested that outrage\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads in English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish that recording one more and just requires another take them really heavy investment the real cost to both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at\nYale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major cost and this is why I think we don't see more candidates and doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person with a Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe said that could be the English only speakers tend to bristle that adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture conflicts as the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish and the community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be the sort of thing that works better when you can target at the individual level like online advertisements\nYou're online behavior which you search for and what you read tells a politician more about what language you prefer than yours if code does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook\nFeed than what's on your TV [noise] in Austin, Texas I'm a dealer for marketplace [noise]\nYou just financial companies in this economy one would imagine that October two thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the hand or Dell right so ... did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well that and you're walking in the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together\nOr as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do to the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more the result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis\nSo are you going to work every day just kind of hanging on for the ride\n[laughter] no it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days as CEO I was a successful in having the stock price there probably are going to see how does that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah [noise] um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you know what I mean you found that your first Spanish surfaces get your own financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was has a pension actuary so I have provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money we're sided and we linked up with Schwab and\nOver a few years we became Schwab is largest client and then Schwab acquired my farm a few years after that\nYou know your boss Charles Schwab who is still the German the board and and uh active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway uh yeah I'm a ... he and ... and you will\n... originated the concept really at scale of discount retailer brokerage and I wonder if you look around and see that everybody's catching up to you\n'cause fees are going down and and all of those things are happening that have to affect\nYour business well I don't think there's any organization that's generating the net new asset flows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so so I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as you say people are catching up to us but more people understanding that\nIt is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we're doing the right thing by our clients and I'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per dollar\nOn every a client asset than anyone else of size so\nDoes your mind when he was released or no you feel that way to generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes
