P. Morgan city group Wells Fargo ... they'll all report earnings\nAnd that could snap investors out of this uh because they will get some hard data to base decisions on and so things can go out especially if companies are doing well and the fundamentals like strong\nWhich companies are and the fundamentals have been drawn right I mean we have to admit that ride jobs are growing the economy is growing so the underlying reality is salt that straight as I've been here ... on the market beat today Thanks thank you\nAll right so we will turn now to three snapshots from the president of the United states three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words\nAnd what the Federal Reserve has been doing with them namely as marketplaces Mariel cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if your accounting and we are and so is the president which gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background [laughter]\nThen this this morning from a call he made to Fox in front\nOf the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute Dutch all this stuff was what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] and if ... despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do away with it\nSo if your business and economics journalist what do you do with that because the president\nIs just wrong the fed is not crazy or ... or stringent the central bank under both its current and the media to pass cheers has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I ask you about back in July if it bugs him when the White House poke them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here that\nI had a great a colleague in mentor back in a day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying\nLet's controller control so we control as long as what we do\nWhat we do and and I just told you what we do when we're always going to do that's who we are it's always who we're going to be we're we're going to we're going to do our business in a way that's strictly non political without taking political issues into consideration\nAnd that you know carries out the mandate Congress has given us a we have the tools to do that we have a statute that allows us to do that in in a way that is independent of political considerations\nI'm strongly committed to it and so on my colleagues\nSo where does all this going well there's a mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets\nTumbling rates rising the fed doing what it's doing the president doing what he's doing it's all anchored all of it in the knock on effects of one economic reality whose name is inflation the fed as we told you would like to see prices rising by about two percent a year we got some new inflation numbers this morning and marketplaces Kimberly Adams has more on what they may or may not me\nThe consumer price index tracks prices for a basket of goods and services and I'll just it was up a tenth of a percent landing at two point three percent year over year\nInflation is at a moderate level it's very close to where actually the Federal Reserve would like to see it\nAnd ... teaches economics at Hamilton College I think that it's an endorsement\nOf their current plan to continue to raise interest rates very gradually\nBut numbers are funny you could use those same CPI numbers to make a different argument economist or need to desk he at every court ISI sums up the counterpoint\nThe fed has a two percent inflation target these numbers are close to two percent why on earth would be be raising rates\nTo desk he says the fed isn't just looking at where inflation is now it's looking at where it's headed plus the fact is it's\nAll that attached to the CPI main piece of data they look out for their inflation target is a different price in later called P.
