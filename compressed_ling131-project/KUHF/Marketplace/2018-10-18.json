Notre Dame says for one thing the U.S trade officials have been a little busy hammering out another deal to replace NAFTA and that involved just three countries\nWould you take the two twenty eight countries in the European Union it's a very demanding procedure demands a lot of time\nAnd Michelle Egan a fellow at the council on Foreign Relations says some of those non tariff barriers like differing regulations and industry standards are hard to resolve\nTheir differences in regulations on cosmetics for example because of animal testing differences in the way cars are tested in terms of safety light for seatbelts\nAnd then there are the politics says Charles caption professor of international affairs at Georgetown he says in Europe growing anti Trump and anti American sentiment could be another roadblock\nAnd on this side of the Atlantic you've gotta protection as president\nWho is none too keen on striking a deal with you because he sees it as a ... vote there has been seeking to

a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nSaid he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in what we're going to ... every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax revenue thanks to the tax cuts passed last year yes\nThe tax cuts that were going to pay for themselves marketplaces Kimberly Adams checks in on how that is going\nSo
