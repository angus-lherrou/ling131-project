{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Discuss amongst ...\nFrom American public me [noise]\nThis is a market for it\nIn Los Angeles on John resolve the twenty sixth of October to always have your long everybody the number\nOf the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew in the summer quarter July through September ... bucks\nBecause you knew there was going to be a bunch of numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be ... Richardson from ... from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City ... ... ...\nLet me start with you uh and and in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a tree she shouldn't Wilson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report\nAs deals with trade but a very quick post on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the month and we're seeing a slow down on so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there is a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts and the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\n... down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking and that is good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice mail\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three ... concerns slower global growth higher interest rates and care if ... concerns\nThose are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay\nKatherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears among leaving them out will will ah [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on this trade and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars in the United states because of all these are not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing\nThen that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with a business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nDo the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget ... his biggest economic problem\nUm even as a German bell told me back in June even knows the fed doesn't bring attention with President says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about ... what does this kind of pressure to suppose due to the motor vehicle\nOr you know it makes it hard job even that much harder rate so what that is really concerned about is how they keep the economic\nBull market running how they keep economic growth and ... ... still normalizing policy because women as and we know that it will be all end eventually the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is is fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero right so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart the his job all the more tricky and that's\nWhat I'm has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a good we're Jones Catherine Rampell the Washington Post on a ... I'm In New Hampshire don't you\nThink ... thanks ...\nWall Street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth on this week I've said this this is normal this is what spoke up and markets go up to go down but it has been a while since things have focus dropping run love the details when we do the numbers\nAnd more of marketplace ahead here on news eighty eight seven thank you for listening today I'm Laurie Johnson Lisa shoe made us with me\nIf you've already given thank you so much\nYou might be considering right now getting a little extra to help news eighty eight seven reach our goal and if you do that extra additional amount that you give will be matched dollar for dollar by our studio society members it's the last friday it's the last match\nIt's the waning moments it's now or never it's do or die this is it\nYour time is now eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or online you give a donation that Houston Public media dot org I don't think you could be any more clear [laughter] thank you for that\nOr the ... of course is our studio society members coming together and\nUh just adding a little extra incentive on the table of course we have great thank you gifts and we have passport\nFor you all joining our family uh bought this match also is about expanding our ranks here in the Houston market of members\nAnd were so grateful and another way to expand the ranks of course is to make sure that the ones we already have don't laps so if that has happened to you you know you're like ... maybe I didn't renew my membership\nIt's now a perfect time because when you do that will also be matched if you call in to increase your gift that will be matched but it's all about\nTaking the action eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media doubt or\nWant to say thank you too Ira from Houston William also from Houston and call and go from Houston thank you all so much each of them getting their contributions matched right now we'd love to send you a thank you gift there's lots to choose from on our website Houston Public media dot org if you give ten dollars a month how about some socks\nTwo pairs of Houston Public media socks black are Geils with the logo subtly repeated and the pattern very fashionable let me tell you\nAnd we will send you two pairs as our thank you gift to you for your one hundred twenty dollar donation ten bucks a month two bucks dip your toe in the water and dip your toe into a sock at ten dollars right now eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org\nAnd ten dollars a month but also get you access to passport and when you you know it's basically are proprietary Netflix for all the PBS shows that you love masterpiece series like seasons one and two of Victoria the first three seasons and poll dark\nFilms from Ken Burns episodes of nova and nature and TBS arts and culture programming you could just go down the rabbit hole on that one for hours and hours\nAnd uh really enjoy the quality entertainment that you would find they're all for taking when you become a member and take advantage of the match eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eighty seven or Houston Public media doubt or\nHow about a ten dollar amounts contribution is thirty three cents a day thirty three cents to wake up to MORNING EDITION to listen to Joshua Johnson and won a\nTo join Craig calling on Houston matters thirty three cents come on folks many people are giving at that level ten dollars a month right now to support Houston Public media if that sounds good to you guess what it will also be matched it becomes\nTwenty bucks a month things Joe studio society members eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven Houston Public media dot org\nWere so grateful for the folks who have already called in and left comments thank you thank you thank you and we haven't heard from all parts of Houston\nHave we heard from you know that's the question in this hour and the final moments of this match the last match on the last day as Lori said we're waiting on you eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
