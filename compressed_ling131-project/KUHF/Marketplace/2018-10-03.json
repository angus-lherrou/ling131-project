P. Morgan Chase security ministers up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a ... spoke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bake history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um\nPeople understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were to\nSome people are saying things that are consuming\nYou know if you've taken a mortgage or have a checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand don't necessarily in the inner workings of a bank doesn't matter\nWhat it does to me but I don't I don't think should matter to the customer now with the customer wants to do good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but it doesn't matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think it I think it matters to understand how business in general works\nSo if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy so defense this was just part of his great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital\nThe formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country the world has it it's not even close is kind of it's kind of a party engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we I guess come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you are sick you're poor and so I I think people says did you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me in their financial crisis\nYou know what's your financial crises that was the guy didn't happen to be seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things it makes me cautious as knowing all that\nI always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything show that were there in good times and bad times and ... more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a second as I said I Want to talk for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer you talk about that a little bit\nI go I I've never believe that the only thing is to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nCompanies wait so sorry how how come everybody thinks all companies just want to maximize your ...\nIt just becomes a narrative it gets repeated over and over companies have to do a very good job over an extended period of time to get customers back ah companies that take care of customers succeed if they rip off customers they don't\nTo me if you don't take care of your employees you don't take care of your customers you will not have financial success okay and so they're they're all related and taking care of your customers and clients they want you to be a good committee citizen\nYou were in favor of the president's tax cuts and it was the regulatory moves I ... I was in favor of the president's business tax cuts\nSo separate business from getting it it is very important if America wants the best economy could possibly have it should have a competitive business tax rate\nThat is a cynical and on the notion that you have a the best to come in the world with a super high tax rate compared you competitors was driving capital and companies and brains overseas that was a mistake\nOn the individual side I Know I didn't ask for personal tax cuts I didn't need one so that was not our drive things have basically it was like we need a competitive taxes them to be competitive and then you know do we have to do in the other side to help pay for all those all all the things that we need to talk to take care of America\nHelped me understand how um\nRegular people see that benefit right what's the benefit to society well there's there's\nThere's several benefits guy but if you have a healthy economy you will have more jobs and more wages and that's all directly related to how we doing that wages so far ...\nYou know not so good but but part of the reason 'cause you have a ... you know and when the health bill in the tax bill first went through company did raise wages they did they get bonuses right that's mostly they developed some bonuses some Catholics better choose something wages\nThe real benefit is to move overtime as capital is retained and re invested in the United states\nCapitol Dr productivity productivity drive growth productivity drives wages it's a cumulative effect overtime the damage which she lives in the past ... see to see it all at once it's just one of the reasons we were two percent growth and not three percent growth\nAnd so that we need to have a competitive taxes ever competitive economy\nDo you think big companies in this kind of make it a bad rap\nSometimes but I'm not sure it's ... I mean if you look around society I always get a bad rap press gets a bad rap politicians get a bad rap lawyers get a bad rap doctors sometimes could have bad rap or we we've become a bad rap country I mean we I Wish we were more positive we used to be\nYou know it's funny there's a there's a picture and when you're sitting rooms out there of the bank at night lit up we'll do really good and then there's a there's a plate underneath with a quote from Jay purple Morgan says the first thing is character you know for money\nAnd property and anything else I sounds like you don't think we're doing so well in that\nNo no I actually think it's a lot of character in the states of America I think we're just tearing each other for for some reasons I don't fully understand but I think I think most people are pretty good character for the first is character when Jay pure Morgan said that it was also referring to is that about the models\nOf credit I always feel kind of is you can have all the models you want but character and culture isn't in a model and we have to make those judgments too like when the most important\nThings we do is who we do business with if I had on from your clients I'm gonna have a crummy back [noise]\nSo that's part want more of Jamie diamond in the second half of the program the financial crisis of course also where this economy stands today\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
