C. A. the White House says the agreement is a quote we in for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ...

welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nOn so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and uh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established the tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you were on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year has that ship friday sale\nThink we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good\nMovement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were imposed the movements slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first house\nHere and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nThose kind of looked like the from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses um\nBoth hops in Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see 'em\nYou know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a it was a pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us and in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah absolutely is labor in our part of the country up here\nA farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us\nIn many other employers in this region or were extensively using the industry just worker visa program to help me or labor needs\nAnd there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right now that would\nMake some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nPatrick Smith from Loftis ranch is good to have you back on the show great thankfully\nIf you have questions about this revised trade relationship between the U.S Canada and Mexico or many trade questions in
