can make rising interest rates in traditional or online bank accounts look good Jennifer Myers is a financial planner at said vast wealth management\nIt has been a problem for younger investors to get over that fear and I am concerned that the fear factor of an upcoming market decline could be exacerbated given the memories of two thousand eight\nMyers says the two percent rate some banks are

right now eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org\nWe're going to do kind of a high concept story on terrorists in the trade war a little bit later in the program but we are going to dig into some of the practicalities of it now the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum and more than two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nAre turning up in the ... of places it turns out including your water there is an American company that sells water purification products to municipal water systems in this country but it's plant is over in China so it's trying real hard to find a way to bypass the latest list of import taxes\nThose marketplaces re beneficial reports finding that tariffs escape hatch it's a little bit difficult right now you're hearing water\nComing from thousands of feet underneath Los Angeles\nOh we get about one forty five million gallons of water out of the road every day\nDavid goals have been the engineer here at locker center valley water district for Twenty one years it provides water for four towns near LA\nCome through into our system here when we were treated for high nitrates so to treat\nThe water for this flu which by the way comes from fertilizer and septic systems they hype it through these Fifteen foot tall beige pressurized vast full of little filter balls made of resin\nWhich cut all like ... um started for both very similar to that wealth pretty much all of this stuff the resin balls the steel pipes it's getting more expensive\nFor one simple reason tariffs twenty five percent tariffs on goods from China for starters including those filter balls at ... percent or they'll need replacing in a couple of years\nAh we anticipate the cost to be twenty five to thirty percent more so we're looking at forty to fifty thousand dollars extra cost\nAnd twenty five percent tariffs on steel and aluminum the pipes are made from steel\nYou've seen actual quotes from our puppies away by the steel pipes saying that they've also increased surprised but twenty five percent\nThese price hikes are getting passed directly to consumers in the form of rate increases under water bills\nSourcing by the two percent increase primarily due to the increase in our materials cost\nThe company that produces the little water purifying resin balls is called pure light itself to municipal water systems around the country that serves millions of consumers\nIt is a U.S company but it owns a factory in China Jacob Brody is vice president he says one way to get around the tariffs would be to make the filter resin here to build a new facility\nIn the United states\nWill cost tens of millions of dollars and take two to three years his factory in China search customers all over the world he says building an additional factory just for the U.S\nDoesn't make economic sense we couldn't afford to shut the factory down in China meanwhile he's applied with us trade representative to be excluded from the tariff attorney Richard Weiner is representing prayer light\nThe problem at all this is there's no timeline for us to you are to decide\nOn our motion for reconsideration\nThe U.S trade representative offices received around five thousand applications to get exemptions from just a small piece of the China tariffs the Commerce Department has received almost thirty six thousand applications for exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs ambassador Miriam superhero is a former deputy us trade representative\nThis is such an unprecedented situation as a small agency us are simply does not have the resources necessary to try and process the current backlog of requests for exemptions\nIn some ways pure light is lucky because at least it can apply for an exemption most companies don't have that option under administration rules attorney Richard Weiner says he has no idea whether he'll get a response was application in weeks or months or years us yard and respond when asked about this\nIn our case it's really rather urgent goal of the top tariffs it is to punish China\nBut here we have a situation where the effect of the tariff is solita harm Americans not Chinese so we're kind of caught in a crossfire\nWith no clear timetable for getting out in New York I'm Rebecca shore for marketplace\nOn Wall street day basically got back everything they lost
