{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "The interview that we opened today show with the interview I recorded this morning about Saturday's massacre at the tree of life synagogue with Washington Post ... who is also the author of the book rising out of hatred it's about white nationalism and one of its former young leaders\nAnti Semitic crimes are on the rise the Anti Defamation league's annual report said that the number of report it anti Semitic incidents in the U.S surge fifty seven percent and twenty Seventeen that's the highest percentage since they started\nTracking anti Semitic crimes in Nineteen Seventy nine\nI'm the president has stirred up a lot of fear about immigrants from Mexico from Guatemala and Honduras and and the so called caravan are immigrants from um Muslim countries he's very concerned about and has stirred up a lot of fear about\nBut we have a home grown hate movement\nIn the United states and the the mass shooting at the synagogue is just the most recent example of it\nHow seriously do you think we need to take this home grown hate movement and do you think that\nThat we as a nation and that our government is taking it seriously enough\nI don't think we're taking it seriously enough that I'm not sure it would be possible to take it seriously enough I think it's potentially the greatest threat that we face I'm just if you look at last week with three major incidents of of\nFar right extremist and terrorism and and our country a I think that that that's a much more real threat than for instance a caravan of of immigrants uh that's thousands of miles away and and and that is hoping to potentially come here and get jobs and\nI let it snow Charlottesville on a mix of course\nYeah of course um the other thing is that among these really have a valid white nationalist groups and\nI didn't really understand when I began reporting this book that uh that white nationalist tend to blame juice for almost everything and you know and and so I think when we see something like the the L report thing that last year was that was one of the the larger the earth for for\nThreats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand and for that and\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because these are the people that\nThat white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from these white supremacist idea\nIs this an unnerving time for you ...\nYeah it's it's usually on every time for me I'm In part because when something\nWhen something like the synagogue shooting happens and\nI feel a haunted and depressed\nBut I don't feel shock um you know in order to feel shocked you have to be surprised and unfortunately these kinds of incidents are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kind of inevitability that is true in terms of mass shootings in general are that this country has not been able to address off and\nBut it's also increasingly true in terms of you know acts of hate or\nYou know I don't think that this will be the last one and and I think probably like a lot of us I sort of\nLive live in fear

I was concerned about what am I I thought it may be cause a problem um and it turns out he was one thing about it\nHe just hated what he saw what are your but we have to work on this one individual at a time and I'm hoping that this uh Robert to this is a horrible thing he's still alive we need to find out what makes people monsters awash thing a full picture of Adolf Hitler we ate\nAnd ate off\nHe became Hitler the monster but we have to be more patient a more detailed or through how do these people get or they are thank you\nAll right thanks very much for the call and for the comment marks any reaction to that\n[noise] well I think he's right um you do have to pay attention to all of this you often have to fight this type of sentiment one person at a time it's very effective I think if you do it that way um so yeah I I agree with him\nJoel we have a tweet from ... who asked should we get rid of anonymity on the Internet do you think that's a factor in all of this\nNo no I don't I don't think so\nThere there may be too many instances people or they're using their names today yes\nYeah ... yeah I think people using the name they're comfortable with it and um [noise]\nI guess also I Would say that ah yeah I I'm I'm assuming an incident like what happened in Pittsburgh it's true I synagogue discussion but\nIs it is an individual who's out on the fringe someplace and uh so there may be known groups anti Semitic groups um but it's the individuals who are um but I think we are so exposed to [noise] um and so many different levels\n[noise] uh you you both her lab because of the important thing for the latter part of her took the ability you're going to go ahead you know\nI I'm Sorry but I disagree with Joel I think that um I don't I'm not\nGoing to say that we should do away with anonymity on the Internet but I think it is a factor\nIn some cases yes people are using their names but I think there are other people who don't use their names to agree with people who use their names and I think this has an enabling effect\nUm sometimes people are afraid to voice these controversial opinions when they use her name's ... voice them and sort of add to the glamour and I think that ... things up so I think there are times when um the anonymity is not useful\nRoberts in southwest Houston Robert what's your question or comment\nOr anything in my call 'em I recently read an article in the way it was saying that people have been found to change their political opinions as to their party rather than the other way around\nAnd um the common trope sort of Trump has been elected was that you know these people are not one bold and open their you know as you know I've always been around and always wary of are now you know so to speak\nBut how much of that is true versus how many people used to be normal so to speak or at least dangerous are now becoming radicalized I mean like the guys\nI mean the pipe bomb Florida all out what's going on with a goal so twenty six fingers actually on the thing that you know like rush\nOkay thanks for the call and for the question do you ...\nThink there's any way to answer that question because I you know we don't have even I don't have a study on that sort of thing or somebody who's quote normal and then um becomes radicalized I I Do I Would say that um\nRadicalization like this has been made easier through the way that information travels so quickly now and people get information from so many different sources so I think it's easier for people to become radicalized but as far as you know how many people have always felt this way and I've been involved in\nA or have suddenly become this way I don't know that there's any way to to to answer that question\nIs it likely that both are at play at least a little bit\nI Would say uh\nUh you heard of a child labor mentioned security ah Joel President Trump on Saturday said if there was an armed guard inside the temple they would have been able to stop him a first of all of course I just want to ask you if you agree with that assessment but also whether you think that's the lesson that should be taken from this\nAh I don't think that's the lesson that should be taken from this at all um you know I take you'll find them in religious institutions community centers YMCAs shopping malls or are there more and more armed security that credit presence\n'em and they're meant to create a statement of presidents not necessarily a they're not gonna be a complete deterrent so I don't I I Do not agree with that statement at all I think um [noise] I I'm not the case\nThat said you have any security concerns and in the wake of this shooting anything be oh ...\nAbsolutely of security concerns on a regular basis or we have security concerns last week when a there with a male bombs taking place and although they were directed at of a you know national figures\nOr there's always uh always a sense of needing to be alert and ... and vigilant regarding the potential for anything copycat [noise]\nUh so we always are on a focusing on security here\nJoel banking CEO of Houston's Evelyn Reuben seemed Jewish community center and you know mark senior

took a step toward establishing a College of medicine after the Texas higher education coordinating board\nUnanimously approved a doctor medicine degree for the institution but there's still several critical steps you're meeting before the college could opened its doors to students in December the university was submitted to application to the federal accredited in body for medical degree programs\nBut U H isn't the only institution in greater Houston looking to establish a medical school Michael haggard easier with more like a big rig of who else is pursuing this same Houston state\nUniversity in Huntsville there are also involved in the application and accreditation process for their proposed College of osteopathic medicine they're breaking ground on a new facility and con row in November and if all goes as planned they want to start classes by the fall of twenty twenty\nThere are other teaching institutions in the Texas Medical center of course in around the region why do we need more medical school well Sam Houston states new\nDino the proposed college Dr Charles ... tells me his school and tends to focus son meeting a very specific need for east Texas\nAccess to good health care as a as a problem for that region\nA our hope is that was with tablets ourselves and we work with those political partners that will be able to change the workforce eventually after we Put Students are out there you go on to a good residences in the area\nWe hope to be able to recruit from those areas so students will be comfortable going back to where they came from the practice\nAnd so actually there's got to take a while but we will eventually sort or re populate that area where the kinds of people that we would hope to see in terms of providing more access to primary care to some specialty care and mental health and those kinds of things\nRecruiting students from that area what else would you may be due to try and ensure that doctors should the graduate maybe stay in the air to serve those communities\nWhat other things that we talk through our political partners about is a and the third and fourth year 'cause that's the the third year is that Korea or there were they really are imbedded and they are in the clinical practice and then the fourth year they have a little bit more choice in terms of rotation so I have more\nFlexibility in terms of a lock those but um [noise]\nOur intention is to have a\nWhen we select students for a particular area we have right now I think eight um regional hospitals that we're going to be having students rotate through\nBut what a student goes to a place like let's say that I can do just or someplace like maybe lockdown our Baptist or you know whatever they will stay there for the fall time they're not gonna just rotate around in different hospitals\nAnd different services they will be committed to that hospital for the the whole time that they're in the third year and most of the fourth year\nAnd so they'll live in that community and I'll get to know the the people in the hospital they'll get to know you know the people in the community the kind of the and printed about\nWhat it's like to practice in that area\nWhen they go on and do a residency they may do it in that location or some place else but hopefully that embedded in memory on that and printing will help them make a decision\nThat that's a good place to practice because they'll know every one of the trouble there\nAnd so the easy for them than come and that have various for practice\nAnd the school's going to focus on osteopathic medicine and that approach a socialistic approach to medicine can you remind us what that means to the lay person and how that's different than other approaches\nPeople use the term holistic kinda loosely uh I'm a family physician and uh most of my career\nOr we've always thought that family physicians a practice holistic medicine you know a whole the whole patient the approach that that could be and these are the what was it didn't matter if you're a family doctor you had that off the path of medicine as a ...\nAnd as a college\nShares that philosophy but they also have a history of uh utilizing an approach to the patient that also includes a looking at\nWhat we call ... says the body's ability to heal itself and that sometimes people will do better if they are able to have a certain kind of a line that ah that you can help them with a\nMath skills skeletal issues that sometimes also help them heal better\nThat it's just it's a process of\nManipulation that it was then developed a sense of the very beginning back in eighty Eighteen eighties uh Eighteen nineties and uh [noise]\nBut it's not ... not everything that we do is we use a lot times that does techniques and diagnostic approach the patience and ah and sometimes in treatment that uh you can graduate from an osteopathic medical school and you can go and do anything you want\nWith neurosurgeons dermatologist psychiatrists everything you're everything and I think uh\nThat that basic or underlying principal a holistic care and a minute the elation is still part of the uh early medical school training\nWhy did the university's leadership decide that was the right approach to serve these rural communities\nI think that the um very early on when they start thinking about having a a medical school\nThey understood that they're a mission was to help reframe the medical community in east Texas that there is a dire need\nAnd so they looked at the opportunities that exist and to help make that happen\nAnd what they found out was that a osteopathic\nA medicine a graduated more people into primary care and rural practice than did the alum path a professional them decide and or even though the idea can go on and do everything they want to do like I just said a large number of them choose to do primary care like I did\nAnd choose to work in a\nRural and underserved communities and I think that's\nThat's part of the training that they get there's less emphasis on sub specialty career development and a little bit more emphasis on primary care\nThis eastern ... talking with Dr Charles ... he's the dean of shame ... universities proposed college an osteopathic medicine and one of the challenges you think are trying to launch a new medical school these days in the current healthcare climate the current education Clement whatever\nYeah I'm all those are interesting questions for a lot of different reasons um I think Texas or the Texas market is a little different and I think you can say that\nPretty much wherever you go you know the Florida market is very much different than ah than Texas in every state has its own um [noise]\nSome variation of what is important and how things work and uh when you come to places like Texas you really have to sort of prove yourself you know you have to make sure that people understand exactly what you're doing and why you're here\nAnd we are a little bit different in terms of being a I'm a community based medical school and so that is it a little different model that we have a we have to make sure that we explain well to people\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial ... don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has the authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke 'em your question about about making a change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff I Know
