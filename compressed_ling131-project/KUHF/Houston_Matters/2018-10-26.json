[noise]\nAnd what was lost in that was the idea that national identity is very important and it's important to you can't have a democracy for instance unless the people within a country all feel that they're part of a we W. E.\nOr that they are willing to give a certain amount of power to people that they've never seen and that they never will see where a let's say I pay taxes\nThat go to somebody who's unemployed in Reno nevada\nOr in Dallas texas\nA ... mile never see in my life but because that person is also part of the same nation I'm willing to do it\nSo in this sense being part of the nation and identifying as aid and American or somebody in France or someone is is a ... an essential part of democracy and the welfare state\nBut it can also go ah manifest itself politically on the left and the the right you can have like Abraham Lincoln I laughed and Theodore Roosevelt but you can also have Hitler Musa ...\nOr you can also have in America George Wallace Donald Trump all of whom were a rabbit national so it can it can manifest itself in different in different forms\nBut what I'm trying to say is that a in an underlying way nationalism busy stream Lee important invalid and should be part of our political outlook\n[noise] so [noise] why does a lot of nationalism these days seemed to only come from the right side of the political spectrum\nWell look what you have to think about is first that any politics people appealed to the national interest uh you can't get a ... a program or a piece of legislation through Congress ... at any time unless you can at least demonstrate that it's in the national\nInterests but at certain times you get this kind of explicit nationalism and that's the kind of thing that we have now\nWhy is it mostly on the on the right eye one way to think about it is to think about what the effect of globalization has been within the United states and Western Europe\nAnd one of the things that happened is that there's been a creation of a kind of group of people which ah [noise]\nAh the British call them the left behind um middle America the people who live in small and midsized town that used to be based in manufacturing and mining who feel that somehow that they no longer have the same kind of future in America\nAnd indeed they don't they can't look towards a lifetime employment in the same company the way that people used to\nMake the switch to being a

area researchers\nSay a government program to purchase storm damaged and flood prone homes in greater Houston could be accelerating historic trends of white flight from the city's core to the suburbs\nThe news eighty eight seven Travis ... reported Tuesday a new study of more than three thousand home buyouts in Harris County before Hurricane Harvey finds most of the biology place in neighborhoods where the history of white flight white homeowners leaving for suburban areas\nThe study from Rice University's Baker Institute for urban research finds the biggest predictor of buyouts isn't neighborhoods history of changing for mostly white mostly Hispanic between Nineteen Seventy in the year two thousand\nWhile the study did not considered the thousand or so home buyouts added to Harris counties program since Harvey researcher Kevin ... says it definitely suggest to us that the practice of using buyouts in Harris County over the last Twenty years\nHas helped facilitate the sort of out migration from areas that have already seen substantial white flight in prior decades\nBuyouts accelerate historic trends of white flight from the city to the birds\nIs this good bad or ugly Mary started off\nIt's bad and and the study is really suspicious I looked it up on Russia's website where there's more information and they're really asking a question more than making a conclusion they're saying they suggest this and\nThey also say there ought to be a study and they also admit this was my favorite we do not know the racial identity of the people who have accepted buyouts so they're making these jumps and then the same Thirty years from Nineteen Seventy two thousand here in Houston according to the census our population changed\nFrom like maybe fifty five sixty percent\nAnglo non Hispanic White to a much lower percentage of those are much higher percentage of Hispanic so the fact that these buyout areas have fewer Anglos and more Hispanics we're sort of\nTells you that it's in Houston you know I Am concerned about the term white flight and I saw there was an Indiana University professor who did a study that seemed a lot more solid\nSaying that white flight is more racial than economic that people are leaving or because they don't want to live next to people who are like them but in this case in this study you know I Love the city and I love it's diversity of their other non Hispanic whites who want to leave Houston\nFine go [laughter] and I'm happy to see them go maybe they can go to our suburbs in Fort Wayne county which has been called the most ethnically diverse county in America\nYou know I think these buyouts might have been because of flooding and rather than white flight might have been mold flight or water flight or I don't like fish swimming in my living room floor Charles I mean\nIt's ugly agree with Mary and I guess it seems to me that the overall effect on a macro scale is probably pretty small I mean marriage right if you look at\nJust the census patterns and beta over the last thirty or so years I mean three thousand people here and there is kind of a blip\nThat said they'd raised an interesting question and it's something that I agree you know we probably should give more thought too and I mean I'm assuming having not read this myself\nThat the way that this can come about is if the buyouts are voluntary as in you know this is available you come tell us if you want it you know maybe you could rethink that maybe you could change the criteria for allowing it or maybe you can say okay\nThis part of town it's flooded enough times in a short period and we're just buying everybody out and you can take it or leave it\nI don't know I on the one hand there's nothing about that sounds good it still probably a relatively small effect overall and it's not like it would change the nature of using if none of this existed but we could still give some thought to it and maybe consider if there are things we might do differently to mitigate this relatively small effect which is still in effect\nAlright ... I don't know how this keeps happening in a mean but every time you bring me on I've been personally affected by some beef from before because I have seen white flight happen it's bad I went to high school that was mostly white I Believe it was like fifty five percent white\nForty percent Hispanic threats were black and other other communities living there\nAnd then another high school brand new high schools opened\nAnd the population flipped from fifty five percent white to twelve percent white in one ear\nAnd the ramifications of that in the school itself were completely noticeable arts programs died out after school programs completely died out funding or even like most basic equipment died out when people talk about white flight it isn't so much the like oncoming\nOr leaving of a particular race or culture we're talking about money we're talking about people who are impacted by that neighborhood losing out on\nLet's face it what what kind of Asian people take for granted which is the arts and culture and sports arenas and vital services like police officers things that because of the way the system has been set up\nCaucasian people have access to and people's color don't know how to access without sounding demanding without sounding put down like ... why can't you take care of yourself and it's a very it puts us in a very strange position because we're either a\nGonna lose out on low income housing or affordable housing because of incoming white flight or the opposite we're going to lose out on stability and her neighborhood because all the funding that was there\nIs no longer there to keep in mind that the majority of people of color were living in these neighborhoods have only been able to own homes and have a tradition of passing their homes and property down from one generation to the other for maybe one or two generations at most\nMeanwhile Caucasian families have been here since the since Houston was settled\nSo for us it isn't just the loss of a neighborhood or a house it's the potential loss of whatever savings\nAnd whatever legacy we can leads to our children so I I think there's a big fear\nYeah Jim cheapest important with all that that are right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at a terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear type can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million books on one tape among car crash\nOkay now there's a corporate story you're right there's it's Sony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody know uses and we'll be using for awhile and there's sort of at loggerheads years going what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patterns in Latin it inventions and the other one says no you're using my patent it inventions and each one has filed complaints that the international Trade Commission and here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the D.C saying please don't shed either of them out\nOr we want to have multiple suppliers um both of them by the way or in Japan and so there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's other Saddam me that shuts down operations\nJimmy the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent it seems on backing up basically the entire Internet on on\nJust two companies [noise] true that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they developed the standard to put ever more stuff on these tapes so if only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow [noise] she's ... she's the ... a correspondent at the Bloomberg soon because a lot of pressure to\n\nYou're listening to news eighty eight seven I'm Laurie Johnson with Lisa she made this is it this it this is the moment it's the moment you've been waiting for the moment we're about to shut up [laughter] stop talking and we only like Lori [laughter]\nBut it's not too late it is not too late for you to give it is not too late for you to have your donation doubled and matched\nBy the studio society the number to call eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven what is the studio society\nYou may say well those are folks that\nGive it a level of a hundred dollars a month or twelve hundred dollars a year and they said we're going to match this so what ever gift amount is right for you if you're a new member you might want to start off at ten twenty thirty dollars a month you might want to make a one time gift\nWhatever works they're going to match it and we're so grateful for every one who have called in we know we still have a few people on the line but it's not complete it's never going to be complete until we hear from you eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven to Houston Public media data work want to say thank you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Houston Matters", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
