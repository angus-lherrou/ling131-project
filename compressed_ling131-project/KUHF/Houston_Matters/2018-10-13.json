World Service this evening eight pm on\nNews is usually doesn't matter so I'm ... Cohen when NASA's Nick Kagan rushing cosmonauts Alexei of chicken and had to make an emergency landing yesterday shortly after launch aboard their Soyuz rocket it reminded us that even the seemingly routine travel to and from the international space station is really anything but\nThe same could be said for life on board the I assess as astronaut Scott Kelly learned in twenty Fifteen and sixteen\nKelly spent nearly a full year aboard the international space station as part of an experiment studying the long term effects on the human body of living in zero gravity\nKelly has a new book of photographs out it's a collection of images he gathered during his you're in space it's called infinite wonder last fall or own Joshua was in spoke with Kelly about his year in space and readjusting to life back on earth which is Kelly described in his memoir called endurance was a pretty unpleasant experience when he first landed\nYou know the symptomatic stuff the stuff you you feel or she is a pretty much cleared up so I kind of feel like I did before launched certainly there's the stuff you can't she affects of long term space flight and I'm you know hopefully it'll it'll never become an issue you mentioned in the ...\nSpace which I mean most people don't have any idea what that's like ... what is the smell of space that is what we call it right I think it's not\nThe smell of nothing is really the smell of the the hardware the\nAluminum and steel the materials that are exposed to ah the space environment whether it's because of micro gravity and off gassing or you know exposures to the harsh rays of the sun there's certain it creates a certain smell\nAnd I probably need to look into this some more and do a little bit more research because people were really interested in it but\nTo me it smells like a welding like a welding smell or maybe spark colors on the fourth of July other people describe it as more like a sweet smell like they think it could be like something you might eat that kind of sweetness but to me it smells more like burn metal\nSo while you're up there you were doing a lot of experimenting there were there were multiple experiments that you were doing and some of the other crew members were doing you talk in the book about how\nYou had to do a lot of different experiments for a lot of different disciplines um some that maybe you weren't innately interested in but they you know it was part of your job or what were there any experiments that you were really into when you were doing them you were really fascinated by by operating on them\nWe had a bunch of ah rodents on board that we did some a science or with we were happy that they could donate themselves to to science our future\nThat was very exacting work it was interesting to me it was hard which I think made it more interesting we had flowers that I grew up in the space station as a pre core cursor to you know growing more complicated stuff or some day going to Mars for nutritional purposes\nThat was interesting the public really connected with that so that was fun um but there's over four hundred different scientific experiments that went on and on the space station per year some of those I was intimately familiar with the medical stuff so that was done on me should me the twin study with my\nBetween me and my brother mark and others that you have no involvement with but that doesn't mean earning less important it's just their automated\nFlood control district promises the public will be engaged in intervals throughout the study ... three years six million dollar study to id improvements to addicts and Barker is this good better ugly Fred start us off\nWell I think it's good that they're doing something about this problem that has existed for a while\nBut it's bad that there had been so many studies and so much money spent on doing these studies and it just because a lot of confusion with so many people and it it just seems as if\nWe do studies but there's not a lot of action happens when we do these studies and that's very frustrating to citizens especially the people who are flooded I think there needs to be a lot more action going on in any good to understand what the problem is and come up with solutions but this this study is\nOnly for the study it doesn't include the construction the implementation the maintenance and when looked on the corps a website to look at their budget\nAnd they actually have it think ten more floods studies going on in different parts of the country so there's a lot of studying going on and on about what's going on with floods\nBut I don't see a whole lot of actual action that's occurring and that's I I'm pretty sure that's what people when used them what to say they want to see some action they want to see a real flood mitigation plan they want to see something that's being done to make this\nArea and this reads a lot more a resistance to these devastating floods that have been occurring over the last few years and and that's what I'd really like to see a sure we study it but let's transfer all in the study and to some actual action at least ...\nYeah no I agree with that and this is all very confused and we hear about a steady and then nothing happens and I think we started to equate the word steady within action and stalling and bureaucracy but I think this is a good thing I was I was confused myself and I was talking to the county judges office and\nI think it's important to point out this is a federal as steady this is there any court engineer and this needs to happen\nIf we want a third reservoir there have been studies that acts and Barker we know that those are problematic\nAnd need repair their things and have you done this is not that study being done over again this is a new study that really gets the lay of the land and how everything works together how the bias connected and supposedly\nReally assesses what is needed in terms of the third reservoir and other projects and maybe that says the cost and you know I think that this is actually a pretty hopeful thing I trust when they say that there's going to be transparent said because we saw the way the county\nWas able to involve voters that the town halls and have them come and look at maps and give input that actually so they say the input of of you know the average people who showed up\nWas actually put in to the plans that will be billed as a result of a Harris County voters passing overwhelmingly passing the flood blind to that federal agencies that would be in charge of building some of these projects and we've got the accountability promise by the partner of Harris County and its control district's I think is a very helpful thing\nGetting that feedback from the people who were affected were may be affected is so important and if they do that incorrectly that could just mess up the ... because we are being of what we know trust\nBecause there's a reason why there is interest now you're right Fred there's been too much to talk of action finally Harvey happen it shouldn't have taken Harvey to make than something but\nHarvey has happened and I really think that the priorities of some of the leadership of the county yes federal state not quite sure about the state will see in the legislature but I think that some of the party certainly at the county level and the federal level of changed they've open their eyes and this is a a good sign\nMarker Robert well you know I mean I I Can't really disagree with anything specific about ... say here I mean it's hard to complain about research considering the problem that we're having here in Houston not just a party but also the multiple floods that we've been having almost every single year I think bill king recently said that we seem to be having a five hundred year flood every five years\nI guess I share some of those concerns maybe different ways that I'm hearing here because one of the things I couldn't quite grasp of this house is going to connect with the two and a half million dollar one program that will you already\nPassed or not clear on is this really going to take all these new count because obviously the reservoirs have to deal with all of the things that are going on\nNot just the reservoirs by themselves if you're not really looking at what are the other things that the city is going to be doing and what a developers doing that's another ... enforcement or the lack of enforcement among developers when they are\nCovering the floodplain and not re mitigating supposed to all those things\nYou can do a study but if nobody addresses those issues and it just continues on and we see a lot of stories about really developers not taking into account regardless of what our city coach says some kind of guarded in that hopefulness that hopefully the solution to something\nJust as my own little side note on this I Know people make a big deal about it's federally funded wolf guys you know like at some other entity we're still paying for it so you know I think that it's good that we're getting some of the funds back that we're putting into a pot\nBut just remember that part of something that other people are digging too as well but overall I think it's a good thing\nWell the difference between taking it out of your copycat and taking it out of the Mississippi and now I Would you rather as well you yeah but\nBut but you know we're putting into the Mississippi in a bunch of other people to pull the U.S it'd be so it it kinda hides that accountability I so that's the point that\nPanel Harris County is poised to follow the city of Houston we buy affective Lee banning so called robot Brussels\nHarris County already bans live sex acts that any place of business Robert sword first assistant county attorney says that in his reading that includes sex with anthropomorphic devices\nBut he believes it might be a good idea to amend the current sexually oriented business regulations the office of the Harris County attorney has been working with the county sheriff's office on such an amendment assistant chief Tim ... expects there'll be ready to present it took ... court within two weeks\nCounties effort is almost identical to the city of Houston's\nBoth had been prompted by an announcement last month by a Canadian company called ... dolls that plan to open a love dolls brothel here in the bayou city\nPlease remember this is public radio and a family show a a note again that Harris County is trying to match the city of Houston ban on so called robot Brussels and I ask you is this good bad or ugly who wants it\nAll of us reverting either [laughter]\nWell if you smoked for if you are oh good\nLord I don't know what are we supposed to say it's good that are ugly the actual brothel or the attempt to stop it\nI suppose the attempt to match the city's ban\nYeah it's fine I mean if that's what people want I you know good lord\nI just think it's really bad about all of this is before this conversation I associated the word to anthropomorphize them with something as wholesome as Walt Disney by talking nice guy so now I've got I never knew that there is yeah [laughter]\nI Will say I have seen what's that show a well Jude Law I rather enjoyed him in a a guy and I enjoyed it yeah\nAnd there's this Westworld on that show also that that deals with this this theme\nBut you're talking to a person who probably I Would entertain the idea of legalizing prostitution because I just think that ticked off all the way that women are trafficked and I think that regulation could\nIt's always going to exist into regulation could do some good there in terms of this you know these things they objectify women the way that prostitution does as well and so if we're going to say one is illegal it's consistent to say\nThis thing is it legal as well have to say I'm probably more torn about it then then you would think because\nThere is a market for these things and we have to understand why that is if people are lonely and this isn't\nThe way to deal with it I guess but probably the way to deal with it is to you know get some help turned to friends when you're lonely and just kind of do the do the healthy things that we never good for mental health and not going to a robot brothel I Would not for that in the in the mix savvy and things that enrich mental health\nAh the thing I Do I Want to see people who go to something like this prosecuted not really so it's probably best just not\nTo allow it at all ... you know Greg you need to start picking such dry boring\n[laughter]\nThere's so many ways to touch the subject I Do have mixed feelings about this as well I tried to do some research and I have to admit some of the pictures I saw on the Internet what these these look like and how they act was I'm off putting and creepy I just I just wanted creepy and um my libertarian side wants to cut a lot of people make their own choices\nI I Will just set up front that I missed when I'm not gonna lose sleep over people not being able to do this and just happened to be forced to pick the home of course I did find out that to get one of these is can be ten thousand dollars apiece\nThere's a place called ...\nWhich is a lot of very spicy\nHad no knowledge that for you know no no ... I Want an Arab world [laughter] I suppose or how real is robot [laughter] but ah it wasn't real enough I'm a ... you know through companion\nI thought that anything but that is not a real person there was a video of this for taking out the dough all into the streets of London and uh\nAnd it looked like he just had a cadaver with him I mean to me it just was just a very very strange thing to do some disturbed a little bit about it because you know with all the technology that we're having ... seems to be giving people more options on how not to commit it with people\nWhether it's the fantasy of social media where you think you're connecting with people but in fact studies are showing that it's the opposite you're not really", "show_name": "Houston Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
