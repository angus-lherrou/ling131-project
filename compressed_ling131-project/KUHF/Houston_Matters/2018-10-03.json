put a Nike kind of back in the consciousness of a lot of people um\nSent me a few trips to to blacks which if there was a lot of conversations around me\nCongratulating Nike for taking on this subject really putting calling Kappa Nick front and center I'm you know I remember this is someone who wasn't playing um there was a new times I'm report and saying that at one point Nike was very seriously thinking about cutting ties with which company because she wasn't necessarily getting\nTheir money's without him so\nYou know this has been um something that has been good anecdotally for Nike is

arrested now it's gone back on that\nI'm On that decision thankfully\nBut this whole national anthem patriotism business I mean you know who's moved patriotic than the others so I think this guy and the Nike ad\nIn that sense Bush's boats that it uses the idea that you're pushing the limits of human endurance in in your sport which the fact that I may be as patriotic as you just do it

layoffs or can you remind us what preemptive measures he's already taken\nA halo he's already taken an across the board hiring freeze and that applies not just to the fire department it but the police department and all the other cities departments and and the point that the mirror made again today is that uh if proposition be passes\nHe's arguing that the cost of pay parity would not be borne by the fire department alone it would require them taking money out of the budget every single city department so why bother hiring more people now\nMeanwhile city council approved a new contract with Houston police this morning [laughter] right\nRight and that that would increase the pay for everyone in the department I'm On a by four percent affected the beginning of the next fiscal year another

but regardless\nUh you know a controller brown was testifying in this he said he would actually drive up the cost of pay parity by somewhere in the neighborhood of forty three million dollars over the

effectively means that you are applying the same standards to these kinds of shops that you would to adult movie theaters peep shows\nA strip clubs and so forth you can't have any of these businesses

we dive into those many other developments let's start with what's happening here in the city of Houston today\nWe just heard Andrew Schneider lay out the decisions made by city council this morning to approve a new contract with the Houston police officers union and to approve an item regulating so called robot brothels what's your take on these respective moves today [noise]\nWell I I guess I'll start with the obvious in there the robot sex brothels is that the the ultimate click bait on when people are are going to see that on their um\nLook I think this is one of those issues that are that is is we're getting increasingly see more as sort of technology advances and you're gonna see people trying to do it it speaks to kind of think a larger question we haven't used and we don't have zoning\nWe have very um sort of arcane um regulatory processes in place in order to limit the way businesses can function\nAnd and so part of the time you have to deal with this one of the reasons why this vendor selected Houston is for the very reason that we don't have a the kind of restrictions that Austin Dallas San Antonio and essentially every other major city in the country does so we're probably gonna see more of this\nUm but again a made it it seems like it's not the best use of councils time up two weeks of energy\nDon't know I find is strangely wholesome debating contacts talking about the robots extra compared to everything else in the news this week\nUm that is true you're right about that Ericka it could be more and more into the race\nHow about the Houston police officers union and and that contract\nAt at first I mean\nYeah I mean I think from ... from the details of it I mean increasing salaries for them at a time when when we're dealing with this larger debate about whether or not you should pay parity seems like a I I think a a a bit of a misstep um but but I think that with the whole question about pay parity as a whole doesn't really address the fundamental issue which is\nShould we be paying police and fire the same amount they don't do the same job\nAnd if so um what is the city of you shouldn't go in to look like\nUm when this this passes because I think that if if you look at the polling it indicates that is likely is going to pass this this increase of seven percent is essentially a as as control brown has said is going to increase the bill that is going to come do so just moving forward it didn't it didn't seem like it was the appropriate time\nI I agree it kinda money's the water is at a time when it's not helpful to have the water is not even as Jay says that with paper already there are a number of major cities that have a pre pay parity police and firefighters but I have yet to see\nThe firefighters themselves and for advancement a discussion of why it makes sense for the rate at which police are paid to be the appropriate rate for which they are paid um perhaps it is but I just don't know I haven't even heard that argument for them um and also you know it costs me that but in for about these unions all three of these unions\nAnd you have paid already that would effectively constrain the ability to any of the ... to negotiate independently with the city which seems to be a thing they enjoy doing so I'm not sure laundry and that really benefits the firefighters to have them that their hands tied that way\nIt does sort of create an environment I Would imagine where it's essentially like they're all one you write some degree\nIt does and and I think the other part of it is it it it takes away from the reality that a big part of these union discussion is always the pensions and they have a three separate pensions at about three separate deals um and there's been all always just sort of idea deferred compensation in these public sector unions where\nYou may get less now but you have a more generous pension system and that's certainly been the case with fire\nAll right let's move on to everything else um the FBI's investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as soon as today it must be wrapped up by friday can it legitimately comprehensive investigation be conducted in just a few days time\nI'm not sure that's what they're trying to do it sounds like they haven't interviewed a number of people who could be key witnesses in this context they haven't you know sitting in a number of documents from either side I'm so I'm not sure I Would say that the FBI investigation is merely a fig leaf for Senate Republicans to proceed on the votes for confirmation but it doesn't seem like it's been conducted with\nA ... a commitment to discovering the truth this allegation from Dr Christine forward\nYeah I I think I think the scope of the investigation has been a ... necessarily limited and and so as a consequence I think there's enough time to have done it the question is whether or not it's been done and at the end of the day really what we're talking about is an investigation to convince three or four members of the United States Senate\nUm or whether or not they they feel comfortable voting for him and in some ways you're seeing a shift in the conversation Eric I'd be curious Eric is perspective on this away from the issue of the of the alleged sexual assaults a as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and more towards his temperament I'm as a potential member of the Supreme Court\nI won't get into all the details but uh\nThere's some stuff about the percentage of car components have to be manufactured in the three countries qualify for zero tariffs candidates dairy market is open to us farmers copyright terms extending\nFrom fifty to Seventy years and some other things uh this is expected to be signed by the end of next month with Congress likely to vote on it next year is this a a big win for President Trump\nYeah it really is a big win for for the president I mean I I think you can you can certainly quibble about his tactics\nUm and his rhetoric leading up to ... but the\nThe hard work by the U.S trade negotiators and a department of commerce in building this\nAgreement and and ultimately getting Canada sign on the eleventh hour um is is an unqualified when it's great for Texas a more than any other state we we benefit more ah from bilateral trade with Mexico and an increasingly trade with Canada\nAnd so as a consequence you say it's a positive thing um I I Would just make two things this is not a this is essentially an update of of a twenty year old agreement or NAFTA\nI think the approach that the president and the naming renaming of the agreement from NAFTA to us MCA is not insignificant in large part because he sees is less as a North American regional cooperative agreement and more of two bilateral deals\nThe United states first Mexico second and Canada third in that order what\nDoes it signal for trade policies with other nations\nYou know I thought there was a really interesting comeback I grew up in the wall Street Journal today about this talking about um you know really the deal as an illustration of the limits of production as much as just when you get right down to very unpopular I mean there's been a certain\nEmbrace of the protection is rhetoric from Republicans since Trump has been so protectionist and his rhetoric but if you start seeing them ever hit the road and like these tariffs he's been imposing the way they function as a tax on the team or the way they hurt producers in the United states um\nIt it kind of illustrates the way the deal I mean the deal\nYeah average a it's a win for the president um it's also a relief to me as a tax and it's so much a\nLess far reaching than what the president himself has discussed wanting since he was on the campaign trail um and I think that points to the fact that ultimately the people in there and then ... trading ... than it is really wanted to get a deal done that would preserve the central structure and president NAFTA\nWhile the White House has been celebrating this deal President Trump is under renewed scrutiny about his finance is on the heels of a pair of reports\nFor says the president's net worth has dropped more than a billion dollars since twenty Fifteen meanwhile the New York times published a an extremely detailed investigation\nOf the president's finances and inheritance\nAnd found among other things the president inherited far more money from his father than he's previously indicated and that and again this is according to the times report that he and his siblings engaged in what can only really be characterized as fraudulent practices to deceive the IRS low balling real estate appraisals setting up a dummy corporation to pass money\nFrom Trump's father to the kids without paying state taxes now\nThe statute of limitations has long since up on all of this the IRS could still impose significant fines but\nThis is President Trump's iris at the moment anyway so does any of this matter [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I mean I I think the allegations are surrounding well three things or one that he was a self made billionaire um I I I think has been swirling around that in some parts in some ways I think a reinforces why he has had a reluctance to to release his tax returns\nOn the second part about his diverge auction in his OWN Network that assets in large part\nI'm increasingly a President Trump's assets were really a product of his brand I it was more about putting the Trump name on items and people wanting to go there increasingly you become more polarizing people are less inclined to want to to purchase or stay at Trump branded things\nUm and finally I think that the underlying issue is whether there was fraud involved and I think this will just may not ever get investigated but I think it then Haitians calls for a you know changes of the law that require releases of tax returns and and and the like\nJay higher is an assistant professor of political science at Texas southern university co host Houston Public media's party politics podcast Eric agreed or is a columnist with the

N. dot org and he tours the country to talk about solutions to climate change is giving a presentation at the UAE Chilton ballroom tonight called solving\nClimate change with courage and conservative principles back in twenty sixteen our own Maggie Martin sat down with English talk about what prompted him to change his mind all those years ago the first step\nWas my son coming to me when I was running again and do for you know I had been in Congress six years saying climate changes nonsense I was out six years doing commercial real estate law than I was running again in two thousand and for\nA for the same seats so my son just turned Eighteen he's voting for the first time he came to me and said dad I'll vote for you but you're going to clean up your act on the environment is the first of three steps from the second step was getting on the science committee go into an article in the evidence from the ice cores railings\nThird step was really a spiritual like another science committee trip a great Barrier Reef or the climate scientists showing this coral bleaching\nAnd I could tell in his face and voice denies that he was\nWorshipping God in the creation he's not wish me the creation that we should we shared a world view\nAnd afterwards you had a chance to talk and he told me about conservation changes he was making in his life in order to love God and love people like I write inspired I Want to be like Scott here in the ... the climate scientists loving God and loving people so I came home and introduce that raise wages cut carbon acted two thousand nine got me a little bit of trouble in at a very red district\nHow did your Republican colleagues that how did your constituents react to your change change of heart and you're a change of policy towards climate change\nAnd that really is that it is is a change of heart and that's really what we're about here you know this is so much of this it offends a scientist you know the ... who think versus maybe rational but it's really a hard issue more than a head issue if we can get through the heart rejection on climate change the head would clear so rapidly\nBecause the science is clear but the economics or even clear I mean there's just such agreement in economics profession about what to do here just simply price in\nThe negative extra analogy as they call it in other words the hidden costs associated with the fuel is if you just put those in the fuel attached to the fuel\nDidn't a free enterprise system can deliver solutions right now I Can't deliver solutions cause the incumbent fuels aren't accountable so how did they respond to a well their constituents thoughts\nAre that it it seemed to heresy you know it seems that I'd crossed to the other side that I was now battling for the other team or something you know and um\nSo um I got tossed out at a Republican primary in June of two thousand and ten tossed out quite badly actually got only twenty nine percent of the vote after twelve years in Congress which is a rather spectacular face plant I suppose\nAnd that was a reaction from her constituents what about your peers you're conservative colleagues\nWell I think that you know there are a lot of members of Congress who\nWho must be affected by the science who are affected by the science and are affected by their kids coming home from college you know and the and this summer I'm sure their conversations around the kitchen table mom dad you're in Congress saying these things do you realize\nThis just really retro what you're saying you know it's just completely out of step with what you're paying for me to learn at the college or University You're sending me too\nAnd mom and dad all of my peers all my age group wants to act on climate change so\nDo you have anything to offer as a conservative do you have a an alternative to regulatory approach\nIf you do step forward so I'm hopeful those conversations are going on in members of Congress households\nAre we've got all all of the food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom enterprise the best universities ... capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt\nThe economy has been going in ... and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and our fix the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for we put our minds to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do it but there are some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nThat we're ... we're slipping a bit to make all that we have not had more we can or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's extreme quite well and we should treat them very respectfully\nBut you're actually correct his trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody back into that look we devised the president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand that you should uh China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property down enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamond self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy in there a lot of other big banks still a lot of I I'm going to be competing window of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more than ... there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find your Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also practical one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want Jake more chase me the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would be I think would be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWell so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy is that is true for banks trooper auto companies are two ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is the clients\nThat it's not the company because
