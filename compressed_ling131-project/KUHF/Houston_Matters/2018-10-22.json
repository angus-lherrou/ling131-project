I mean they do not do anything you want\nWhen you were doing the phone sex when you were the person on the phone\nDid you like an invisibility of it like one of the things I've always loved about radio is that like your ear invisible people make you up visibly however they want to inspect especially before the days of the Internet Internet anybody could access your picture whenever they wanted to\nBut um did did you like that invisibility with somebody could imagine you however they wanted their fantasy to look like\nIt was ... I mean it was kind of amazing is really interesting that there were a lot of things fighting with each other positive and negative I once went on a job interview I went on like two or three job interviews before I got a shot and I remember feeling like oh\nI didn't get the job because I'm black or I didn't get the job because of that is something about my parents um it makes me on\nUnemployable and so going to this company where unless otherwise specified if you picked up the phone and you're on the phone you're a hundred percent white [noise]\nUnless they're different life there's like black on line there's Latino Caroline and there is Asian girl line and other than that you are white so a lot of people assumed you are white well yeah a base on my voice and I also would make my voice a little bit wider [laughter]\nBut also but like we couldn't hire you if you had no ability to make your voice white\nNow because I put them in on the phone wanted to talk to that's who they want to talk to now the company was ran by Ninety five percent plus size black women that's hilarious it was\nI mean it was so it I mean it's so interesting that like we vocally you have no value unless you're a white but if you're ... you're only smart enough to work here if you're a black woman and we were all plus size and none of you know these men would not\nNormally be into us and if they worried so I get the fetish or whatever you know if we wouldn't you know we're not seen as being\nUm you know\nWe're not seen as being beautiful and worthy of love this weird way can I say

city that that was the path and so I was just praying that that that not that I Would get the role\nBut that my life would begin that I Would be on the path and here I Am because\nNo matter what is the idea of like you laugh you know you plan in God's laugh you know whatever I was writing from whatever I thought I was running to that's not my path from my past or at least it wasn't my path then I mean to be a first time actress twenty four it's\nThat's pretty old you know to be a first time actress like people start acting like teenagers and um get\nThere I was because that's what my

U. T. Austin is covering Trump's visit to Texas or early voting is underway\nElection officials say they're expecting a higher turnout than usual and the coming days Texas has been flooded with a lot of money in the past several weeks particularly for the closely watched Senate race between incumbent Ted Cruz and his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nDana Spain who lives in Austin says she always votes but this election feels particularly important so you voted first thing that morning um\nThere was no way I was not going to be here uh they met at the polls opened I've been telling people what am I getting hit by a bus Monday afternoon and I didn't vote of no way\nPresident Trump is holding a rally in Houston today and an effort to dry support for crews on the first day of voting for NPR News I'm Ashley Lopez in Austin\nBig tech is that the White House today and NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports companies including Google Amazon and IBM are considering the possibility of employees doing tours of duty with the government\nWhen it comes to technology the federal government lags behind and that hasn't been helped by a widening gap between left leaning Silicon Valley and the Trump Administration\nSo I'm basically just attorney for example it since subpoenas to other companies that also handled has its chemicals to see what they did when Harvey was coming in\nTo provide essentially a baseline for comparison\nA the subpoenas are being fought by the defense attorneys by simply saying that that's not appropriate information to get and that sort of reflects the the tooth and nail approached the litigation so far\nUh Houston attorney rusty hardens representing argument in this case or what does that tell you\nAbout the company's approach will I mentioned tooth and nail a little earlier a ... of rusty Hardin a legend in the trial bar in Houston and he's done well for being a very energetic and tenacious litigator is obviously one of our top criminal defense lawyers in town\nHe's also are not as well known but he's also handled environmental prosecutions before he was involved in I think previously at least one major criminal prosecution or where he basically find similar types of charges\nWhen did you expect the actual trial will get started right now the company has requested a trial date in early next year and in part they're trying to get the criminal matter resolved in because they're also looking at a Welter other lawsuits\nAre they're being food by the Harris County attorney on civil charges to both recover cost of the response but also to force the company to go through a third party party audit essentially to have a person look over their shoulder and make sure how they're doing things and force them to change the way they're operating\nThey're also looking at class action lawsuits another office by neighbors who are seeking damages\nThe criminal trial obviously\nInteracts with those other actions or to the extent there's information and civil trials that affect the criminal trial and vice versa\nIt creates some risks for the individuals and the company so they want to try and get the criminal trial rooting for moving ahead is what happens in this trial just significant for ... or for other industrial companies as well\nWell the the this is a bellwether case there is a lot of interest a lot of attention a lot of concern among industrial operators who are watching this case because essentially\nIt creates the possibility that even companies that think that they've gotten their a compliance in a row and they're complying with regulations may still face possible criminal liability if they are deemed to have acted in our reckless fashion which isn't really defined by particular statutory requirements\nSo out you know basically they're gonna have to rethink about how they prepare for hurricane some disasters the next time around\nTracy ... teaches environmental law at the University of Houston Law
