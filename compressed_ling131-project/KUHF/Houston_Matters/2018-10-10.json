Bennett who joins us now Travis hey are these flare ups just occurring in West Texas\nI'm not just in west Texas the managers they mostly in West Texas just because that's where most of the states in the country really is a drilling is happening but it's not you know limited to that happens in other parts of the state why is this such a significant issue\nIt depends on who you ask 'em frankly I'm sure that there are some industry who would say it's not that significant of an issue you know it's not that big a deal to us the amount of gas being flared like I said there in the story is is is\nLow compared to the amount of gas that is produced um but basically you know when when the state according to say data hit record high flaring in January at least ... you know the latest numbers I've seen\nThat was about seven twenty billion cubic feet of natural gas being essentially wasted um so that's a lot of lost money for companies in for the state's coffers\nAnd you have local environmental concerns like air quality near these sites and you know just frustrations from some locals even um astronomers including the McDonald's or Victoria about the night sky is getting brighter and light pollution issues what to state regulators have to say about this [noise]\nIt is pretty unlikely they will get involved on this issue I spoke with one regulator Texas railroad commissioner Ryan sitting who said\nLook defining what waste is in the industry for regulators is kind of tough because yes they could go in and they could shut down oil production until the associated gas coming up with it and the flaring comes down\nA bit sit and told me you know in that situation since the oil is more valuable that's what ... are really going after you then maybe essentially be letting the oil go to waste and you know beyond that uh various oil and gas regulators and Texas through the years have made it clear they view the industry is a good thing for the states\nEarlier this year one regulator wing Christian said the biggest things threatening the industry was politically correct to driven environmental anti oil and gas science\nSo you know you get the idea of regulators here just hesitant to put burdens on industry so I doubt you'll see any action there\nOn the other hand there are critics out there I'm sure of this or who would want them to get involved\nOh sure definitely um the Environmental Defense fund you know just done a lot of work analyzing flaring rates are points back to the Nineteen forties when uh the railroad commission\nState regulators did shut down entire oil fields to get wearing under control so yeah I mean they at least would like to see some regulatory action they say even if it's just slowing down production until pipelines and infrastructure can catch up\nUm but again I think just realistically here in Texas\nNot likely to happen does this mean there's just really no accountability for this [noise]\nUm it's a form of self regulation I guess yeah pretty much\nWhich after the oil companies themselves to do it as it's kind of so often the case and in the energy industry it tends to be you know they say seven stratospheric thanks very much You're welcome\nThis programming it's ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the ... men story of requests for true laugh open season restored worried them at the very Nineteen through November second Houston grand opera dot org [noise]\nUh working in Kulkarni has favors it's got the largest percentage of Asian American voters or of any congressional district in the state working in Olsen Staver is not only is incumbency but that it's still a um majority are Anglo district or just barely\nA and it's it's got a a long conservative heritage so that's something that he can rely on potentially closer race for him than than anyone that he's previously run but the odds are still in his favor\nBranded let's turn to the Texas Legislature in state Senate district seven incumbent Paul Bettencourt is being challenged by\nDavid Romero what can you tell us about that race this is also a pretty big a suburban district it shaped like a giant C. C. for conservative because that traditionally been the way that this district has gone it runs basically from hunters creek and relieved Jersey a village around to Cyprus than than ... spring\nThis is a plus Nineteen Trump district so it is very heavily Republican it's pretty safe from a surge I think that just objectively any district which is sort of above a plus seven Trump district is probably in play in this case it seems\nLike it's not this is Dan Patrick's old district which Betancourt is won by better than Seventy percent in the moments that he's run\nThe challenger here is David Romero who is raised very little money less than five thousand dollars and his running on a fairly generic\nPlatform he does include a among the things he talks about a flooding and flood prevention so that's something that may get some residents in that district which was hit heavy by some of the um release of the reservoirs after Harvey\nState Senate district Seventeen brand and features incumbent Joan Huffman facing challenge or read a Lucy do which we know about this district in that race\nI like this race because I think it's a a matchup that Democrats can potentially when this was shaped like an upside down shrimp which makes sense because the district runs from basically Freeport Lake Jackson area all the way up through sugar land and kind of hooks Belair\nAnd onto the reckoning look for another way\nWhat do you mean that you should spend his life in service of other people's joy what does that mean\nWell I mean I think because he's taken so much joy out of the world\nThat a more appropriate I friend I Would be to put that joined back in that to me a better sense as symmetry and um I don't necessarily know what that looks like and I don't necessarily think it's my job to decide for him what happens to him\nBut I also think that we put too much emphasis on what happens to the person who causes to harm rather than on the person who experience with it because you know in this case you know there's\nAn active um pursuit of him they're trying to extradite him eventually maybe if they ever catch him and bring it back\nTo the United states there'll be a trial and all that that sense of justice is placed on what happens to him rather than on what happens to me and the ways that I find healing and I'm much more interested in what happens to victims and defining justice in that way\nIf an injustice anything that gets between us that our capacity for joy perhaps justice is anything that makes the condition of joy at profitability egg\n[noise] a lot of your writing the other soldiers said was about changing your relationship with the story of what had happened to you because you've spent so much time living in fear or simply that books should have got you back on little ground so to speak and then this one seems more boat you trying to move forward now\nSure I think the other side was very much a question for me to change my relationship to the past to change my relationship to this one really really traumatic memory and um to change my brain and certain way so that I wasn't\nFeeling like I was still inside this trauma that was happening that I could in fact realized that that story was over and that I I could start a new one\nUm and this book takes up where that left off of okay if that story is about over what is the new one look like for me\nAnd of course it does deal with my own experience of injustice but also it deals with um the injustice that eye witness everyday ecological disaster racial violence sexual violence beyond just what I've experienced\nAs well as you know mass shootings there's a way in which the way that we understand justice on a personal level certainly applies to the way that we understand justice on a public a political a social and world level\nAnd it was gonna ask you how you're everything we've seen in recent years may be an even greater national conversation about justice police shooting ... that sort of thing how those conversations changed how you think about justice and how has your experience do you think change do you see justice in those cases\nI think you know if we take that Kavanaugh hearings where someone professor Buffy Ford accused a powerful man Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nAnd she was heard she was brought to the hearing but there was a way in which all at the same\nWays that we have typically discredited survivors um we saw played out again in many ways in real time and when Brett Kavanaugh than you know sat down at the table and began his testimony\nI think we saw a way in which what's at stake here is not even necessarily just a seat on the Supreme Court but the power to define what is real\nAnd that he was forceful and loud and adamant that his experience with real\nAnd professor Buffy Ford was timid and vulnerable and also insistent that her experience with real but for some reason you know sexual assault is the only crime that we have in our society where the victim is subject and subjected to doubt\nYou know when there's a murder we have a dead body and so there's no doubt that it occurred and if an eyewitness says I saw someone murdered that person that person's witness counts as evidence in the trial\nBut in terms of sexual assault assault a woman's own witness what has happened to her doesn't count and the same way\nAnd so I think in this situation justice looks like us listening to women talk about their lives and believing them and taking women's word as an expression\nA description of reality rather than as a fantasy whereas an imagination or as some sort of hysterical conspiracy theory right\nAnd I think you know it doesn't necessarily look like him being punished but also not getting a promotion isn't punishment that's just not getting a promotion\nDuring oldest we heard a lot of people men probably saying things like war any woman could make accusations and ruin a man's life without any proof measuring how do you respond when ... things like that\n[noise] um I spend a lot of time grabbing my teeth and my ...\nVery frustrating because I think\nThere have been other historical moments when there's a moment of reckoning with the epidemic of sexual violence against women\nAnd every time it seems to be transformed\nFrom an epidemic of sexual violence when women are talking about the reality that they're experienced and people are realizing that it's not just one woman or two women that is a widespread thing and that I think it's so hard for people to wrap their heads around\nThat it's much easier to believe that in fact we are having an epidemic a false allegations of against men [noise] um but in and as I said before it seems to be a question of the power to define what is real\nThat women are talking about the reality of their lives this violence that we've experienced that so many women have experienced and people are saying you're making this up or your you must be making this up because this can't possibly be real\nAnd I think it's easier to more comfortable for men and women to believe that that's the case rather than to understand the ways that this touches every sphere of society and perhaps even reaches into their very own family that's an uncomfortable a very uncomfortable idea to grapple with\nAnd so it's easier to just dismiss it and say that it it can't possibly exist\n[noise] ... talking with writer ...

political power who are serving the interests of the corporations that in many cases contribute to this changing climate that creates a a a difficult scenario under which you could see any force coming to bear rice\nSure but I mean we do live in a capitalist society in our in our country and I do know for a fact and have worked with some cases of corporations are doing a lot of self policing I mean it's not in their best interest either particularly flooding and\nAnd irregular involvement with nature that we're seeing these days\nSo what I've seen from corporations is their own reduction

don't buy the rumor that Nikki Haley is going to challenge Trump on twenty twenty that's not going to happen\nI don't see that either and I do think that she probably wanted to take a break she's been in public service for ten straight ears and the un job under the Trump Administration is ... than it has been under some previous president\nWhich has got to have some of the young kids to yeah that would be too\nBut also I think you know Trump actually went two months without a departure [laughter]\nHey which was amazing [laughter] I'm just going to leave [laughter]\nThere are a lot of cringe worthy that I tried to put out of my mind but the ones that stuck in my mind that were positive were ironically I Believe it was fascinating to where there's a young man who's a wheelchair user and like all the other kids these you know making out\nYou know then he gets an axe to their head like everybody else [noise]\nI thought\nThat was awesome because I hadn't seen a lot of that at the time it's fascinating if you think that what was the first time I remember seeing a character was it isn't really portrayed and what impact did that make and and the different responses were kind of fun to hear\nYeah it's interesting you bring that up because I was thinking about that as I was watching the documentary and the person I thought of was Jerry jewel who then shows up in your documentary that wow it's amazing how it in her case she was on the facts of life and appeared on Sesame Street and for\nAn entire generation I think she was\nMaybe the first person we'd come face to face with who had cerebral palsy and allowed people to understand oh this is just a part of who she is not who she is\nYeah it was for her and with Jim trash um who is on highway to have it around the same time I've since become friends with Jerry and Jim and um and it was funny for me because\nYou know I grew up seeing them also on TV and things and then when I started my career in in California and in Los Angeles\nBecame acquainted with them they're in the documentary and now I'm having to say we're friends and they're fabulous people that made a big difference still to this day Jerry gets mail from

celebrity\nOne of the points of some disagreement among the folks you interviewed is whether it's appropriate for people who do not have disabilities to portray characters who do or what's your take on that\nHas a filmmaker I Believe that if there is an opportunity to cast a person with a disability for that role of a person with that same disability you should\nSometimes there's financial constraints based on\nThe budget in the film you need a lead actor who's already a star to perform that\nPart right so you're forced\nTo hire someone to act in yesterday when a lot of awards for those parts\nBecause it's a difficult job when it's done properly however it's important that we also give actors with disabilities opportunities to become stars to become like Peter ... become people that are box office powerful enough where they can\nShine and in a movie and the only reason the only way you will do that is if you give them parts and they build up their career unfortunately that's not happening at all people will be afraid to hire someone\nWith a disability because oh it might slow down production and all cost us money when that's not the case these are people that want to work and have the talent but if there is no employment opportunities how long are they going to\nStick around if there's no outlet for their talent you know it doesn't have to be written\nAs a character with a
