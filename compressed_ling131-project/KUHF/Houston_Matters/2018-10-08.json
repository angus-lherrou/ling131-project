Atlanta but the Braves grabbed the momentum Sunday beating LA with tubing home runs a grand slam by twenty year old Ronald attuned your junior and a solo home run by Freddie Freeman that turned out to be the winning run\nLet me talk about risk or we're not just talking about homebuyers fight we're also talking about perhaps developers do they run to find\nAnd she'll risk that if they build in these areas that necessarily that doesn't mean that home buyers are going to come and buying this area\nI mean that that's true in theory but I think we've seen in practice that buyers are willing to accept that risk wherever they want to live um and that's that's why are we see development being added now and you know town homes and the three or four or five hundred thousand dollar ... and the and the ...\nI mean it related right when developers built into the floodplains they're only risk is really comes to do people by the homes and then once people by the homes the people who are taking on the risk is the homeowner and the federal taxpayers to the national flood insurance program\nAnd the national flood insurance program to put it bluntly is fairly broken it doesn't work very well I'm In the least and it comes to discouraging development floodplain areas or encouraging people not to live in those areas um if developing as occurred\nSo you get subsidized insurance you pay you for subsidized insurance the flood you'd do what we were talking about earlier you do whatever you need to do to stay in your home if that's what you want to do and when you fight again you ... you know the federal government will pay it out again you can rebuild and you can go over and over and over again\nAnd that's yeah that's that's so true and the the other point to make on that as your I mean I talked to a few realtors for this story who are frankly not comfortable with the sort of additives that they're going from their buyers they have some buyers they said don't tell me anything that flooded\nBut a majority of the buyers that several ... or they're working with\nIf they see something they like they buy it like well I'm going to buy flood insurance I'll be covered and I'm getting a great deal in this house 'cause that's what\nThe the other they're too there's a whole bunch of people who aren't buying homes right they're not buying developed homes are buying homes that are already and if I planted a flooded and they're renting homes that have been caught by investors that they knew were flooded already and again they don't take on the rest they put that risk onto the ranchers and that makes it a exceedingly difficult people choose to live in these areas\nNot because they're very happy to live in a flood at home or home that is funded many cases they're choosing to live in these areas are by our rent these flooded homes because it's in a good school district and it's the prices might be cheaper now that it flooded there's a lot of perverse incentives where it encourages people to live in places where they might not choose to otherwise\nThat's Matt Dempsey he's data editor for the Houston Chronicle we also heard Mike Morris city hall reporter for the

this is Houston matter son Craig Cohen ancestry DNA testing services have been all the rage in recent years but sometimes the results can catch you off guard case in point there's a large group in North America in particular in the Rio Grande valley in New Mexico who are descendants of water known as converse shows that Spanish for converted\nThey were Jewish but were forced into Christianity in Spain and Portugal and the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries this period most infamously includes the Spanish Inquisition these descendants in many cases have no idea their families were once Jewish\nOne who may be a part of that group is Dr ... Hernandez in a professor is she's a professor world cultures and literature at the University of Houston and she's giving a lecture on the history of converse shows in Texas and Mexico Thursday night at the match Dr Hernandez welcome to Houston matters thank you\nAlso with us has been at Greenspan president and CEO of family tree DNA into Houston based consumer DNA testing company but it wasn't on the program thank you and we welcome you to our conversation as well it's seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can email us at talk in Houston matters dot org\nDr Hernandez how did the population known as converse shows come to be\nIn fourteen Ninety two when Spain decided a dad or the king the monarchy in Spain decided that all the Jews either had to leave a convert\nMany of them left many of the ones that did not convert they left and they either when Jim anyway to Portugal and he went to southern Italy southern France even grief and eventually a large number came to the Americas\nAnd some some of these folks there were some who did convert and also came here right\nThere were a large number that converted but still maintain their rituals and beliefs uh secretly for centuries\nDid I I guess I mean one of the things that happens in any family is over generations some of those traditions will hold but others will start to melt away a little bit and I'm Wondering how many generations it's sort of takes a certain point do enough of those traditions\nSort of fall away that maybe you've got families today who had no idea that they're connected to this\nI think it varies among families I have met people that uh how many traditions and even have Hebrew name set the families gave them\nAnd they this is in the present day people that live in Los Angeles I've met people that have no idea at all or like in my family um my father's side they didn't eat pork and his generation\nI'm you know certain families would have different kinds of traditions there is one that seems to be widespread and we're not really sure if it's totally related to a secret\nJews or just something that spread from the secret uses the idea of sleeping your floor to the middle of the room almost everybody that you speak to that is of Mexican descent will say the women anyway we'll say that that's how their family would sweep\nThe room so they would have these traditions that may have connections reverberations within Judaism but just didn't know in fact that they were Jewish chick traces traces of them\nBut then again I guess the other piece of this is that's true about modern culture in general there are all kinds of things that we can point to and say oh well that actually stems from Jewish tradition or that stems from Christian tradition or or another or face a but we've all sort of incorporated them\nThe point is so unusual is I I have met a number of people that have a very intense emotional investment in the Jewish ancestry to the point that when they start discussing it actually cry I've seen it a number of times and people from all over the southwest\nYou noted that ah your family maybe potentially is connected to this converse of population\nMy father's maternal grandfather was I'm Jay too\nAnd what is what is Jay to me I think one let me let me turn back Greenspan to explain that\nWell Jay too is a branch of the tree of mankind found in males and uh and these branches have geographical specificity Jay to was from the northern part of the fertile crescent\nOkay so we need to explain that a little mental and so so the fertile crescent is an area that the ah that that the original he Bruce who became Jews\nCame out of its today populated primarily by either a Christian Arabs or Muslim Arabs but there were Jews there two thousand years ago and so when we find people in the Hispanic world who are J. one\nSouthern fertile crescent or J. to northern fertile crescent the likelihood that they have a connection\nTo to uh Jews is pretty good and it's one hundred percent certain that they are either part of the Jewish diaspora or part of the Muslim expansion which started after the advent of Islam so Dr Hernandez\nWhat's the lesson you take away from this about our expectations are definitions about race ethnicity religion these things that that we all used to define who we are\nI think the point is that and many people might disagree with me but race is socially constructed\nAnd ethnicity is socially constructed it's your identity is what you think you are and what other people think you are so there's two different ways of looking at it and\nThe secret Jew issue I did a late dinner and he is rather controversial because there are some groups that say just because your great great great grandmother was doesn't mean you are\nAnd and the people that are very emotionally invested get upset and say no that's that's right that's what I Believe I Am so there's some tension there\n... and I guess there there is also tension and some who may learn whether it's Jewish versus Christian or a a racial identity or an ethnicity of some sort that they find out that they have through DNA testing in some cases they may not want to be whatever it is that they're told that\nYou know that at all or whatever the actor it ... percent solid way to\nSee that in life and I but I thought how did you read a lot or an accurate but like\nAll right thanks for the call and for the question well first of all I I Want to tell you that the that the situation you're talking about as it relates to Africa will eventually self correct Africa's just under sample\nAnd when you're under sampled or you can tend to get some surprising results or results that don't have a very very high confidence level on the other hand uh my guess is that the\nUm European countries uh for all of U.S companies that do these percentage tests are quite\nAre quite well sampled and therefore I think that there's a good reason for you to believe that a vet at minimum Fifteen Percent of your DNA comes from northern European populations\nI I guess one thing I Want to come back to to sort of wrap this up is that we heard that caller suggested you know she doesn't believe that or feel that your ... she's comfortable with the identity that she\nHas lived her life as so is it okay to simply say All right well this may be what the genetic say but that doesn't necessarily control or impact who I represent myself to be in the world\nWell it goes back to the identity issues that she is who she believes she is and there has been some question about people if they find Fifteen Percent Swedish does that mean they need to start thinking about being Swedish or likes Swedish music or and and it's really not about that is about how they feel\nWho they are\nHouston's archeology now hosts converse owes the secret passed as a lecture by Dr Murray Theresa Hernandez professor world cultures and literature at the University of Houston

see\n'em so it's all exciting and fun and getting into\nA whole new environment congratulations thank you we welcome any questions you have the dog or cat companion in your life at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can email us talk at Houston matters dot org\nA couple of things you want to get to before we get to those questions October is adopt a dog month this is according to the American humane association also adopt a sheltered dog my specifically for the SPCA alright make your case why should someone who doesn't have a dog or can accommodate another\nAdopt one the smoke because dogs are awesome just um I just can't imagine living without our dog um but they're proven health benefits to dog ownership a we know it lessens the risk of cardiovascular disease or is actually a recent study that showed even people who already had a heart attack or have cardiovascular disease\nAnd will lessen the risk of an aim neither cardiovascular incident and we know it lowers blood pressure and another thing um that recently getting more and more press\nIs loneliness ah loneliness being chronically lonely can shape seven or eight years off your life\nAnd when you consider it that the fastest growing segment of our population is people over the age of eighty five um who are also often feeling lonely I'm having a dog can do so much to alleviate that\nAre there some questions oh you should ask before adopting a dog musher\nI'm One are you capable of taking care of it do you have the space for it can you provide the exercise needed I can you cover the the basic supplies veterinary care and things like that um so it's certainly you need to be equipped to have a dog\nHow about the time I'm On one of the you know I grew up with dark shirt I Love dogs I don't have a dog we know we need to talk well we've been talking about but one of the reasons why is the combination of long commute in Jerusalem work days I I don't feel right about leaving a dog alone at home for so many hours\nRight and that's that that is definitely fair 'cause dogs are people pleaser Z I'm so there are certainly ways to have a dog even when you have long hours you need to be very careful of the breed that you get a getting a border collie or retriever or something that's high energy and he talks a lot of exercise would not be appropriate\nBut if you get an older dog that's already a very low energy breed that only needs short walks in the morning before you do and when you get home in the evening\nTo not certainly possible and if you think a dog isn't going to do it there there's lots of other species out their cats rabbits all sorts of things that still give you the benefit to pet ownership\nShall we get to some questions let's do it let's start with an email from Tim who says I have a Fifteen year old Beagle that seems to have lost her ability to hold her pee through the night so she wakes up wakes me up at least once in the middle of every night\nIs there any supplement or food change I can try anything else I can do I haven't slept through the night in the year oh wow\nI'm yeah that's a lot of sleep so certainly the first thing I Would do is have your dog evaluated for an underlying medical condition a kidney disease can certainly make it harder because the urine is dilute and so if you can't concentrate your during your Blatter's going to feel more quickly\nAnd so if your dog does have kidney disease there are things that can be done for that ah we also want to rule out a bladder infection that could be causing a problem so that is certainly where I Would start um is with a full medical work up to make sure there's not an underlying medical condition that needs to be corrected\nLet's take a call we of Austin on the line from the woodland Austin what's your question for Dr Tiller\nRio good so here I have been getting a ... yard you know dark they've got four and a lot\nTo talk to raise the guy with the right amount of each other right they got more from the same lady in California that they've been getting us broad\nAnd when we had them this year or they were on like a um you know like a drug ... animal drug court where they drive and cross country and where they got here are the female or if you're if you're a buffered bumps type of trauma or like a beer from the people that were bringing\nHer ear if I'm terrified of man you can't cut no man but if you do your green bloody murder of like being physically or energy or by the way you why did or there'll be could try to try and get over that show her that you know he's not\nGoing to be right there yeah this is going to care right I've never seen anything like\nOh yeah that I mean that's really rough um that's going to be a long term issue um that's going to require a lot of patience on your parents' part I'm of course on the dog's part and I would recommend\nHad a fish processing plant in combination Japan twenty six

it's not just a few bad apples is going to go to or who to give me wondering the system itself\nIs structurally wrong and there's some data to support that view in twenty sixteen the government investigated more than a thousand companies to host interns and found nearly three quarters of them in violation of some labor or safety law customs ... is with a government agency set up last year to regulate the program\nMy impression is that the doors who agreed to go over to the program they tend to exaggerate the programs\nHe says serious violations are rare and nobody's forcing people to come indeed many interns willingly pay a small fortune to brokers in their home country just to get a spot\nWhen back home who came from Vietnam a couple of years ago says he paid roughly eight thousand dollars us for a chance to make good money in concrete construction in civil let us know cementing but soon he says he and other interns were tasked with doing radiation clean up\nAt sites affected by

related to radioactive stuff we wouldn't have never done it\n... has since left that job and staying at a shelter for displaced interns despite his troubles he says he wants a new internship and does
