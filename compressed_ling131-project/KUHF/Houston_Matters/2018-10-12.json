always said that that was the greatest job he ever had and I I\nTend to believe he's probably felt that way you really did and what he heard from these people was what\nYou know a lot of the middle class it said in the last election that they were being ignored the working class they felt they were being taken advantage of by the government there were things too many taxes and and these were all things that affected Reagan deeply because people told them their sob stories and they played on his heart strings\nAnd if you played on Ronald Reagan's heartstrings he really took it to heart and so his politics gradually began to shift against big government against big taxes all the things that really were the bedrock of conservatism\nBut do you think the empathy also played back his own childhood as as having an alcoholic father as you write about as having to move constantly and and just having this very up and down a time growing up your\nYou know he always felt that he had to pull

S. S. as astronaut Scott Kelly learned and twenty Fifteen and sixteen\nKelly spent nearly a full year aboard the international space station as part of an experiment studying the long term effects on the human body of living in zero gravity\nKelly has a new book of photographs out it's a collection of images he gathered during his ear in space it's called infinite wonder\nLast fall or own Joshua was in spoke with Kelly about his year in space and re adjusting to life back on earth which is Kelly described in his memoir called endurance was pretty unpleasant experience when he first landed\nYou know the symptomatic stuff the stuff you feel or she is a pretty much cleared up so I kinda feel like I did before launched certainly there's the stuff you can't see the effects of long term space flight and I'm you know hopefully those will never become an issue\nYou mentioned in the book that one of the first things you did when you got home was jumping to your swimming pool\nAnd and you just you talk about how there there's nothing that sort of is is similar to just jumping into water after being in space for so long\nAnd one of the things that interest me is that in zero gravity it almost looks like you're swimming sort of 'cause you're kind of just freely floating um but you know obviously there's a difference is can you describe that difference is there is there a way to really like put that into words well I think where where\nYou're you're talking about two different things there's the feeling of the water around our ...\nOur our bodies which in space because we don't have a shower we don't have a bath tub\nYou don't have that for a really long time so it's something you miss the feeling of water and\nMy colleague me showed my rushing cause were not friend that I spent a year on the space station with he had the same desire to as soon as he can he wanted to jump in a swimming pool and go swimming [noise] um but you mentioned how floating in space looks like you're floating in the water\nAnd uh you know they're both similar your your new truly buoyant or if you're floating but gravity still affects you so it's not exactly the same but it's as close as we can to are simulating\nZero G for long periods of time on earth\nWhen you're in space you talk a little bit about how your senses are a little bit different like your inner ear takes a while to get focused and and what are you when you have the lights off you turn it on and your brain kind of has to reorient itself or are there any other ways that your senses are affected by being in space for so long\nSure you know it was so what you're talking about his service stimulus system rush which are these little hair hairs in our inner ears that sense gravity\nAnd can tell you know allow you to tell which way up and down and your orientation when you're in space you don't have that you saw your your orientation is more based on what you see visually a versus what you feel based on gravity\nI'm so that sense is affected uh certainly your sense of smell is is affected because you have a fluid shift\nI'm On earth are uh all the fluid in our bodies kind of pushed down towards our legs\nAnd you get in space you don't have that anymore whether it's blood or lymphatic fluid or whatever is a more a shifted upwards and that seems to affect people's sense of smell which because a smell is very important to taste affects people's sense of taste\nA hearing I wouldn't say it's affected but the space station is certainly a loud\nOther census touch when I got back after being in space for a year my skin had that really touched anything with any kind of a pressure so when I got back\nMy legs my back anything you know when you're sitting or lying down that all that skin was kind of inflamed so I guess you know there was a change in that sense as well\nSomething else that's interesting about the space station is how clean it has to be a you're constantly cleaning up dust and stuff that might float around when you came back obviously it's a much dirtier place was that something I don't know did you kind of wonder if that were you looking\nTo that again to having some some grit being back on the ground well\nYou know we we have to clean a lot because in honor of thing in gravity you know stuff falls to the floor so it's easy to clean in space it might wind up in a filter or are attached to a wall because we move around um with our hands\nTranslate you know sometimes with our feet but our hands touch a lot of stuff\nAnd we are in that enclosed environment or we want to make sure that the surfaces or clean as there is no microbial growth or mold or you know stuff like that that could affect our health so we do spend a lot of time cleaning\nThe I guess I I Do appreciate the fact that I don't have to wash the walls anymore or the ceiling yeah [laughter] [noise]\nSo you mentioned the sense of smell and and one of the things you describe in the book is the smell of space which I mean most people don't have any idea what that's like ... what is the smell of space\nThat's what we call it right I think it's not the smell of nothing it's really the smell of\nThe the hardware the aluminum and steel the materials um that are exposed to ah the space environment whether it's because of micro gravity and off gassing or you know exposures to the harsh rays of the sun there's certain it creates a certain smell\nAnd I probably need to look into this some more and do a little bit more research because people are really interested in it but\nTo me it smells like a welding like a welding smell or maybe ... on the fourth of July other people describe it as more like a sweet smell like they think it could be like something you might eat that kind of sweetness but to me it smells more like burn metal\nSo while you're up there you were doing a lot of experimenting there were there were multiple experiments that you were doing and some of the other crew members were doing you talk in the book about how\nYou had to do a lot of different experiments for a lot of different disciplines um some that maybe you weren't innately interested in but they you know it was part of your job or what were there any experiments that you were really into when you were doing that you were really fascinated by by operating on them\nWe had a bunch of uh rodents on board that we did some a science or with we're happy that they could donate themselves to to science our future\nThat was very exacting work it was interesting to me it was hard which I think made it more interesting we had flowers that I grew up in the space station as a pre core cursor to you know growing more complicated stuff uh some day going to Mars for nutritional purposes\nThat was interesting the public really connected with that so that was fun um but there's over four hundred different scientific experiments that went on on the space station per year some of those I was intimately familiar with the medical stuff so that was done on me should me the twin study with my\nBetween me and my brother mark and others that you have no involvement with but that doesn't mean they're any less important it's just their automated\nNow that you're back you are part of this long term study where they're comparing you and your identical brother mark how long is this going to go with this really just gonna follow you to the rest of your life at this point\nWell that I think it's good that they're doing something about this problem that has existed for a while\nBut it's bad that there had been so many studies and so much money spent on doing these studies and it just goes a lot of confusion with so many people and it it just seems as if\nWe do studies but there's not a lot of action happens when we do these studies and that's very frustrating to citizens especially the people who are flooded\nI think there needs to be a lot more action going on in any good to understand what the problem is and come up with solutions but this this study is only for the study it doesn't include the the construction the implementation the maintenance and when looked up on the corps the website to look at their budget\nAnd they actually have I think ten more floods studies going on in different parts of the country so there's a lot of studying going on and on about what's going on with floods\nBut I don't see a whole lot of actual action that's occurring and that's I I'm pretty sure that's what people when used them what to say they want to see some action\nThey want to see a real flood mitigation plan they want to see something that's being done to make this\nArea and this reason a lot more a resistance to these devastating floods that have been occurring over the last few years and and that's what I'd really like to see a you know sure we study it but last transfer all in that study into some actual action at least ...\nYeah no I agree with that and this is all very confusing to hear that a steady and then nothing happens and I think we started to equate the word steady with inaction installing and bureaucracy but I think this is a good thing I was I was confused myself and I was talking to the county judges office and\nI think it's important to point out that says a federal as steady this is there any court engineer and this needs to happen\nIf we want a third reservoir there have been studies that acts and Barker we know that those are problematic and need\nRepair their things and have you done this is not that study being done over again this is a new study that really gets the lay of the land and how everything works together how the bias connected and supposedly\nReally says is what is needed in terms of the third reservoir and other projects and maybe that says the cost and you know I think that this is actually a pretty helpful thing I trust when they say that there's going to be transparent said because we saw the way the county\nWas able to involve that or is that the town halls and have them come and look at maps and give input that actually so they say the input of of you know the average people who showed up\nWas actually put in to the plans that will be billed as a result of a Harris County voters passing overwhelmingly passing the flood not say that federal agencies that would be in charge of building some of these projects and we've got the accountability promised by the partner of Harris County and it's like and killed districts I think is very helpful thing\nGetting that feedback from the people who were affected were may be affected is so important and if they do that incorrectly that could just mess up the ... because we are being ... we know trust\nBecause there's a reason why there is interest now you're right Fred there's been too much talk and I never action finally hardly happen it shouldn't have taken Harvey to make then something by\nHarvey has happened and I really think that the priorities at some of the leadership of the county you know federal state that's quite sure about the state will see in the legislature but I think that some of the party's certainly at the county level and the federal level of changed they've open their eyes and this is a good sign\nMarker Robert well you know I mean I I Can't really disagree with anything specific about Fred early start saying here I mean it's hard to complain about research considering the problem that we're having here in Houston not just of Harvey but also the multiple floods that we've been having almost every single year I think bill king recently said that we seem to be having a five hundred year flood every five years\nI guess I share some of those concerns maybe in different ways that I'm hearing here because one of the things I couldn't quite grasp is how's it going to connect with the two and a half billion dollars on program that will you already passed\nI'm not clear on is this really going to take all these new account 'cause obviously the reservoirs have to deal with all of the things that are going on not just the reservoirs by themselves if you're not really looking at what are the other things at the city is going to be doing and what a developer is doing that's another item to enforcement or the lack of enforcement among developers when they are\nCovering the floodplain and not re mitigating like supposed to all those things you can do a study but if nobody addresses those issues and it just continues on and we see a lot of stories about really developers not taking that into account regardless of what our city code says\nSome kind of guarded in that hopefulness that hopefully this listen to something\nJust as my own little side note on this I Know people make a big deal about it federally funded off guys you know like at some other entity we're still paying for it so you know I think that it's good that we're getting some of the funds back that we're putting into a pot\nBut let's remember that part of something that other people are digging too as well but overall I think it's a good thing\nWell the difference between taking it out of your coffee can paint it out of that Mississippi and now I\nWould you rather ... well yeah but but but you know we're putting into the Mississippi and a bunch of other people to pull the hippie so it it kinda hides that accountability I so that's the point that\nPanel Harris County is poised to follow the city of Houston's lead by effectively banning so called robot Brussels\nHarris County already bans live sex acts at any place of business Robert sword first assistant county attorney says that in his reading that includes sex with anthropomorphic devices\nBut he believes it might be a good idea to amend the current sexually oriented business regulations the office of the Harris County attorney has been working with the county sheriff's office on such an amendment assistant chief Tim ... expects there'll be ready to present it to ... court within two weeks\nCounties effort is almost identical to the city of Houston's both have been prompted by an announcement last month by a Canadian company called ... dolls that plan to open a love dolls brothel\nHere in the bayou city please remember this is public radio in a family show is a a note again that Harris County is trying to match the city of Houston ban on so called robot Brussels and I ask you is this good bad or ugly\nWho wants it all of us are reverting either\n[laughter] well if you smoked for it's yours oh good\nLord I don't know what are we supposed to say it's good that are ugly the actual brothel or the attempt to stop it\nI suppose the attempt to match the city's ban\nYeah it's fine I mean that that's what people want I you know good lord\nI just think it's really bad about all this is your first conversation I associated the word at anthropomorphize them with something as wholesome as Walt Disney talking nice guy so now I've never been there [laughter]\nI Will say I have seen that what's that show a\nWell Jude Law I rather enjoyed him in a a guy I'm\nI enjoyed it you know just watching this and there's this west worlds on that show all said that that deals with this this theme but you're talking to a person who probably I Would entertain the idea legalizing prostitution because I just think that it's off all the way\nThat women are trafficked and I think that regulation could\nIt's always going to exist into regulation could do some good there in terms of this you know these things they objectify women the way that prostitution does as well and so if we're going to say one is illegal it's consistent to say\nThis thing is it legal as well have to say I'm probably more torn about it then then you would think because\nThere is a market for these things and we have to understand why that is people are lonely\nAnd this isn't the way to deal with it I guess but probably the way to deal with it is to you know get some help turn to friends when you're lonely and just kind of do the do the healthy things that we never good for mental health and not going to a robot brothel I Would not for that and and the man savvy and things that enrich mental health\nAh the thing I Do I Want to see people who go to something like this prosecuted not really so it's probably best just not\nTo allow it and all ... you know Greg you need to start picking such dry boring\n[laughter] and\nThere's so many ways to touch the subject I Do have mixed feelings about this as well I tried to do some research and I have to admit some of the pictures I saw on the Internet what these things looked like and how they act was I'm off putting and creepy [laughter] I just I just wanted creepy and um my libertarian side wants to cut a lot of people make their own choices\nI Would just sit up front that on this one I'm not going to lose sleep over people not being able to do this and just having to be forced to pick the home of course I did find out that to get one of these is gonna be ten thousand dollars apiece there's a place called true companion\nWhich isn't a lot of very side there\nHad knowledge that you know no no ...
