C. A. a first can you offer your take on that lawsuit and whether you anticipate that could have any impact on enrollment this year\nI don't think it will have impact on enrollment this year it could have a impact in the future if he successfully lawsuit I personally and I think our whole company would disagree with that lawsuit and say that that is not inappropriate my position to take\nAnd it's especially a inappropriate when kids not presented or\nOr anyone else in Texas has presented an alternative I'm\nFine with talking about how we to amend the Affordable CARE Act or how we might replace the Affordable CARE Act but let's have a discussion about what that looks like and simply filing\nA lawsuit to throw out the form of character as I say burned down the house before we even have the four plans for for building a new house just seems irresponsible to me I'm a very disappointed that uh the Texas is leading the charge to\nDismantle the Affordable CARE Act without an adequate replacement\nWhat'd you be able to can just very very briefly offer some thoughts on how are the ac it could be improved\nYes we need to have the ability to have more flexibility in the benefits offered it's a very rich benefit package and I think there's some people would like to have less her benefits that's actually been talked about by some people and so\nI think that's a reasonable approach or we need to look at the age and risk bans there's a the way the Affordable CARE Act was set up it did end up this incentivizing younger people like are charging them higher premiums but the\nOpposite of that is true for older people that that premiums are lower than they would have been otherwise we need to have a difficult but adult conversation about how do you balance between getting more young people insured and still protecting older folks\nWe also need to continue to let states have more flexibility and the administration or the program there's a lot of administrative expenses that we have because of the federal requirements\nThe good news is actually that uh there's proposal for give states more flexibility under what's called at Thirteen thirty two waiver\nAnd it's time for Texas to actually look at what they could do under the existing law with this Thirteen thirty to wherever to provide increased financial stability of the marketplace so that we can hold down rate and I think there's there's good opportunities within the existing law to make it work better for Texas\nThat was Kenya and a CEO of community health choice the Houston based nonprofit he's

context that will not walk through some recent developments in the political world and consider what's behind them with the help of political enlisting UH lecture Nancy\nSims and University of St Thomas political science professor John Taylor Nancy John ... back to the program Audi thank you\nAs we chat as always we welcome your thoughts to at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy or talk at Houston matters started work let's start with a few election related developments in recent days here in Texas\nA first there have been some complaints that people choosing to vote during early voting a ... and and I'm trying to do a straight ticket ballad are finding that as they reviewed their selections before casting their vote\nOr it may be one selection clips from a candidate they wanted to a candidate they didn't want\nNow according to the Texas secretary of state's office this is not a problem with the voting machines\nIt's that it's a human error or some have been arguing that the voting machines are outdated and apt to experience occasional pick up a but the secretary of state's office of single voters are hitting a button or using the selection we'll be for the strings finished rendering\nAnd then the process be selecting a pre filled candidates selection\nOf this is also happened apparently during past election cycles\nBoth political parties are warning voters not to rush as they cast their votes what are you making this [laughter] [noise]\nWell these voting machines are out of date first off let's just admitted there over they're Eighteen they're analog machines for good in there and a lot in their Eighteen years old I was on the committee that picked these voting machines\nAnd this machine was not might pick by the way um because it didn't like the dial a but and I didn't think it would hold up long term which it's turned out to be a bit problematic\nAnd I also think our safety and security on these machines to Saturday it's time for the county to step up and get new machine\nIt's like having rotary phones for for for the county for you know for emergency services for goodness sakes\nI'm for it begs the question of ballot integrity that's the real question here\nNancy's is noted that that the machines are untrustworthy that they are quirky that the software stinks I'm against like using windows three point one I'm In an era of you know when does it in those ten for God's sakes uh what about the advice of take your time\nI went in the best the best thing about these machines is that you get a final review of your ballot said before you hit that cast a ballot button you should read everything that it says you voted for him for that takes you a minute men\nAnd if you come across something that is not what you intended before you hit that cap spelled button you can ask for assistance from somebody Oh absolutely absolutely there and they'll help you to go back in and get to the point where you make\n... and it's not that hard to do the fun thing is the other thing is wait till twenty twenty when we no longer have straight ticket voting\nYeah [laughter] that's can be really come to\nTexas attorney general Ken Paxton has been ramping up voter fraud prosecutions recently why\nUh it's five days till election or sees me six days a lecture and among other things um it is also justification for voter id abusive voter id in the state of Texas\nRight because they'll have another challenge I'm voter id ah both court wise and in the legislature next session so he is collecting cases to prove they are actually is voter fraud in our environment\nIt's more of a case of of of a of the solution in search of a problem right thing\nState Sen Paul Bettencourt in Harris County clerk stand standard have accused tax is such a collector and Harris Bennett of ignoring Texas election law the charges stem from her rejection of four thousand voter registration challenges by GOP activist Allen veer earlier this year why did she rejected challenges\nVersions were actually filmed in Texas and surprisingly almost all of them were the only one that was not with the Texas Chainsaw massacres three D. was filmed in Canada [laughter] I Believe but the rest of them were found around Austin um round rock those kinds of things um [noise]\nSo so at least those I'm now I'm not saying texting them after is a great example of a horror movie it's just the one that comes to mind I guess [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nAnd then of course you've got planet terror which is part of the grind house thing in the Clinton turn to you know for a while he was really into filming movies in Texas so I mean I think it kind of have to bend the rules for that those those movies a little bit but they are considered horror films um maybe not complete ones [noise]\nYou're gonna miss if I told you you're probably not living [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] and\nThen one that I was really proud that I thought a because it's not the first thing you think of even the title might suggest that is a ghost story\nBy member you may be able to make sure you're around now\nMostly went into a ghost story which came out\nA couple of years ago thinking oh it's going to be a scary movie and it's by David Lowry who lives in Texas so that movie is not exactly what you think I mean there is a ghost there is a person wearing a sheet it's ah an artistic movie um and kind of caught people off guard but I Would include that went in there just because it's something completely\nDifferent let's start with the Texas Chainsaw massacre because if you say horror in Texas that's the first thing someone's going to think of Texas in the title I talk about the original ... the original Nineteen Seventy four movie you know it's bizarre it's gruesome it's it's a little bit upsetting well I think\nYou know if you think about how a film has evolved obviously and and and what we're what what's allowed on screen today has changed\nSo I think why that movie was so popular like I could give you an endless examples of movies today that come out that still shocked the audience and that's what was happening in Seventy four it was\nIt really was basically an independent movie that surprise people because they didn't have studio requirements saying you know you have to do this you have to get this you have to get a PG Thirteen writing\nAnd those are the types of movies not just Texas Chainsaw massacre button and all other horror movies that were coming out during that time period that we're breaking boundaries and doing things that other horror movies wasn't and I think that's why it became popular and banned in some areas because it was so graphic and violent\nAnd then like you said because Texas is in the title and because the original created such a stir it it was an incentive for studios\nTo keep reimagining that over and over and over for different generation to them and it was even surprising to me who I reviewed the modern versions and I was even shocked\nAt how many of these I've actually sit down to the um and just to build as the star of one of them met boomer was the star of one of them I mean we're ... another Texan and Matthew McConaughey another tax and they got their start in one of them many Texas Chainsaw massacre franchises I mean so it's even it's even spawned careers\nMhm something that we also sort of touched on in our conversations before was this idea of the rural setting you know Texas Chainsaw massacre it's kind of set in the middle of nowhere ... what is it about that rural southern us sort of setting that that makes such effect of horror well\nSo yeah maybe we can give Texas Chainsaw massacre a little bit of credit for starting that but I think that's a trend that really spread like wildfire and I mean that's really the setting in almost every single horror movie you know isolation is terrifying\nI I've always said in my reviews its really challenging or really impressive when a horror movie can scare you in daylight because most Mormons do you think they're isolated it's dark it's usually raining there is a storm or something\nSo yeah I mean it it certainly traits that fear but you know I think that's something that works for outside\nOf Texas because\nFor us living here in Houston and Galveston Dallas wherever the city\nWe don't necessarily think of Texas like that\nYou know so that is something that these movies are playing\nTo people that live outside the states that are not thinking about Texas has an urban community or you know full of huge cities like we're ... we know of it so so yeah I mean I I can see why that is appealing and\nAs far as ... films in Texas to be up some other uh examples you'd like to discuss okay so there are other movies that are filmed in Texas that can kinda\nStraddle the fence as far as horror goes\nOf them you could certainly make an argument that no country for old men has them horrific elements to it and now there are some that obviously went on to win best picture it by the Coen brothers\n[noise] off just [noise]\n\nYou know we're going for you\nCall it a chemical [noise]\nYou've been out of your whole life just do now that the\nWest Texas thing but I mean there's certainly some really really disturbing things in that movie nocturnal animals a recent one that Tom Ford shot in El Paso also west Texas with Jake Gyllenhaal Amy Adams army hammer is also\nI mean not only I didn't make sense when maybe thinking about going on lately recently\nYou just put pays for it [noise] [laughter] any dedicated to me so\nThat's another movie that I think that straddles the fence a poor has some horrific elements to it and very upsetting scary and then finally I just one of my favorite movies in general it's a cardio the drug cartel Emily blonde or the sequel just came out this year beneath you'll do thorough\n[noise] gone gone gone laugh [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nYou find yourself very scared in in films like that where you know they don't basically get tapped his heart and I think hard sometimes gets a bad rap because we think of it can't be labeled horror unless it's about a slasher killer or something like that but there's other horse scenarios that we can think of\nAnd then as you mentioned outside of Texas just some briefly I was trying to look in the south western eastern area one of my favorite films that I guess you would consider a horror movie will be the gift um the San ... version of the gift not the ... version\nWhich which swimming listen to me I'd been with me and said her the way and [noise]\nAll right [noise] I don't tell\nThe gift was a kind of a movie that slipped under the radar it was Cate Blanchett Hilary Swank Keanu Reeves Jk simmons now has an Oscar Katie Holmes I mean it was a huge cast rural setting it was ... in Georgia um I thought that was a really great film and then get out of course that we just saw last year that was shot in Alabama even though it wasn't set\n[noise] think before we were in a way [noise]\n\nI Want to kind of go back to it to where you were talking about with this idea that\nNATO horrors the same basically you know you talked about some of these movies\nStraddle line they they're not out right you know marketed as horror movies but they still have some of these pretty horrific elements in no country for old men has probably one of the most effective villains of of a film in a very long time and he compare him to a famous villain like leather face\nYeah first of all how the ... performance and that some not only made his career um he he was fantastic and you know you could easily ... you could put ... character in that next the heath Ledger's joker you could put that you know in the screen face all those guys\nAnd at the end of the day you have to ask yourself as a viewer what are you more terrified by are you more terrified by some unrealistic guy and a sheet\nThat is trying to kill people in the woods or a madman that is not interested in hiding his face because he's coming after you no matter what I mean like you said ... is way more terrifying if he really sit down and think about it than any of these supernatural killers\nSo I think that's what works for that film and I mean that's just a a a great film out even outside of the thrilling elements I mean what the Coen brothers did with that movie was pretty phenomenal and it still holds up today if you go back and watch it and it and that you know that the movie I think Texas can really be proud of\nSo so living in Texas in thinking about the horror genre are there opportunities for something new is there some creative vein that could be used for ineffective\nHorror film absolutely and before I can answer that I must say because I Would be terrible if I didn't mention the fact that the reason that so many of these films are not shot in Texas I mean for instance like hell or high water the Jeff Bridges amazing and that was nominated for best picture\nTwo years ago that some couldn't even be shot in Texas because Texas does not offer incentives for filmmakers\nSo that is a big road blocks for all these films even if they're set in Texas they have to go swimming Utah or in Mexico or somewhere else in a state that will offer them as tax incentives", "show_name": "Houston Matters",
