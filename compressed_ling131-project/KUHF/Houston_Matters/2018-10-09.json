know he moved and three or four months ago they say that the the houses did not far during Harvey that's just great hopefully they don't fund the future the buyers right over the fence\nLet me talk about risk or we're not just talking about homebuyers fight we're also talking about perhaps developers do they run the financial risk that if they dealt in these areas that necessarily that doesn't mean that home buyers are going to come by in this area\nI mean that that's true in theory but I think we've seen in practice that buyers are willing to accept that risk to it where they want to live um and that's that's why are we see development being added now and you know town homes and the three or four or five hundred thousand dollar ... and the and the floodplain\nYeah I mean it related right when developers built into the floodplains they're only risk is really comes to do people by the homes and then once people buy homes that people who are taking on the ... the homeowner and the federal taxpayers to the national flood insurance program\nAnd the national flood insurance program to put it bluntly is fairly broken it doesn't work very well I'm In the least and it comes to discouraging development floodplain areas or encouraging people not to live in those areas um if developing as occurred\nSo you get subsidized flood insurance you pay you for subsidized insurance the flood you'd do what we were talking about earlier you do whatever you need to do to staying home if that's what you want to do and when you fight again you ... you know the federal government will pay it out again you can rebuild and you can go over and over and over again\nAnd that's yeah that's that's so true and the the other point to make on that is yeah I mean I talked to a few realtors for this story who ah were frankly not comfortable with the sort of attitude that they're going from their buyers they have some buyers\nThey said don't tell me anything that flooded but a majority of the buyers that several ... set or they're working with if they see something they like they buy it like well I'm going to buy flood insurance I'll be covered and I'm getting a great deal in this house 'cause that's what\nOn the other day or two there's a whole bunch of people who aren't buying homes right they're not buying developed comes they're buying homes that are already in the fall I planted a flooded and they're renting homes that have been taught by investors that they knew were flooded already and again they don't take on the rest they put that risk onto the adventures and that makes it a exceedingly difficult people choose to live in these areas\nNot because they're very happy to live in a flooded home or home that is flooded in many cases they're choosing to live in these areas are by our rent these flooded homes because it's in a good school district and it's the prices might be cheaper now that it flooded there's a lot of perverse incentives where it encourages people to live in places where they might not choose to otherwise\nThat's Matt Dempsey he's data editor for the Houston Chronicle we also heard Mike Morris city hall reporter for the chronicle they spoke of

southwest\nYou noted that ah your family maybe potentially is connected to this converse of population\nMy father's maternal grandfather was I'm Jay too I and what what is Jay to me I think\nA lot one let me let me turn back Greenspan to explain that well Jake too is a branch of the tree of mankind found in males and uh and these branches have geographical specificity Jake to was from the northern part of the fertile crescent\nOkay and so they need to explain that a little bit when so so the fertile crescent as an area that the ah that that the original he Bruce who became Jews\nCame out of its day populated primarily by either a Christian Arabs or Muslim Arabs but there were Jews there two thousand years ago and so when we find people in the Hispanic world who are J. one\nSouthern fertile crescent or J. to northern fertile crescent the likelihood that they have a connection to to ah Jews is pretty good and it's one hundred percent certain that they are either part of the Jewish diaspora or part of the Muslim expansion which started after the advent of Islam\nSo Dr Hernandez what's the lesson you take away from this about our expectations are definitions about race ethnicity religion these things that that we all used to define who we are\nI think the point is that and many people might disagree with me but race is socially constructed\nAnd ethnicity is socially constructed it's your identity is what you think you are and what other people think you are so there's\nTwo different ways of looking at it and the secret Jew issue I did of identity is rather controversial because there are some groups that say just because your great great great grandmother was doesn't mean you are\nAnd and the people that are very emotionally invested get upset and say no that's that's right that's what I Believe I Am so there is some tension there\nHave a problem so I Would think that the what part of life African\nPercentage was the dominant well the ancestors had didn't get the range from the euro somebody that Britain that Congo and it you know then I go whatever couldn't be accurate ... percent solid way that\nI don't see that in like an eye care look but I thought how could you be so accurate on though the person that they're not or an accurate but like\nAll right thanks for the call and for the question well first of all I I Want to tell you that the that the situation you're talking about as it relates to Africa will eventually self correct Africa is just under samples and when you're under sampled a you can tend to get some ... ...\nAnd seeing a results or results that don't have a very very high confidence level on the other hand uh my guess is that the uh European countries are for all of U.S companies that do these percentage tests are quite\n[noise] quite well sampled and therefore I think that there's a good reason for you to believe that uh that at minimum Fifteen Percent of your DNA comes from northern European populations I I\nGuess one thing I Want to come back to the sort of wrap this up is that we heard that caller suggested you know she doesn't believe that or feel that your ... she was comfortable with the identity that she\nHas lived her life as so is it okay to simply say All right well this may be what the genetic say but that doesn't necessarily control or impact who I represent myself to be in the world\nWell it goes back to the identity issues that she is who she believes she is and there has been some question about people if they find Fifteen Percent Swedish does that mean they need to start thinking about being Swedish or likes Swedish music art and and it's really not about that is about how they feel who they are\nHouston's archeology now hosts couldn't versus a secret passed as a

College of veterinary medicine just started two weeks ago I Am still working a Saturday here and there at my early in the animal comic um 'cause I Love the people there and the patients that I see\n'em so it's all like fighting and fine and getting into a whole new environment\nCongratulations ... if we walk him any questions you have about the dog or cat companion and your life\nAt seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can email us at talk it's used in matters dot org a couple of things you want to get to before we get to those questions October is adopt a dog month this is according to the American humane association also adopt a sheltered dog my specifically for the SPCA\nAlright make your case why should someone who doesn't have a dog or can accommodate another dog adopt one the smoke\nBecause dogs are awesome um I Would just can't imagine living without a dog um but they're proven health benefits to dog ownership as we know it lessens the risk of cardiovascular disease or is actually a recent study that showed even people who already had a heart attack or have cardiovascular disease\nAnd will lessen the risk of an Ayn other cardiovascular incident and we know it lowers blood pressure and another thing that's recently getting more and more press is loneliness ah loneliness being chronically lonely can shape seven or eight years off your life\nAnd when you consider that the fastest growing segment of our population is people over the age of eighty five um who are also often feeling lonely I'm having a dog can do so much to alleviate that\nAre there some questions or you should ask before adopting a dog musher\nI'm One are you capable of taking care of it do you have the space for it can you provide the exercise needed I can you cover the the basic supplies veterinary care and things like that um so it's certainly you need to be equipped to have a\nDog how about the time I'm On one of the you know I grew up with dogs ... I Love dogs I don't have a dog now we need to talk well we've been talking about but one of the reasons why is the combination of long commute and Germans long work days I I don't feel right about leaving a dog alone at home for so many hours\nRight and that's that that is definitely fair because dogs are people please there's um so there are certainly ways to have a dog even when you have long hours you need to be very careful of the breed that you get a getting a border collie or retriever or something that's high energy and he talks a lot of exercise would not be appropriate\nBut if you get an older dog that's already of a low energy breed that only needs\nShort walks in the morning before you do and when you get home in the evening then that's certainly possible and if you think a dog isn't going to do it there there's lots of other species out their cats rabbits all sorts of things that still give you the benefit to pet ownership\nWe get to some questions let's do it let's start with an email from Tim who says I have a Fifteen year old Beagle that seems to have lost her ability to hold her pee through the night so she ...\nUp which me up at least once in the middle of every night is there any supplement or food change I can try anything else I can do I haven't slept through the night in the year oh wow\nI'm yeah that's a lot of sleep so certainly the first thing I Would do is have your dog evaluated for an underlying medical condition a kidney disease can certainly make it harder because the urine is dilute and so if you can't concentrate your during your Blatter's can still more quickly\nAnd so we for dog does have kidney disease there are things that can be done for that uh we also want to rule out a bladder infection that could be causing a problem so that is certainly were I Would start um is with a full medical work up to make sure there's not an underlying medical condition that needs to be corrected\nLet's take a call we're Boston on the line from the woodland Austin what's your question for Dr ...\nAre you good so you're a they've been getting a ... yard you know dark they've hired four and a window or walk\nTo the way they die

she's not\nGoing to be right there yeah that's a very good care right I've never seen anything like\nOh yeah that I mean that's really rough um that's going to be a long term issue um that's going to require a lot of patience on your parents' part I'm of course on the dog's part and I would recommend\nTalking to their veterinarian one about some medication um to help deal with the anxiety component of it but this particular dog may even need some intervention from a veterinary behaviorist\nUm if it's to the point where the dog is actually screaming and crying and that scared\nA because that that's truly traumatic it's almost like a pie TST kind of thing for the dog and I don't think there's anything your parents are really going to be able to do on their own um at least easily

which is sort of above plus seven Trump district has probably in play in this case it seems\nLike it's not this is Dan Patrick's old district which Betancourt has won by better than Seventy percent in the moments that he's run the challenger here is David Romero who is raised very little money less than five thousand dollars and his running on a fairly generic\nPlatform he does include a among the things he talks about a flooding and\nFlood prevention so that's something that may get some residents in that district which was hit heavy by some of the release of the reservoirs after Harvey\nState Senate district Seventeen brand and features incumbent Joan Huffman facing challenger ... which we know about this district in that race\nI like is this race because I think it's a a matchup that Democrats can potentially when this was shaped like an upside down shrimp which makes sense because the district runs from basically Freeport Lake Jackson area all the way up through sugar land that kind of hooks Belair\nUm the incumbent is John Hoffman and the challenger ... the Democrat this is a marginally Trump district by about plus one\nI'm the only issue is that other statewide officials did much better than Trump in this district so when Christian who was a a more or less generic Republican running statewide rare automation got fifty two percent or ... for the Supreme Court got fifty five percent\nWhat do you mean that you should spend his life in service of other people's joy was I mean\nWell I mean I think because he's taken so much joy out of the world\nThat a more appropriate I for it and I would be to put that joy back in that to me a better as sort of sense of symmetry and um I don't necessarily know what that looks like and I don't necessarily think it's my job to decide for him what happens to him\nBut I also think that we put too much emphasis on what happens to the person who causes the harm rather than on the person who experience is it because you know in this case you know there's still an active um pursuit of him they're trying to extradite him eventually maybe if they ever catch him and bring it back\nTo the United states there'll be a trial and all that that sense of justice is placed on what happens to him rather than on what happens to me and the ways that I find healing and I'm much more interested in what happens to victims and defining justice in a way\nIf an injustice is anything that gets between us that our capacity for joy perhaps justice is anything that makes the condition of joy of possibility I get\nA lot of your writing the other soldiers said was about changing your relationship with the story of what had happened to you because you put so much time living in fear or she would the books should have you back on little round so to speak and then this one seems more boat you know trying to move forward now\nSure I think the other side was very much a question for me to change my relationship to the past to change my relationship to this one really really traumatic memory and um to change my brain and certain way so that I wasn't\nFeeling like I was still inside this trauma that was happening that I could in fact realized that that story was over and that I I could start a new one\nUm and this book takes up where that left off of okay if that story is about over what is the new one look like for me\nAnd of course it does deal with my own experience of injustice but also it deals with um the injustice that eye witness\nEveryday ecological disaster racial violence sexual violence beyond just what I've experienced\nAs well as you know mass shootings there's a way in which the way that we understand justice on a personal level certainly applies to the way that we understand justice on a public a political a social and world level\nIt was going to ask you how you're everything we've seen in recent years maybe even even greater national conversation about justice police shooting ... that sort of thing how those conversations changed how you think about justice and how was your experience do you think change do you see just as in those cases\nI think you know if we take that Kavanaugh hearings where someone professor Buffy Ford accused a powerful man Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nAnd she was heard she was brought to the hearing but there was a way in which all at the same\nWays that we have typically discredited survivors um we saw played out again in many ways in real time and when Brett Kavanaugh than you know sat down at the table and began his testimony\nI think we saw a way in which what's at stake here is not even necessarily just a seat on the Supreme Court but the power to define what is real\nAnd that he was forceful and loud and adamant that his experience with real and professor of law the Ford was timid and vulnerable and also insistent that her experience with real but for some reason\nYou know sexual assault is the only crime that we have in our society where the victim is subject and subjected to doubt\nYou know when there's a murder we have a dead body and so there's no doubt that it occurred and if an eye witness says I saw someone murder that person that person's witness counts as evidence in the trial\nBut in terms of sexual assault a woman's own witness or what has happened to her doesn't count in the same way\nAnd so I think in this situation justice looks like us listening to women talk about their lives and believing them and taking women's word as an expression\nA description of reality rather than as a fantasy or as an imagination or has some sort of hysterical conspiracy theory right\nAnd I think you know it doesn't necessarily look like him being punished but also not getting a promotion isn't punishment that's just not getting a promotion\nDuring oldest we heard a lot of people men probably saying things like war union woman could make accusations and ruin a man's life without any proof measuring how did you respond when he does things like that\n[noise] um I spend a lotta time granting my teeth in my late it's very frustrating because I think\nThere have been other historical moments when there's a moment of reckoning with the epidemic of sexual violence against women\nAnd every time it seemed to be transformed\nFrom an epidemic of sexual violence when women are talking about the reality but they're experienced and people are realizing that it's not just one woman or two women that is a widespread thing and that I think it's so hard for people to wrap their heads around\nThat it's much easier to believe that in fact we are having an epidemic a false allegations against men\n[noise] um but in and as I said before it seems to be a question of the power to define what is real\nThat women are talking about the reality of their life this violence that we've experienced that so many women have experienced and people are saying you're making this up or your you must be making this up because this can't possibly be real\nAnd I think it's easier it's more comfortable for men and women to believe that\nThe case rather than to understand the ways that this touches every sphere of society and perhaps even reaches into their very own family that's an uncomfortable a very uncomfortable idea to grapple with and so it's easier to just dismiss it and say that it it can't possibly exist\n[noise] the ... and Michael harder to be talking with writer ... junction shoes a domestic abuse survivor and author of several books including the other side and now a collection of stories about justice told the Russians\nShow [noise] can you or other people who've been through something like you have can you get back what you lost what was taken from you and what you went through\n[noise] I don't think so I don't think that that brings up a question of um of recovery I really dislike the idea of recovery\nBecause the recovery implies just at that there's a way somehow to go back to being what I was before or become re becoming a woman who had never been kidnapped and raped by a man that she locked well there's something wrong with you know right there is nothing wrong with me now\nAnd I'm also it's just impossible to re become that person\nAnd instead what I have focused on is how do I accept this how do I move through this and how do I use this from this\nThis memory of the worst thing that ever happened to me in my entire life and from that draw power and strength to speak truth to power to advocate for other women to use that strength and power to\nBear witness to other forms of violence that are occurring all around us all the time\nBefore you wrote this book or years before did you was there a period in your life where you did want something bad quote unquote to happen to your your attract or\nI don't think so I think there may have been a time when I imagine having to shoot him say that that always came from a since then I might have to defend myself at some point that he would eventually come back to try to kill me and I would have to defend myself\nBut I never wanted him to be killed or to be harmed I don't necessarily not want him to face consequences I'm not suggesting that there should be no consequences for his behavior\nBut rather the thing that I Need is not his suffering but again his acknowledgement of all the things that he did to me and the ways that they have cause me harm and pain and sorrow and that's the thing that I Want from in instead of\nWitnessing his pain\nHow did you get to the police or to do just always going to know that ultimately that was going to be bad for you\nI because I don't hate him and I've never I hated him and I think in order to want that for another person you have to hate them\nAnd that is everything that we were told about what justice is is that to find pleasure in watching another person be killed it requires that you hate that person\nAnd I don't hate him I don't\nHate anyone I Try to think of everyone or regard everyone let's say from a place of love and I don't mean romantic love I don't have romantic love for this person but I have love for his humanity in the world and knowledge that he's a human\nAnd that even though he did this terrible thing to me he is more than the sum of the worst things he's ever done he has some one son and someone's brother and many people's parent and um I think that\nThe predominant reaction among most people was we have to restrict these crazy drivers and their machines\nSee before cars came along our streets were really different they were full of people walking playing biking riding horses pushing carts getting on and off street cars and they were all jostling for the same space in a kind of chaotic ballet\nBut didn't cars came along their big fast they're made of metal and who are killing people by the thousand\nOr does matter last more [noise]\nYou have the day was filled with reasonably story crashes and\nCartoons of evil drivers depicted as grim reaper Z but then things changed car proponents campaigned\nTo shift the conversation from deadly drivers to careless pedestrians it was the beginning of jaywalking\nJay in old saying was a foolish person from the country we would call them a hit gets an offensive term\nThe English to shame pedestrians for walking into the streets which the automobile backers wanting cars to own one of the first cities to make Jay walking a crime\nWas Los Angeles by the Nineteen twenties the fast growing city had one of the highest car ownership rates in the country and drivers we'll do their influence through the powerful auto club yeah the same when you call to junk your car battery\nRepresented the motorists in\nWant it to make sure that the streets were safe and that everyone knew what to do\nMatthew ... is the group's historian he says the club did much more than ... lost to discourage jaywalking\nEverything from signs to landmarks to traffic signals all of these common sense rules\nHas to be derived and then disseminated and then in force\nThe auto club worked hand in hand with the city to do that and turn the street in front of their historic headquarters south of downtown into kind of testing ground for new ideas like what is the first traffic signals\nYou had a concrete base and Rosa fourteen feet\nWith signals to go or stop\nStanding at that intersection today you can see the legacy those efforts\nA street that is much more order than the old days but also more dominated by cars Norton the historian says that may not last\nThe victory of automobiles in the Nineteen twenties is proof that what streets are for can be changed innovation he says is a powerful force the popularity of scooter and it was actually I think pretty good evidence that people are looking for something different\nAnd if we in two thousand Eighteen take the same kind of approach\nOf reexamining our laws are social norms and our infrastructure we can reinvent streets again and there's no reason why we shouldn't\nLike it or not he scooters could someday become just another part of our streets gate in Los Angeles and Megan McCarthy Reno for marketplace [noise]\n\n\n\nJust followed all the way up to do some economic inside perhaps into the big none economic story of the day Nikki
