four four zero eighty eight Seventy or at talk at Houston matters dot org you can reach out to us on Facebook or Twitter at Houston matters\nA first just gives sort of a way of the land how large of a Jewish community do we have here compared to other cities is it a significant community here\nThe Jewish community here in Houston in the fourth largest city in America is a very significant Jewish community there is some demographic study from two thousand sixteen we believe about Fifteen fifty six thousand Jews living in the community it's a very close knit Jewish community that works well together um\nIt takes a large intermediate size Jewish community where\nEvery single type of service and institutions very vibrant community and as a newcomer to Houston I moved here a year ago I say it's one of the best kept secrets\nBoth the city itself and I think the Jewish community to understand that it really provides everything that someone would need to live a meaningful purposeful vibrant Jewish life\nOr not in significant chunk of that fifty six thousand or so a live in ... pretty close geographic proximity to what other are certainly have over multiple generations I mentioned Meyer land in Bel Air Maryland in particular\nIs as long as you know a pretty significant Jewish population is that changing\nSo the hub of Jewish life is built around them Ireland ... air area as he referenced\nAnd we also found when we did the demographic study and twenty sixteen that the community is spreading out\nYoung families are moving to the heights and Montrose and Katie and sugar land and so one of the things we were looking at even before Hurricane Harvey is the ten court or and how do we provide services to the Jewish community where they live outside the walls of institutions\nAnd at the same time we still see\nA very central hub of Jewish life even after Harvey a lot of people are staying in the ... in Bel Air area\nThat said there has been this shift to some degree or and was before Harvey and now since Harvey and again as I noted Marlins among those communities that got battered by flooding three years in a row\nOf are we seeing that exacerbated now is that the shift to people's during to leave that are a little more than than we saw prior to harvest\nThe Jewish tradition of greater Houston has done a lot of work in the last year both in the media recovery but then also to look at the resiliency for the future so one thing to first understand is that the majority of the clients that we are serving the Jewish families are partner Jewish family service\nTheir families that they are seen the majority of them are first time flooded families and so different people flooded in\nYou know the three floods people that thread that flood it three times some are moving but a lot of the people who flooded for the first time in the wake of Harvey are staying and saying this was you know\nA once hopefully in a lifetime situation but we do know there will be continued flooding and so what the Jewish Federation has done\nPost the immediate recovery needs and raising twenty two million dollars is we've focused on resiliency and so we've put together a taskforce with leadership\nThat has a flood resiliency taskforce and it was put together with three key areas to focus on the Justin equitable allocation of recovery funds for the families and institutions that we're most hard hit were working at the\nCounty city um national and you know state levels are looking at government funding\nWe're also looking at this is the third five hundred year flood as you referenced so we're looking at the prevention of this central character of the Jewish community in this Milan and mid raised by Larry and how do we keep that\nAnd then the third piece is that we're making sure that the Jewish communities voice is heard to focus on a purposeful redesign and we worked with University of Houston and Rice University to focus on this mile and a greater Maryland area\nTo figure out how to mitigate flooding for the future\nAnd and what have you determine so far what what needs to change a force that community in particular that geographic area to be more resilient so and when it comes to future flooding fresh\nFor the first thing is we all know it's very complicated building these long term relationships with the public and elected officials were actually doing an event at\nThe Jaycee on Sunday October twenty eighth that is focusing on recovery and rebelled we're having a panel discussion that haven't been to the Houston Chronicle is moderating and judge at em it will be speaking as well as our own director of Harvey recovery um\nAnd also somebody from the flood Harris County flood control and so we've learned it's very complicated where you know that we need to continue to advocate and work in partnership with the elected officials\nAre the work that's being done right now along raised by which we see every single day when we drive\nUp and down bracelet we know that was should've been done many years ago and has nothing to do with Harvey and so I think\nMost importantly we want to make sure that the recovery funds that are coming to this area we focused a lot leading up to the bond vote to get the Jewish community and others to get out to vote and to vote in favor of it and now to hold the elected officials accountable where those resources going and make sure that\nOur community that was so hard hit both the Jewish community and others that live in the area a receive the funding that is needed to focus on\nThe detention and retention sites and to make sure that we are focused on resiliency unfortunately flooding probably will happen again uh the reality is we just need to be prepared\nYou mentioned raise word or by drive up and down raised with all the time and have seen a lot of those\nSigns in front of houses some of them for sale others saying oh you know this whole are raised by you know wrote us in such company demonstrating that they've lifted the house or\nOr you know flooding repairs done or or signs that say never flooded you name it but there does seem to be a lot of that to suggest that there were some people\nWould come to the conclusion that in some cases maybe they've lived there two three generations but maybe it's time to move on does it change the identity of the neighborhood itself if you start to see even just a few folks move away\nWhat we've seen is that the community was already starting to spread out a little bit for Houston Jewish community has been very lucky that much of it has provoked often stayed in one kind of area\nBut we also have a number of Jews living throughout Houston and if they've as we know large sprawling city\nSo we've talked a lot with real estate agents figuring out what's actually happening\nMany people are staying the we're very concerned about the young families what we've seen is that\nThe empty nesters who were maybe thinking at some point in their retirement they're going to move out of the area and to a high rise living\nIf they flooded and Harvey it may have perpetuated that even quicker that they're moving out but the young families who have kids in school who are going to the synagogues to the Jaycee and utilizing the services in that area many of them are staying\nA but we have to think about\nYoung couples that are buying homes who don't have kids yet you know we worked with a family who flooded they were pregnant during Harvey they were living in a house they thought was their dream house always envisioned up sending their kids to Jewish day school in the area\nAnd after they flooded the realize you know we're going to move out of this area but for everyone that's moving out there is five and ten more that we talked to that are staying that are either raising their home rebuilding same we've only flooded ones and so\nWe both have to look at the changing\nRealities of the world we live in in the sprawling world we live in how to provide services outside the walls but that's something that we knew before Harvey but much of the community is also staying in that area\n[noise] how long do you think it might take to fully recover from all the issues is that Harvey has raised for the Jewish community in Britain used\nWe've been really fortunate at the federation that were part of all larger national system and the federation ... from around the country and Jewish federations of North America have been here many times have given us advice and so the New York federation\nIn the wake of Superstorm Sandy ... told us that it took them five years to close their last case so we are planning for\nThree to five year period um we're looking at what we still need to fund a over the next three to four years\nAnd unfortunately what happens now is that the families that need help the cases are even more difficult now and they were initially because these are families that\nAre dealing with the TST that maybe thought initially they had the resources they've never isn't that wants to give they've never needed help and then they tried for a year\nTo make this work in only now are starting to realize that they need the help of caseworkers I'm from our partner at chess and so we're looking at recovery for families and individuals for the next three or four years\nWhen you're a kid growing up\nHe thought you were the only kid who was being raised by grandparents and who had a parent who was addicted and now you know that this is such an epidemic there's so many parents who have addiction problems and there's so many grandparents raising children um\nIt doesn't make you feel less alone can now and I offer more responsible for it\nYour story but they do you feel like oh yeah\nI feel both I feel I feel that responsibility and I do feel less alone because it's not just kids too I mean there are other people my age or younger or older who will pull me aside and say oh we we had this in my family too and I have come to recognize the looks\nThat that people will give me right before they are about to share information for me with me and and that typically happens now with a book signing\nWhere a similar come up with her book\nAnd they'll explain who this book is four and there'll be overcome with emotion\nAnd and I'm and I'm there for that and and present for that and you know they they they they give me this grief and I am and I'm able to compartmentalize it and leave it there at the at the

other organizations that we work with feel the same way as we do but this is completely and totally unnecessary\nAnd the the people that are here are not burden to society which is completely wrong they're here they're productive citizens they're working they don't have health insurance and they they need access to health care\nAnd by threatening to withhold their citizenship which is something they want or threatening to not renew their green card to me it's cool it's\nCompletely and totally unnecessary\nWhen you talk about patients who are concerned or are hesitant to use the resources hearing in Harris community or the greater Houston region it what ... are kind of the immediate effects that you're seeing since this rule was proposed a just a few weeks ago\nIn the long term people will get sicker and they will end up going to the emergency room which is far more expensive care than it would be to get their preventive care so they'll be much greater financial burden on us the tax payers\nBecause they still do not have health insurance and they'll be so much sicker and costs so much more than if they would and should do what they're doing now which is come in for their preventive care and their routine care\nAccess to their medication et cetera and the much more cost effective to do it that way than if they go to the emergency room\nHow has a legacy community health mobilized in terms of informing your employees your staff of how to communicate with patients and other community members about what this new rule means a on a very practical and very real level\nWe have provided education sessions for or staff in particular are providers doctors nurse practitioner social workers to talk with patients about that coming to legacy is not a threat these are not going to count against them their routine because if they come to us\nAnd to really talk to them to try to dispel their fear um a lot of this is the or more fear than reality\nIf this rule does go through how would you argue this rule could affect Houston in particular\nThat will have a chilling effect on people who are here legally\nBlonde accessing preventive care and it will cause a burden on the tax payers because again they will not access preventive care access through medications\nUntil they're really really sick and end up either being transported by ambulance to the emergency room or so sick they'll end up in the emergency room on their own\nSince the department of homeland security already has this proposed rule published in the federal registrar that means that we're in the midst of the sixty day public review period in which the public can comment on the proposal but in particular with this meeting in Washington what's just follow up from your and\nWe will be commenting on the rule through the appropriate channels and we will continue to meet with lawmakers and urged them to not allowed Israel to go into effect\nThat's Katy Caldwell CEOs legacy community help she spoke of Houston matters Maggie Martin this morning the Kaiser Family foundation has done research on the potential impacts of this proposed rule Smith or she goes director of the disparities Policy Project at the Kaiser Family foundation she tells Maggie Martin what those effects are\nThere really are two primary impacts that we've highlighted in our analysis of the proposed rule\nThe first is that it would make it harder for individuals with lower incomes health conditions lower education levels or who use or are likely to use\nCertain health nutrition and housing programs including Medicaid to get a green card because da chest would consider these to be negative characteristics in public charge determinations under the proposed rule\nThe second major impact that we've been highlighting is that the proposed rule could lead to decrease participation in public programs broadly among immigrant families and recent research and previous experience suggests that he's just a moment effects\nCould extend broadly across immigrant families and their citizen children beyond those who are directly affected by the rule\nYou know let's talk more about that particular affect how do we know this\nThis chilling effect that would probably touch immigrant families we know about from recent research we've done speaking with families and as well as previous experience with changes in eligibility roles in the past\n[noise] so what this chilling effect assumes is that families might feel increased fear and confusion from the rule and not understand the details of the rural and feel that they're safe option is just to avoid using public programs\nIn recent interviews we've done with immigrant families before that propose role was even announced\nWe had heard these feelings that increased fear and uncertainty and uh that was leading to some families to turn away from using programs and services for themselves and I'm In some cases their children and then if we look back to the Nineteen nineties\nWhen welfare reform changed eligibility roles for public programs for some immigrants\nThe research based on that experience showed that there were brought declines and enrollment in public programs among immigrant families and their children\nAnd that does declines we're seeing among uh individuals and children who were not directly affected by those eligibility role changes again stemming from confusion and fear\nThere isn't an argument that some groups have made with regards to that effect and that it leads to in the long term people getting sicker because they're not seeking out\nCare because of the fact that you're speaking to a which then leads to them are going to the ER and leading to actually higher costs for taxpayers is that something you can speak to and in terms\nOf either historical context or ... or something that we can look at today and say you know that it's okay that could potentially happen\nImmigrant family in turn away from public programs and enroll themselves and their children from programs like Medicaid and ship because it here and confusion what we would have would be increases and the number of uninsured and communities\nAnd what we know from research about being uninsured is that when you lack coverage you are less likely to on you care and it's reduced access\nTo care contributes to worth health outcomes\nPeople without coverage are at increased risk of delaying and going without needed care\nWhich can contribute ten more costly conditions in a long time we often that losses in coverage will translate into last rather than as an increase uncompensated care providers particularly safety net providers like community health centers\nAnd hospitals who would be serving that increased number of uninsured patients\nThat was Samantha Archie go director of the disparities Policy Project at the Kaiser Family foundation she spoke of Houston matters Mackey Martin this morning [noise]\nJust ahead

discussing issues of significance leading up to the mid term elections we've talked about political strategy and the balance of power and local state and federal government but there are more basic questions that need answering before you vote like\nWhere's your polling place can you vote there during early voting what sort of ID do you need\nDeeply developed farm systems and I guess branch Rickey was one of the the early developers of that concept but when you go back to the earliest days of Houston baseball word teams like the Buffalo's affiliated with any other teams or any other leagues\nIt's possible that the Buffalo's were the first real farm team in America or anywhere for that matter [noise] we're not exactly sure but branch Rickey is the guy that really settled at up he was the general manager of the cardinals and we're talking immediately following World War one\nAnd the national association that ran major league baseball did not allow a farm teams they did not want to major league team owning a minor league team the Texas League also did not want to major league team owning the effects of lake team\nAnd branch Rickey was doing all this under the table and even after the national association made it legal the Texas leagues still had an illegal so he's doing this on the sly or he had straw owners if you will here in Houston a John ... was a friend of his that started a quicker Fulbright Jaworski that a law firm\nAnd um so he's kind of overseeing the team for branch Rickey and the cardinals and it finally all came out uh in the early twenties\nAnd the Buffalo's went to the Texas League and said hey\nWe're sorry but in return for building a brand new stadium will let the cardinals continue to own us what do you think about that ... said fine [laughter] of Houston got a brand new stadium and it turned out that the Fort Worth cats had been operating under a similar situation and we are just right tigers and writing yeah\nIt it's amazing how rules are sacrosanct until well suddenly there's a new stadium involved exact [laughter]\nAh this actually takes us right to a question I had four year which is about notable players for the Buffalo's over the years if the Buffalo's were a part of that farm system that early farm system the cardinals the first name that comes to mind for me it usually always comes to mind for me when we talk about baseball standing usual\nMutual never played here although he had ties to Houston ... friendships long term friendships with different people er Dickie Kerr a is one of them and he was a guy you think back to the Nineteen Nineteen black Sox are ... the guy that did not take money are among the pictures\nOh right that was one of the game what was going to say he was the one that sort of kept them in it yeah young pitcher at the time\nWas an absolutely and he ended up living in Houston for a long time and there was even a statue of him that are still around at floating around I think last I heard uh skaters might have had it out in a sugar land but I'm not sure where it is now\nBut he became very good friends with a mutual so there were ties to Houston a dizzy dean is without a doubt the most famous guy that ever played for the ...\nHe was here for about a year and a half and I think it's impossible to say that anybody in the history of Houston sports ever caught the imagination of the town or than dizzy dean did\nTo give you an idea when he got married which was here in Houston or they did it at buffs stadium at home plate\nUm ballplayers with bats like a like sword yeah like sort of love them that they would walk through exactly course I'm his grooms men and a best man where the three sports editors from the major newspapers that's how much they love dizzy dean because he was an endless source a copy\nAnd just to give people a sense when you say and then the sorts of ... what kind of a personality was he\nThe guy was just bigger than life is a phrase that gets overused a lot but he really was they played afternoon games usually start around three o'clock sometimes he'd show up at two you know we're two thirty right before the game of starting and go out there and throw a three hitter a complete game\nUm he just seemed to dominate everybody up but he also had this incredible sense of humor he was\nConstantly going out and spend the money is very generous he would hit up the cardinals ball club for advances on his salary he was playing I think it was in Fort Worth as a matter of fact\nHe's playing one time and he's having a pretty good game he hit a home run and that was the only run and then he got into trouble\nThey fell behind in the manager comes out to pull dizzy dean and instead of walking toward the dugout he walks out to the outfield goes up to that hand operated stadium and pulls the one that represents his home run off of the scoreboard and he says if I'm going to my home runs coming with [noise]\nThe bus played at ... stadium what can you tell us about that ballpark\nThere was actually three places that the bus played um the first one was that ... a gallon and then in Nineteen oh five they moved to west in park which is underneath appears elevated right now and then in Nineteen twenty seven\nUm they moved over at the end of that season to bug stadium which is just a few blocks from where we are on the other side of the Gulf freeway\nA big ballpark a interestingly enough center field was for thirty six I think which is about exactly what minute maid was to centerfield when it opened up\nAt my right to say that was the site of the first major league night game\nNo oh no major league they would have been in the Texas legal in the Texas um and it wasn't the first it was very early I'm actually the first night games were with portable whites and other Kansas City monarchs which was a a negro league team were the first ones to travel around and bring their lights with them so they claim night games\nBut in case nobody's noticed as it gets really hot here\nAnd so the idea of playing games at nighttime instead of at three in the afternoon\nEverybody in the Texas League with I think maybe one exception of embrace night games before the major leagues did\nYou mentioned the negro leagues before the major leagues were integrated were their negro league teams here in Houston or did they play here for ...\nThere was a negro league team here what the national press refers to as the negro leagues is the negro National League and what was called the eastern colored league that later became the negro American League\nAnd they're all in the mid west and the northeast and after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball a major league baseball the negro leagues started very rapidly going downhill and the Newark Eagles that had been one of the main stays in the eastern league\nThey were losing money and so they got sold they played here for two seasons\nAnd the leading many nations stopping to worry that the city is eating more and more like a scene pug\nIf we do find the solution is going to go to obey obey much will be chill out a seat visit with them beautiful mountain most a
