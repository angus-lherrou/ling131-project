chance to do that right now there from ... what what are some of the potential links you are ... and we know them\nA first just give sort of a way of the land how large of a Jewish community we have here compared to other cities is it a significant community here\nThe Jewish community here in Houston and the fourth largest city in America is a very significant Jewish community there's some demographic study from two thousand sixteen we believe about Fifteen fifty six thousand Jews living in the community it's a very close knit Jewish community that works well together um\nIt's a it's a large intermediate size Jewish community with\nEvery single type of service and institutions very vibrant community and as a newcomer to Houston I moved here a year ago\nI say it's one of the best kept secrets both the city itself and I think the Jewish community to understand that it really provides everything that someone would need to live a meaningful purposeful vibrant Jewish life\nOr not in significant chunk of that fifty six thousand or so a live in ... pretty close geographic proximity to one another or certainly have over multiple generations or I mentioned Meyer land in Bel Air Maryland in particular\nIs as long as you know a pretty significant Jewish population is that changing\nSo the hub of Jewish life is built around them Ireland fell area air area as he referenced\nAnd we also found when we did the demographic studying twenty sixteen that the community is spreading out\nYoung families are moving to the heights and Montrose and Katie and sugar land and so one of the things we were looking at even before Hurricane Harvey is the ten court or and how do we provide services to the Jewish community where they live outside the walls of institutions\nAnd at the same time we still see\nA very central hub of Jewish life even after Harvey a lot of people are staying in the ... in Bel Air area\nThat said there has been this shift to some degree a and was before Harvey and now since Harvey and again as I noted Marlins among those communities that got battered by flooding three years in a row\nOf are we seeing that exacerbated now is that the shift to people starting to leave that are a little more than than we saw prior to harvest\nThe Jewish tradition of greater Houston has done a lot of work in the last year both when the media recovery but then also to look at the resiliency for the future so one thing to first understand is that the majority of the clients that we are serving the Jewish families are partner Jewish family service\nTheir families that they are seen the majority of them are first time flooded families so different people flooded in\nYou know the three floods people that threaten flood it three times some are moving but a lot of the people who flooded for the first time in the wake of Harvey are staying and saying this was you know\nA once a hopefully in a lifetime situation but we do know there will be continued flooding and so what the Jewish Federation has done\nPost the immediate recovery needs and raising twenty two million dollars is we've focused on resiliency and so we put together a taskforce with leadership\nThat has the flood resiliency taskforce and it was put together with three key areas to focus on the Justin equitable allocation of recovery funds for the families and institutions that we're most hard hit were working at the\nCounty city um national and you know state levels are looking at government funding\nWe're also looking at this is the third five hundred year flood as you referenced so we're looking at the prevention of this essential character of the Jewish community in this Milan and mid raised by Larry and how do we keep that\nAnd then the third piece is that we're making sure that the Jewish communities voice is heard to focus on a purposeful redesign and we worked with the University of Houston and Rice University to focus on this mile and a greater Maryland area\nTo figure out how to mitigate flooding for the future\nAnd what have you determine so far what what needs to change 'em for that community in particular that geographic area to be more resilient and when it comes to future flooding fresh\nFor the first thing is we all know it's very complicated life building these long term relationships with the public and elected officials were actually doing an event at\nThe Jaycee see on Sunday October twenty eighth that is focusing on recovery and rebuild we're having a panel discussion that haven't been so the Houston Chronicle is moderating and judge at I'm at will be speaking as well as our own director of Harvey recovery um\nAnd also somebody from the flood you know Harris County flood control and so we've learned it's very complicated where you know that we need to continue to advocate and work in partnership with the elected officials\nAre the work that's being done right now along raised by which we see every single day when we drive\nUp and down bracelet we know that was should've been done many years ago and has nothing to do with Harvey and so I think\nMost importantly we want to make sure that the recovery funds that are coming to this area we focused a lot leading up to the bond vote to get the Jewish community and others to get out to vote to vote in favor of it and now to hold\nThe elected officials accountable where those resources going and make sure that\nOur community that was so hard hit both the Jewish community and others that live in the area a receive the funding that is needed to focus on\nThe detention and retention sites and to make sure that we are focused on resiliency unfortunately flooding probably will happen again ah the reality is we just need to be prepared\nYou mentioned raise word or by drive up and down raised with all the time\nAnd have seen a lot of those signs in front of houses some of them for sale others saying oh you know\nThis whole uh raised by you know wrote us in such company demonstrating that they've lifted the house or or you know flooding repairs done or or signs that say never flooded you name it but there does seem to be a lot of that to suggest that there were some people\nThat come to the conclusion that in some cases maybe they've lived there two three generations but maybe it's time to move on does it change the identity of the neighborhood itself if you start to see even just a few folks move away\nWhat we've seen is that the community was already starting to spread out a little bit for Houston Jewish community has been very lucky that much of it has provoked and stayed in one kind of area\nBut we also have a number of Jews living throughout Houston and if they've as we know a large sprawling city so we talked a lot with real estate agents figuring out what's actually happening many people are staying the we're very concerned about the young families what we've seen is that\nThe empty nesters who were maybe thinking at some point in their retirement they're going to move out of the area and to a high rise living\nIf they flooded and Harvey it may have perpetuated that even quicker that they're moving out but the young families who have kids in school who are going to the synagogues to the Jaycee and utilizing the services in that area many of them are staying\nA but we have to think about\nYoung couples that are buying homes who don't have kids yet you know we worked with a family who flooded they were pregnant during Harvey they were living in a house they thought was their dream house always envisioned up sending their kids to Jewish day school in the area\nAnd after they flooded the realize you know we're going to move out of this area but for everyone that's moving out there is five and ten more that we talked to that are staying that are either raising their home rebuilding same we've only flooded ones and so\nWe both have to look at the changing\nRealities of the world we live in the sprawling world we live in how to provide services outside the walls but that's something that we knew before Harvey but much of the community is also staying in that area\n[noise] how long do you think it might take to fully recover from all the issues is that Harvey has raised for the Jewish community and ...\nWe've been really fortunate at the federation that were part of all larger national system and the federation ... from around the country and Jewish federations of North America have been here many times have given us advice and so the New York federation\nIn the wake of Superstorm Sandy ... told us that it took them five years to close their last case so we are planning for\nThree to five year period um we're looking at what we still need to fund a ... over the next three to four years\nAnd unfortunately what happens now is that the families that need help the cases are even more difficult now and they were initially because these are families that\nAre dealing with the TST that maybe thought initially they had the resources they've never isn't that wants to give they've never needed help and then they tried for a year\nTo make this work in only now are starting to realize that they need the help of caseworkers I'm from our partner at chess and so we're looking at recovery for families and individuals for the next three or four years\nPose apples cranberries
