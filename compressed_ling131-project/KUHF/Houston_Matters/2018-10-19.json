have to talk about flooding furnished up building in the floodplain as we often hear as necessary where are all these people can live if the if we are losing that real estate as well\nRight now we my Research Center we've been working with the mid ... by use communities that have flooded three years in a row and they still are valued as neighborhoods this is part of that preservation discussion so while back at a conference I made a a bit of a tongue in cheek\nStory this was before we had a bad hurricane and I talked about protecting the Mad Men dealt say if you look at historically where we

mid century or modern architecture but they're built somewhere where it floods there's been subsidence\nAnd then the next ... more water and so they're they're really wrestling on what is going to happen what does is what the whole neighborhoods looked like when we add a store we lift them a story because that's what we'll have to do a very different kind of neighborhood at that point but Marlon always\nAfter every event it declined in terms of his resale value but always came back and they came back faster and stronger than the rest of the Houston these are neighborhoods people value

looking at a a collection of developments is actually planned as a neighborhood that as more value\nYou can be more inclusive in terms of how you think about these neighbors so I think that ends up being important to factor for success that we don't talk about enough is really how we invest in the public realm and Houston or privatize city and we've always ... we we take\nWhat normally the commons or the we look at our atmosphere and streets and storm water systems we private sector always looked at as a place to dump greenhouse gas emissions water and traffic and\nAnd the city's

every ... begins and ends as a ... so you need to have\nCities are walkable and so that we need a lot of investment that way\nAnd being equitable were\nUh to me that celebrate diversity and we need to think about how we accommodate that going forward and we're not pushing people out we're not forcing people to makes the types of decisions that are really life fringe when you have to leave a

Houston Public media dot org\nI think we've got to recognize the conundrum we're in right so we are the fourth largest city were major metropolitan city where in the middle of a growth spurt and we haven't quite figure out we're figuring out how to handle the growth that we're experiencing and transition into a pedestrian\nFriendly city for um for example in downtown\nOne of the things I've noticed is we may need to begin to install lights for people to walk because when you're trying to make a right turn on a green light the desk dreams right away but it's also the cars right away so that's something that we haven't quite figured out here and that leads to those statistics that you just spoke up mhm\nPanel while the Houston Astros sadly had been bounced from their American League championship series against the Boston Red Sox\nSome of the more interesting scuttle but about the franchise this week had to do with developments just off the field and no I don't mean the fan interference in game for the ball club faces allegations of sign stealing according to multiple news reports during game one security at Boston's Fenway Park remove demand from the media area who claimed to be with the Astros\nSources say the man was taking pictures and texting and may have been attempting to steal pitching signs\nThe Cleveland Indians filed a complaint with major league baseball about a similar incident that reportedly happened to their ballpark during their playoff series with Houston earlier this month\nJeff ... who joined us Monday to talk about Houston sports tells news eighty eight seven that's stealing signs as commonplace in baseball and it's been happening for decades while it's technically not against the rules the league has banned electronic devices like cameras and phones from Doug outs to deter science dealing\nIn a statement Wednesday major league baseball noted the commissioner's office reinforced existing rules with all clubs before the playoffs and upon investigation concluded that the man in question was an Astros employee who is monitoring the field to ensure that the opposing club was not violating the rules [laughter]\nMajor league baseball's telling team's not to do that and says quote we consider the matter closed okay that's what they consider it but do you consider the matter good bad or ugly\nNatalie this is the panel of non experts yeah [laughter] well established I just wanted to make it out there there is no way round here before I started talking baseball\nMy thing with the science that shows that sign like even like to\nTell you that we know the pat on the head rub the belly and then the pitcher throws a fastball or something like that or\nThey put fingers down indicating certain kinds of pictures\nOr look at all the way I'm unclear as to the secrecy of the signs like\nThe whole it's on the flight for the whole world I'm going to be like in football where the coach will be talking with their mouth covered it why can't read their lips for the blaze they're calling\nWhich leads me to my next point maybe baseball to transition into a more digital age and get the pictures ear pieces so that\nCoaches like the third baseman can talk to whoever and the guy in the dugout can tell the pits or what he should be doing and all that without having to use science they can just talk into a little Mike that transmits to the ... like in football Evan\nFirst of all the stealing that I'm concerned about it after it's games is the theft of a home run\nYes where an item and I am that\nPerhaps or the focus should be but it is bad to have this concern about stealing signs but it's not unexpected I think there's a long history of pushing against the normal rules in baseball I can you just look at all of our favorite baseball movies and in rookie of the year a kid with some kind of\nPhysical disorder who could throw baseball's really fast was put on a baseball team he was in high school that's not allowed or an angels in the outfield they have supernatural assistant silly and then and in Arab bud seventh inning fetch high find it hard to believe that there's nothing in the rules that says a dog ... [laughter]\nI don't know if you're going to bring up baseball movies I feel I Do need to correct one thing rookie of the year I'm pretty sure he was like eleven or twelve oh\nJeez how does that allow that I don't know that seems inappropriate [laughter] Marcus\nGood better ugly I think it's silly you know stealing signs in baseball is the equivalent of catching somebody in the NCAA for compensating athletes right it's part of the game as part of the practice is part of the industry so why do you get all shock and awe when\nWhen it happened because it's actually what happens now here's the the silly part as you just say to create the commission said is not illegal\n[laughter] so if it's not illegal then where being is the problem\nI think maybe this is more of the unwritten rule that stealing signs on the field of play or managers and players in the dugout is different from having somebody on your staff\nIn the stands or near a dug out or in the immediate area snapping photographs and texting and that sort of\nYou know they do in other words I ... I can I can Rob the grocery store if I if I just go in and take the candy long as I Do use a gun is that we say I mean when\nI was there and I said he will run out of the show about run out fast

wanted to tell you this is\nYou know baseball mom apple pie all Americana is just kind of fading away releasing\nThese enormous [laughter] you know apple pies got weird taint the chemicals in it moms backed by a superPAC [laughter] anything any more I Can't\nWait until finally you get to a non controversial sport like football\nI I'm not sure that I'll tell you I don't understand\nThe idea this concept so he's still in our science there to sports that I don't understand this part of I don't understand tennis and the idea that you can't coach your player and I don't understand this idea about fines and baseball now if it was Cleveland or Boston that was doing it to us I Will feel completely\nDifferent [laughter]\nThere is one thing we can still believe in is that its root root root for the
