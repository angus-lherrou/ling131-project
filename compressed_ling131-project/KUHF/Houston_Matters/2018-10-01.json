Cohen today marks sixty years since operations began at NASA space city has of course been at the center of much of what NASA is accomplished in the six decades since the early days of space flight to the moon missions the shuttle program the international space station and more\nWhile now says history is filled with accomplishments the space agency is also had its share of tragedy\nFrom the Apollo one fire to the challenger and Columbia disasters after the ladder shuttle broke apart over east Texas as it re enters the earth's atmosphere back in January of two thousand three Dr John Logsdon was among those asked to serve on the Columbia accident investigation board\nThe former NASA advisory council member and founder of the space policy Institute at George Washington university is that a bird's eye view for many of NASA's finest and worst hours\nHe tells Houston ... NASA's was a part of America's answer to Sputnik the world's first artificial satellite and the Soviet union's opening salvo in the space race\nSplitting it came as a shock to ah people who haven't been paying attention it wasn't a surprise to the national leadership we knew that the Soviet Union was getting ready to launch a satellite but the leadership head and prepare the American public or the media so\nOne of my colleagues called it a media riot after ... foot thick\nIce in our work very hard to kind of tamp down that hysteria and and a follower of kind of modest start up of the space program\nThen on April the twelfth Nineteen sixty one a eureka garr and became the first human to orbit the earth\nAgain there was widespread why would the United states not first in doing this and John Kennedy a very different personality said this is important this is a part of the future of our country we've got to not only enter this competition for space achievement but when it\n... and as I understand that John F. Kennedy was very adamant about wanting to have us on the moon which would happen just a few years after his assassination\nBut Kennedy on April twentieth sixty one in reaction to dig Aaron wrote a kind of classic memos that said uh asked his advisors to find them a space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win\nAnd they answer came back send people to the moon so he decided very quickly that that the moon was going to be the destination for the United states in the sixties\nAnd the other thing not\nCause\nWell you're the best\nOf our energy and sales because that while I'm willing to accept one house phone\nAnd one way and so\nPresident Kennedy was an early champion for the space agency and its mission who for some of the other earliest champions of the space agency\nWell in the Congress majority leader Lyndon Johnson was a strong spokesman for the importance of the space program shepherded the national aeronautics in states jak through the Congress in the summer of Nineteen fifty eight\nThen as vice president Kennedy asked him to assume that particular responsibility for their space program so LBJ ran the review that led to the recommendation of setting a lunar landing as a national goal\nFor much there sure are preeminence in the peaceful expiration of outer space focusing on an expedition to the monitors and for operation where other powers fossil\nAlone if necessary [noise]\nAnd as you mentioned for coming up on the fiftieth anniversary of the lunar landing the Apollo eleven mission next year why is that still significant today in twenty Eighteen\nWell I mean there are only been these few\nLanding six landings in total\nApollo Thirteen would have been the seventh\nOnly twelve humans have actually walk on the surface of the moon\nWe haven't left low earth orbit since December Nineteen Seventy two so the fact that we once did this I think is is a a kind of a ... a reminder of things that the United states can do when it puts its mind to it\nIn addition to the office space and we look back at NASA and those who are going up to space sixty years ago\nIt really seems like at the time the expectations of millions of people rested on just a few chosen to do those missions what were some of the interesting human side of the space agency and his story and say look back sixty years\nYeah well I mean these were old people doing a job\nThey were not Superman and they're really in the early days were not very many women so except in support roles and it was all knew they were making it up as they went along because humans have never done things like this before so I I think the fact that\nThey were able to figure out a way to do this sort of thing\nWith what looks from today's perspective is pretty primitive technology a is a remarkable achievement\nHow would you characterize NASA's early years in comparison to the space agency today\nWell I mean you can't really\nThe replicate the excitement of Apollo and the political will in back of it it was a a mobilization peaceful but war like of financial in human resources four percent of the government budget spent in doing this was a\nDeadline of the end of the decade today we're have settled in a program of about one tenth\nThe share of the federal budget as was the case at the peak of Apollo uh\nWe're doing a a step by step program going as we can pay for it uh still have challenging goals but what kind of get there when we get there\nYou were also a member of the Columbia accident investigation forward what were you tasked with and what was the outcome of the investigation\nWillie investigation outcome was that uh there was a technical caused the accident but that technical cause was rooted in an organizational culture and the history of the organization and it was my responsibility as do the\nPortions of the investigation that dealt with a history of NASA and the history of the shuttle program so if\nIf one looks at at the report of the Columbia board you'll see a couple of chapters particularly\nFor those that are geeky enough chapter five and then we wrote at the end of the report uh some things about the future and I made a some contributions to that\nAs you look back at sixty years after NASA and we look ahead what do you think is the future of human space flight does the U.S have a prominent role in that area or where do you think that programs going\nWell I'm guarded Lee optimistic that were on our way back to the moon that after forty six years after leaving the moon in December of Nineteen Seventy two they essays on a path to send us people usa astronauts back beyond low earth orbit\nOr two litter or but then to the surface of the moon and eventually to Mars so I think the next sixty years we'll see a return to NASA's original role in science and exploration and will include humans traveling too distant destinations\nDr John Logsdon is the former director of the space policy Institute at George Washington university and a former member of the NASA advisory council he's also the author of the penguin book of outer space exploration he spoke with Houston matters Mackey Martin\nBefore there was NASA there was neck of the space agencies predecessor the NACE a was responsible for a number of innovations in aerospace and much of that work happened right here in Houston back in twenty Fifteen we spoke with NASA's chief a story and build Barry\nHe told Houston matters Michael ... about the ... achievements\nIn a sea of course I'm was her first American erotica research laboratory and um you would have thought that the with the Wright brothers having invent the airplane in the United states that the United states would have been I'm In a good position relative the rest of the world but strangely enough\nOr after the Wright brothers invented the airplane the Europeans actually kept further ahead of us in large part because there was considerable interest in Europe lots of a private money was going into the airplane research and and prices in various things like that but probably most importantly there are a government funded research laboratories all over Europe\nFeel that things are going in the right or the wrong direction and explain it in terms of people's opinions now the process on a technical side we do this a few different ways\nOne increasingly we're talking to people online where using large online samples that are balanced to be representative of the country and the way that I described a few moments ago we find that that gives people a chance to\nTake it at their leisure course people are busy they're increasingly busy we find that it's private so people can just click and answer the way that they would and you don't have that that interface between them and and an interviewer\nSo that's one way we do it in another way we do it the way we've done it for a long time also of course is by phone\nWe now have to dial today many thousands more phone numbers than pollsters use do ten twenty Thirty years ago and that's just a result again if people being busy the fact that we're dialing tons of cell phones people think sometimes we don't but we do we do come mostly cell phones\nWhen we do a phone call it's harder to find people and we recognize that but\nThat's the process of putting together this microcosm of the country and look pollsters will argue about how to do that pulls you argue about what is that composition and how should it be put together but that's why I always say you know what I Try to describe is\nYou have the poster tell you what it is that they were after what it is that they were trying to study and every poll is a study unto itself\nIn terms of putting together a sample and also in terms of the kinds of questions that that we're asking correct\nYeah well I wanted to get into that what should we understand about how questions are worded and how that can then influenced the response well\nLet me give you a simple example where you've got a subtle phrasing that didn't make a difference if I ask you how concerned are you about a given topic how concerned are you about I don't know what's a crime or an earthquake\nWell that sounds like it's a matter of degree oh how concerned should I be about an earthquake but if I subtly change the phrasing in that and I say are you concerned about an earthquake then that gives you a place to go yes or no and the people who are not concerned can more readily find\nTheir spot that's a subtle way but one that could make a big difference there was another example if I say you know how do you think the economy is doing is doing well or is doing badly then you've got a place to go no matter how you feel and I can measure degree after that will how or\nHow badly if I just wanted to say do you do you think the economy is good or how good do you think the economy is now I haven't given you a range of options now having given you that place to go no matter how you feel\nAnd so I think you know with a pollster tries to do is use language that's clear use language that's widely understood and also allows for a range of opinions and make it very clear\nThat whoever or however you feel you go through that poll and think oh yeah that one's my answer oh yeah that one's that one's mind and look very frankly\nI talked to earlier about how people we're busier and\nYou know we recognize that and it's also my job to make the poll engaging it's also my job to make sure that the polish thoughtful so that the responding looks at it and goes you know yeah not only is that is that's my point of view but also hey that that's really making me think that given me something to think about and we find that when we do post that way people respond and that's great\nWhat you're describing is what a responsible pollster would do but there are also pulls out there\nAre polls called push polls that are are designed to elicit a reaction to end up in a result that's favorable say for a candidate or an issue how can we as news consumers suss out which polls are like that and which ones aren't\nWell you know that could be a lot of work for people you certainly can go and see what the questions were and think for yourself how would I have answered that and you know sometimes that's the best test you can look at them and go wait a second you know what somebody who disagreed with me have a place to go here would I have a place to go here\nBut to the point that people are busy what you should do is follow a reputable news organization and one of the things that I Will try to do for people is that if we were poured a poll if I report and pull one that isn't mine\nThen we've looked at it for you and we've looked at it and said okay these questions were fair and\nThis sample composition looks like\nThe state or the country and was in a reasonable way that the pollster was trying to go after\nOr whatever it was they were they were trying to study and so hopefully it's it's sort of incumbent on meat up then pass that along to the end user to the viewer and the the consumer 'em to do that for you effectively correct\nThis is used to matters on Craig going we're talking with Anthony cell phone to CBS News elections in service director at the author of where did you get this number it's a new book about pulling do we use news consumers sometimes get mistaken impression because polling is\nMaybe simply asking the wrong question are you noted earlier that we shouldn't pay as much attention to the horse race and yet that seems to be what so many polls are about\nWell that's one of the things I'm trying to get past a little bit and look the horse races fun\nBut the horse race falls into this category I I often say of\nThe idea that one number can really tell you all you need to know if you go you go to the the wine store and you look at the price of a bottle of wine if it's really expensive does that mean it's going to taste good better than it cheaper bottle I Know a lot of people who like the the cheaper ones but that's one number that we think tells us a story\nLook what I Want to put a finer point on it I saw a recent poll which asked whether voters wanted Democrats or Republicans to win\nControl of the U.S house in November except that's not how we vote we vote for our own districts candidates so that poll result might give voters a false impression of what may actually happened in November\nCraig I'm really glad you brought that up because one of the things I think I see a lot out there right now is these national numbers that while they may accurately reflect that national preference you describe\nDo not directly speak to the election as it stands the race for Congress is a seat by ... contest you're correct obviously show what you want to do with folks want to do is pay attention to the seat number's\nPay attention to the folks are put out an estimate\nOf how many seats are liable to flip how many are in contention\nIs so there you go directly to what matters if what you're interested in is is who's up who's down you know what we're trying to do in our polling this year is we're concentrating in the battleground a house districts and we're putting up a seat estimate and then a seat number\nSo those national polls that are casting a what much wider net well that may be great if you've got a sample where people from any place from\nA you know Minnesota to Idaho to northern California to to Vermont are all saying they want you know Republicans or Democrats or whomever they want but they don't necessarily live and the districts that are going to swing the house\nAnd so that's part of a sample that and ultimately a number that might be interesting but may not tell you exactly what you want to know\nSome election polls focus on registered voters others sample likely voters how much of a difference is there in the findings of pools for those two groups\nBig and it's another one of those items that folks have got to pay attention to but then your posters should very clearly describe what it is that they've done here\nRegistered voters his office it's people who are who you know are are on the rolls and I registered to vote and or say that they are but likely voters is a different animal now you're talking about somebody's intention to do something not just what they think and\nThis is a struggle it might be one of the biggest struggles for pollsters\nWhen we go around and say it all comes down to turn out\nYou know that's not a throwaway line for a pollster we've got to figure out okay who says they're going to do something well most folks who say they're going to vote actually do that's the that's the good news\nBut and we also know that things get in the way for people you know election day rolls around or that absentee ballot is sitting on the kitchen table and you haven't had a chance to fill it out yet and\nYou got to do chores you got to go to work et cetera things getting away so you might have told the poster that you meant to vote but you didn't get to it is there any way we can anticipate who might do that\nOne thing pollsters uses your past vote history because we know that voting is looks like a habit people who've done it before\nTend to do it again so we might incorporate that into our likely voter calculus\nWe might ask people how enthusiastic they are because we might imagine that enthusiastic people are more likely to follow through though that can be a truck because they don't always some people vote like I said I Do that sense of habit so that can throw you off\nAll of that goes into that likely voter calculus folks should like I said ask the ... or to make sure the poster describes how they have to
