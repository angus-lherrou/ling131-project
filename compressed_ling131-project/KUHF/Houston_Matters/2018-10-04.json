affect imports of humanitarian goods bombed pale telling reporters David rulings disappointing but also lost for on the court\nA and each side is basically accusing the other of of of lying\nI understand property came up during the Houston city council meeting this morning\nYeah it it dominated the whole financial report segment a city controller Chris Brown a presented the latest ... cost estimates he claimed that or it could cost somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty five million dollars a year effective beginning of the next fiscal year\nUm and that would be on top of more than the roughly hundred million dollar deficit the city regularly runs because of the revenue cap\nMayor Turner meanwhile has argued that approval of this measure in November could mean layoffs or can you remind us what preemptive measures he's already taken a halo\nHe's already taken an across the board hiring freeze and that applies not just to the fire department it but to the police department and all the other cities departments and and the point that the mayor made again today is that\nUh if proposition be passes he's arguing that the cost of pay parity would not be borne by the fire department alone it would require them taking money out of the budget that every single city department so why bother hiring more people now\nMeanwhile city council approved a new contract with Houston police this morning [laughter]\nRight right and then that would increase the pay for everyone in the department or on a by four percent affected the beginning of the next fiscal year another three percent the following fiscal year for a total of seven percent\nFirefighters union and former Merrill candidate bill king are disputing that they claim it would it would actually be nine percent but regardless uh you know a controller brown was testifying in this he said it would actually drive up the cost of pay parity by somewhere in the neighborhood of forty three million dollars over the course of two years\nAnd again I guess we should just remind everybody that there are three different public employee unions that the city has to negotiate\nWith right and and in fact this actually came up a few days ago the police officers union um which is one of the other two unions came out against pay parity and they were making the same argument that the that the ... the third union is the one that covers all other city employees\nCouncil members also took a vote on an ordinance that would regulate so called a robot brussel first of all what what is this exact\nUh it is essentially a shop that would sell interactive robotic uh enter anthropomorphic sex dolls um and uh the the council voted against it unanimously\nAnd and what does that vote mean\nWell it effectively means that you're applying the same standards to these kinds of shops that you would to adult movie theaters peep shows\nA strip clubs and so forth you can't have any of these businesses within seven hundred and fifty feet of a school or church or similar buildings and if you're found violating the ordinance is in any way shape or form you could be fined do you have your license revoked and therefore shut down\nBefore we wrap up with your going back to the firefighters and pay parity here's kind of a Democratic Party now says they are going to hold the event on Saturday with mayor Turner\nA and with the chronicles Lisa Vulcan Burke having a discussion about proposition be a and they say the invitation is still open for Houston firefighters union to join in so that's where we stand as of this moment\nOkay so essentially would be Lisa fault in Burke interviewing the mayor and having an empty you\nKnow that's what it sounds like at the moment and her ... covers government and politics for news at eight Seventy ... thanks very much thank you\nJust ahead reaction to this morning's development\nAs control brown has said is going to increase the bill that is going to come do so just moving forward it didn't it didn't seem like it was the appropriate time\nI I agree it kind of unease the waters of time and it's not helpful to have the water is not even as safe as that was paid already there are a number of major cities that have approved pay parity police and firefighters but I have yet to see\nThe firefighters and ... and for advance a discussion of why it makes sense for the rate which police are paid to be the appropriate rate for which they are paid um perhaps it is but I just don't know I haven't even heard that argument from them um and also you know at first thing that both in for about these unions all three of these unions\nAnd you have paid already that would effectively constrain the ability to any of the ... to negotiate independently but the city which seems to be a thing they enjoy doing so I'm not sure\nLong term that really benefits the firefighters to have them that their hands tied that way\nIt does sort of create an environment I Would imagine where it's essentially like they're all one you write some degree\nIt does and and I think the other part of it is it it it takes away from the reality that a big part of these union discussions is always the pensions and they hunted three separate pensions at about three separate deals\nUm and there's been all always just sort of idea deferred compensation and these public sector unions where you may get less now but you have a more generous pension system and that's certainly been the case with fire\nAll right let's move on to everything else um the FBI's investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could conclude as soon as today it must be wrapped up by friday can legitimately comprehensive investigation be conducted in just a few days time\nI'm not sure that's what they're trying to do it sounds like they haven't interviewed a number of people who could be key witnesses in this context they haven't you know looking at a number of documents from either side I'm so I'm not sure I Would say that the FBI investigation is merely a fig leaf for Senate Republicans to proceed on the votes for confirmation but it doesn't seem like it's been conducted with\nA commitment to discovering the truth is this allegation from Dr Christine forward\nYeah I I think I think the scope of the investigation has been I'm necessarily limited and and so as a consequence I think there's enough time to have done it the question is whether or not it's been done and at the end of the day really what we're talking about is an investigation to convince three or four members of the United States Senate\nUh that person I'm a that that people can trust\nThe Trump Administration announced a trade deal Monday between the U.S and Canada and Mexico which could replace NAFTA the U.S MCA the United states Mexico Canada agreement it modifies trade policies on Karl labor and environmental standards as well as intellectual and digital property\nI won't get into all the details but uh there's some stuff about the percentage of car components would have to be manufactured in the three countries qualify for zero tariffs candidates dairy market is open to us farmers copyright terms extending\nFrom fifty to Seventy years in some other things uh this is expected to be signed by the end of next month with Congress likely to vote on it next year is this a a big win for President Trump\nYeah it really is a big win for for the president I mean I I think you can you can certainly quibble about his tactics um and his rhetoric leading up to then go ... ...\nThe the hard work by the U.S trade negotiators and a department of commerce in building this\nAgreement and and ultimately getting Canada sign on the eleventh hour um is is an unqualified when it's great for Texas a more than any other state we we benefit more ah from bilateral trade with Mexico and an increasingly trade with Canada and so as a consequence you say it's a positive thing\nUm I I Would just make two things this is not a this is essentially an update of of a twenty year old agreement NAFTA\nI think the approach that the president and the naming renaming of the agreement from NAFTA to us MCA is not insignificant in large part because he sees is less as a North American regional cooperative agreement and more of two bilateral deals\nThe United states first Mexico second and Canada third in that order what\nDoes it signal for trade policies with other nations\nYou know I thought there was a really interesting column by law Street Journal today about this talking about um you know really the deal as an illustration of the limits of production as much as just when you get right down to very unpopular I mean there's been a certain\nEmbrace of the protection is rhetoric from Republicans since Trump has been so protectionist in his rhetoric but if you start seeing them ever hit the road and like these tariffs he's been imposing the way they function as a tax on the team or the way they hurt producers in the United states um\nIt it kinda illustrates the way the deal I mean the deal ... editor ha it's a win for the president um it's also a relief to me as a tax and it's so much a\nLess far reaching than what the president himself has discussed wanting since he was on the campaign trail um and I think that points to the fact that ultimately the people in there and then ... trading ... than it is really wanted to get a deal done that would preserve the central structure and president NAFTA\nWhile the White House has been celebrating this deal President Trump is under renewed scrutiny about his finances on the heels of a pair of reports for says the president's net worth has dropped more than a billion dollars since twenty Fifteen meanwhile the New York times published a an extremely detailed investigation\nOf the president's finances and inheritance\nAnd found among other things that President inherited far more money from his father than he's previously indicated and that and again this is according to the times report that he and his siblings engaged in what can only really be characterized as fraudulent practices to deceive the IRS low balling real estate appraisals setting up a dummy corporation to pass money\nFrom Trump's father to the kids without paying state taxes now\nThe statute of limitations has long since up on all of this the IRS could still impose significant fines but this is\nPresident Trump's iris at the moment anyway so does any of this matter\nYeah I mean that's a good question I mean I I think the allegations are surrounding well three things or one that he was a self made billionaire um I I I think it's been swirling around that in some parts in some ways I think a reinforces why he has had a reluctance to to release his tax returns\nOn the second part about his the reduction in his OWN Network that assets in large part\nI'm increasingly a President Trump's assets were really a product of his brand\nI was more about putting the Trump name on items and people wanting to go there increasingly you become more polarizing people are less inclined to want to to purchase or stay at Trump branded things\nUm and finally I think that the underlying issue is whether there was fraud involved and I think this this may not ever get investigated but I think it then Haitians calls for a you know changes of the law that require releases of tax returns in ... and the like\nJay higher is an assistant professor political science at Texas southern university co
