how do you make a distinction between the hatred and threatened violence you have to be really really vigilant\nAnd pay attention to any hatred you see anywhere because hatred often leads to violence hate crimes are very violent crimes in most cases\nSo it all starts with words it all starts with somebody who telegraph what they're going to do\nA in words at least it did in this case\nAnd so we can't ignore\nAny words of hate we need to first of all address them personally if we feel comfortable with that but also to tell\nPeople who could possibly help law enforcement ... people who could possibly get to the bottom of what's going on and perhaps prevent something from happening or respond to it in the best possible way\nDo you know do you think law enforcement is doing enough to track this kind of rhetoric\n[noise] I think law enforcement is limited in what they can do because for instance one of the reasons a deal works very closely with law enforcement is because we can track 'em

College of medicine after the Texas higher education coordinating board\nUnanimously approved to Dr medicine degree for the institution but there's still several critical steps remaining before the college can opened its doors to students in December the university was submitted to application to the federal accredited and body for medical degree programs\nBut U H isn't the only institution in greater Houston looking to establish a medical school Michael haggard easier with more like a big rig of who else is pursuing this same Houston\nState University in Huntsville there are also involved in the application and accreditation process for their proposed College of osteopathic medicine they're breaking ground on a new facility and con row in November and if all goes as planned that want to start classes by the fall of twenty twenty\nThere are other teaching institutions in the Texas Medical center of course in around the region why do we need more medical\nSchools will Sam ... new dino the proposed college Dr Charles ... tells me his school and tends to focus on meeting a very specific need for east Texas\nAccess to good health care as a as a problem for that region a our hope is that once we establish ourselves\nAnd we work with those political partners\nThat will be able to change the workforce eventually after we Put Students are out there you go on to a good president season area we hope to be able to recruit from those areas so students will be comfortable going back\nTo where they came from the practice and so actually it is going to take a while but we will eventually sort of re populate that area where the kinds of people that we would hope to see in terms of\nProviding more access to primary care to some specialty care and mental health and those kinds of things\nRecruiting students from that area what else would you may be due to try and ensure that doctors should the graduate maybe stay in the air to serve those communities\nWhat other things that we talk through our political partners about is ah in the third and fourth year of course that's\nThe the third year is that Korea or there were they really are imbedded and they are in the clinical practice and then the fourth year they have a little bit more choice in terms of rotation so I have more flexibility in terms of a lock those but um\nOur intention is to have a\nWhen we select students for a particular area we have right now I think eight um regional hospitals that\nWe're going to be having students rotate through\nThe winter student goes to a place like let's say\nNagging do chess or someplace like maybe lockdown our Baptist or you know whatever they will stay there for the fall time they're not gonna just rotate around in different hospitals and different services they will be committed to that hospital for the the whole time that they're in the third year and most of the fourth year\nAnd so they'll live in that community and I'll get to know the the people in the hospital they'll get to know you know the people in the community the kind of be imprinted about what it's like the practice in that area when they go on and do a residency they may do it in that location or some place else but\nHopefully that and that and memory in that imprinting will help them make a decision that that's a good place to practice because they'll know every wound up being comfortable there and so the easy for them to come in to that barrier for practice\nAnd the school's going to focus on osteopathic medicine and that approach a socialistic approach to medicine can you remind us what that means to the layperson and how that's different than other approaches sure\nPeople use the term holistic kinda loosely uh I'm a family physician and uh most of my career uh we've always thought that family physicians a practice holistic medicine you know whole the whole patient the approach\nThat that could be and these are the what was it didn't matter if you're a family doctor you had that\n... medicine as a philosophy and as a college shares that philosophy but they also have a history of of utilizing on approach to the patient that also includes a looking at\nWhat we call ... says the body's ability to heal itself and that sometimes ah\nPeople will do better if they are able to have a certain kind of a line that the that and you can help them with a lot of skills skeletal issues that sometimes also help them heal better but it's ... it's a process of\nManipulation that that was then developed a sense the very beginning back in eighty Eighteen eighties\nUh Eighteen nineties and uh\nBut it's not ... not everything that we do it's\nThey use a lot of times that those techniques and diagnostic approach to patients and ah and sometimes in treatment but uh you can graduate from an osteopathic medical school and you can go and do anything you want\nWe have neurosurgeons dermatologist psychiatrists everything you're everything and think of that that basic or underlying principal a holistic care and manipulation is still part of the early medical school training\nWhy did the university's leadership decide that was the right approach to serve these rural communities\nI think that the um very early on when they started thinking about having a a medical school\nThey understood that they're a mission was to help reframe the medical community in east Texas that there is a dire need and so they looked\nAt the opportunities that exist and to help make that happen\nAnd what they found out was that a osteopathic a medicine or graduated more people into primary care and rural practice then did the Alamo panic professional them decide\nAnd or even though the idea of can go on and do everything they want to do like I said a large number of them choose to do primary care like I did\nAnd choose to work in a rural and underserved communities and I think that's that's part of the training that they get a there's less emphasis on some specialty career development and a little bit more emphasis on primary care\nIs used in matters of Michael nice talking with Dr Charles ... the dean of shame ... universities proposed College of osteopathic medicine and one of the challenges you think are trying to launch a new medical school these days in the current healthcare Clement the current education Clement whatever\nYeah I'm all those are interesting questions for a lot of different reasons um I think Texas or the Texas market is a little different and I think you can say that\nPretty much wherever you go you know the Florida market is very much different than ah than Texas in every state has its own um\nIts own variation or what is important and how things work and uh\nWhen you come to places like Texas you really

S. how did you strive to capture both sides because you're you're taking it from the perspective of both the immigrants but then also the border patrol agents what what was your goal and setting out to do this\nThat's where I ... I I really tried to make this a comprehensive study of immigration and border security\nI I returned to the U.S after living Seventeen years abroad or most of my career and much of that was in Latin America\nSo I covered immigration really from the other side of the border and so I had a a perspective um that was broadened by that are of covering immigrants or for a number of years south of the border\nAnd so really I'm In and speaking Spanish of course helped quite a bit because most of the immigration at least undocumented immigration to this country is from Central America and Mexico and Spanish is the language\nAnd so being able to connect with people really made a difference there in establishing trust quickly 'cause there's a photo journalist we don't have time often to spend days with people before we take pictures we have to get in and gain some trust immediately\nAnd um I was able to do that with immigrants are both on their journey\nUp to the U.S and also here within the United states now with the border patrol and the other agencies are federal agencies we have on the U.S Mexico border\nThey really are in some ways there are a law enforcement structure but also they draw heavily from a military structure\nAnd because I photographed us conflicts in other parts of the world I'd come to understand how to get access I'm In the bureaucracy of a military setting and and that that really works within a law enforcement setting as well\nAnd so I could get up in the air and helicopters or with the customs and border protection the pilots as they patrolled over the border I could go out on um on operations with the border patrol when they're tracking groups of people and drug smugglers through the brush along the Rio Grande\nAnd getting that inside access is really key to telling a balanced story and are not just not just from one side I'm not an activist I'm a journalist and I want to I Want people to understand what the ... the story is in a comprehensive way\nWhat kinds of things are you looking for what what's the stuff that catches your eye and tells you this is something worth taking a photograph of well\nAs a still photographer I'm really looking for moments I'm looking for that fraction of a second that tell something um something different that reveals what's going on with video of course it's very different you're looking at the series in sequences\nOf images but with the still photo really comes down to those moments and the pictures that stand the test of time are the ones that make us feel and so\nIf I can tell a story and I can make the viewer\nFeel like they were there feel the emotion of that moment and touch them um maybe it may change their opinion a bit maybe it'll change their minds and sometimes now and again my pictures a will change of government policy and the and we want to increase understanding\nAnd the and that's why I Do this what\nDid you learn was there anything new that you didn't know before about the whole of immigration that you that you uncovered\nBut I've seen over the years since I started this project about ten years ago that the uh the breakdown of people who come in as much different when I first started this project it was mostly men into a few women coming over 'em to seek employment in the U.S\nAnd now you have so many families are coming from Central America and that has a lot to do with the with the rise in violence or in places in northern Central America like Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador are so many families are coming across an unaccompanied minors as well\nAnd often times they are actually seeking out to border patrol agents once they come across the Rio Grande because they want to turn themselves in for asylum so it's very a very different kind of story\nWere there any common elements that you've noticed between photographs\nWell for me showing the humanity and the story is key because um it's very easy to see undocumented immigration in terms of statistics\nIt's hard to say where that tipping point and I would almost argue that at the time that that diagnosis is being made is a point when patients can very actively engaging future planning and really think about [noise]\nRegardless of whether they think they reached the tipping point they probably want to start making these kinds of plans because other people around them may think that they're already passed that tipping point\nThat's also a conversation or you'd be hard pressed to find somebody that wants to have\n... absolutely I think that a lot of patients are\nHesitant to have that conversation because they feel ate it might not never happened to me or\nBe a it's a very morbid to discuss this er and they're just afraid of what that will stand for because once you're making those decisions you're realizing I'm going to lose a lot I'm going into my independence I'm going to lose my the ability to take care of myself my ability to drive myself and even participate in the things I Love\nSo you're becoming you're coming face to face with the with the realization that I'm making decisions about not doing the things I Love to do anymore and having to relinquish the control that I have to somebody else to my caregivers and many in many cases in the office after home seasons probably a more than I Do it's their adult children who have to make tough decisions for them at that point\nAnd how important is to have this conversation early quickly after the diagnosis\nYeah I ... I Can't stress enough how important it is because\nUm the the longer people wait to have these conversations they then have them under duress when these decisions become urgent\nWhen it becomes um almost an emergency to try to figure out what the future plan is going to be\nIt's so important to try to set a head one's future plans very early on in the course of an illness like dementia or Alzheimer's that is going to impact the ability to make those decisions later and to express those things to your family and your caregivers\nAre so that they know what the ideal scenario would look like if you could pointed out today\nIsrael does ... if you wait too long and the vet dementia or Alzheimer's starts and you can reach a point where you may not even realize that you have this disease\nAbsolutely and at that point it might be too late for you to make a decision that would be found for your medical care so again it's the risk of having this conversation a little too early perhaps maybe but it is one of the situation and we were about to be over prepared\nAnd set yourself up for you just imagine worst case scenario I hate to say it that way or the ... that your family members will appreciate that conversation because they are concerned later on if something that as a patient you might not realize that you're putting them at the dress\nIs used in matters on credit Cohen we're talking with Isabel does from Baylor College of medicine and Dr highly homes from governor medical school at UT health about how to know when you should step back from work or social events to\nCare for your health food particularly a mid life altering diagnoses from dementia captured the stroke of unpredictable about dementia and Alzheimer's we welcome your thoughts at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can reach out to us on Twitter at Houston matters you can email us\nAt talk of Houston matters dot org is does come up in other instances catchers stroke other diagnoses how was the conversation different in most cases\nIn that situation when I'm In the office but the room with the patient um\nThere was more of a finite start to okay effective immediately you can no longer drive for instance because you had the stroke\nLast week you just got to start from the hospital and you still don't have you have not gained your motor skills so there's a clear beginning to when you are no longer going to be able to care for yourself for instance and you're gonna have to relinquish that independence to somebody else\nOr as and dementia our doctor homes can speak more to it it's more of a ... a slow transition but are definitely in stroke victims chemo patients seizure patient so that they are more aware of their their participating in their everyday activities except that now there's a finite point where you might not be able to Dr ...\n[noise] I agree I mean as Isabel thing that with other disease conditions there is sometimes more finite point at which these decisions happen or their necessitate and\nI think also the stakes are a little different\nIn that judgment in inside are uniquely affected in dementia and Alzheimer's and it makes it extremely challenging to have a caring and thoughtful conversation about removing someone's independence particularly if they find that they don't feel impaired\nAnd um it can be very difficult to tell when someone is impaired and family members and caregivers are desperately trying to work with health care professionals to to convince their family members to do what they think is right for them and\nThere can be a very difficult point at which determining that you're at that tipping point or that you're really at that point where you would step back and change the things that you do and again in other conditions it might be a little bit more straightforward and there's not as much of the issue of judgment and insight and\nWe have a question from hell he asks is there are ways someone could self assess a potential future dementia and maybe by sending themselves a questionnaire to be reminded of in the future\nWell there's several questionnaires are dementia questionnaires out there I Know that at a clinic about once a year we offer a a very brief a mini cognitive assessment test assessment\nAnd uh your provider your your health care provider probably has access to this I don't know what tests that are used Dr homes we use them any cause but that's one of the ones that are several out there there\nAre several screening tests I think the challenge would be the any screening test that we do have\nIs designed to at least ... to detect mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and a lot of um researchers would suggest that we probably need to be intervening in preventing illness well before those symptoms have become a parent because the disease is already well on its way\nSo I don't have a great answer that unfortunately we don't have a great earlier screening test um I liked the idea of sending herself for future questionnaire that's really intriguing to me I think in the future will\nWe'd be using different questionnaires as well I think the more important factors right now would be family history any suggestion and family genetic history of early onset dementia\nI think even more important than any of that is healthy lifestyle in midlife that's probably the better way to plan and prevent that we have currently\nHave you to personally are gone through this with family or quote close friends\nUm I'm indirectly going through with my mother and my aunt and my grandmother my grandmother being shown some signs of dementia but also I'm having a resistance to as just making a plan for herself not realizing that she's not in a position to take care of herself and also\nHer ... she's now I'm no longer able to drive because her diabetes affect her eyesight and sell the my my mother and my aunt make those decisions ... decisions\nAbout who's going to take mom to air it to the hospital and she had a fit and she was asked with aggressive with the caregiver the other day seeing that and hearing it from them I think I think I'm Talking to on a patient and their doctor hopes\nVery similarly to Isabel I'm really addressing my grandmothers and ability to be safe independently\nAnd there were some decisions that she chose to scale back and you know again when you think about what that tipping point is we it's hard to know sometimes the older people feel uncomfortable in situations that require complex planning and thinking and they choose to not do things like Dr\nBut then there might be other times I'm such a case with my grandmother when there are other unsafe situations that really had to intervene upon and it's it can get very ugly because again it's a disagreement between you know your family member who you think he's impaired and everybody else who really sees the unsafe things that are happening\nYou mentioned the affair that are ... and since Justice O'Connor as an example is that somebody who can advocate on behalf of all timers and that she's dealing with it herself or or is unlikely to do so as you\nWere trenches from public life um that does then sometimes fall to doctors to do a and and you wanted to point out an event this weekend\n[noise] yes so this weekend on Saturday is to walk to end all timers in Houston and it's at the University of Houston campus\nI should have looked at the time when I said that I was going to talk about it posted a link to more information and has to have to Houston matters dot org it's a wonderful event and again it's one of those events where you see so many ... family members caregivers and health care professionals\nBut who is really missing from the event is the family meant that the patients themselves there are definitely some older people who are clearly affected by the elements to come out and walk and certainly it's a perfect event because walking is one of the best interventions for people with\nDementia even with severe dementia so it's a really moving moving event and I encourage people to attend or at least to donate to a team\nDoctor Holly homes is director of the division of geriatric and palliative medicine at McGovern medical school at UT health Isabel Valdez is physician's assistant and
