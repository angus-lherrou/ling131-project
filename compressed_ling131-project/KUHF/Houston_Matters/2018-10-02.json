Cohen today marks sixty years since operations began at NASA space city has of course been at the center of much of what NASA is accomplished in six decades since from the early days of space flight to the moon missions the shuttle program the international space station in more\nWellness his history is filled with accomplishments the space agency is also had its share of tragedy\nFrom the Apollo one fire to the challenger and Columbia disasters\nAfter the ladder shuttle broke apart over east Texas as it re enters the earth's atmosphere back in January of two thousand three Dr John Logsdon was among those asked to serve on the Columbia accident investigation board the former NASA advisory council member and founder of the space policy Institute at George Washington university\nIs that a bird's eye view for many of NASA's finest and worst hours\nHe tells he used to ... NASA's was a part of America's answer to Sputnik the world's first artificial satellite and the Soviet union's opening salvo in the space race\nSplitting it came as a shock to uh people who hadn't been paying attention it wasn't a surprise\nTo the national leadership we knew that the Soviet Union was getting ready to launch a satellite but the leadership head and prepare the American public or the media so one of my colleagues called it a media riot after ... but like I said our work very hard to kind of tamp down\nThat hysteria and and a follower of kind of modest start up the space program\nThen on April the twelfth Nineteen sixty one a eureka Gehring became the first human to orbit the earth\nAgain there was widespread why would the United states not first in doing this and John Kennedy a very different personality said this is important as as a part of the future of our country we've got to not only enter this competition for space achievement but when it\n... and as I understand that John F. Kennedy was very adamant about wanting to have us on the moon which would happen just a few years after his assassination\nBut Kennedy on April twentieth sixty one in reaction to dig Aaron wrote a kind of classic memos that said uh asked his advisors to find them as space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win\nThis programming is brought to you by the region score and independent Catholic school were boys through eighth grade worked at the kinds of scholars and gentlemen welcome Wednesday tours this far more out there we just score dot org\nCulture and the history of the organization and it was my responsibility as do the portions of the investigation that dealt with a history of deaths in the history of the shuttle program so if if one looks at at the report of the Columbia board you'll see a couple of chapters particularly\nFor those that are geeky enough chapter five and then we wrote at the end of the report uh some things about the future and I made a some contributions to that\nAs you look back at sixty years after NASA and we look ahead what do you think is the future of human space flight does the U.S have a prominent role in that area or where do you think that programs going\nWell I'm guarded Lee optimistic that were on our way back to the moon\nThat after forty six years after leaving the moon in December of Nineteen Seventy two NASA is on a path to send us people usa astronauts back beyond low earth orbit\nOr two litter or but then to the surface of the moon and eventually to Mars so I think the next sixty years we'll see a return to NASA's original role in science and exploration and will include humans traveling too distant destinations\nDr John Logsdon is the former director of the space policy Institute at George Washington university and a former member of the NASA advisory council he's also the author of the penguin book of outer space exploration he spoke of Houston matters Mackey Martin\nBefore there was NASA there was neck of the space agencies predecessor the N. A. C. A. was responsible for a number of innovations in aerospace and much of that work happened right here in Houston\nBack in twenty Fifteen we spoke with NASA's chief historian bill Barry he told Houston matters Michael ... about the ... the chief ...\n... of course was the first American erotica research laboratory and um you would have thought that um with the Wright brothers having invent the airplane in the United states that the United states would have been I'm In a good position relative the rest of the world but strangely enough\nDo well let's talk about process whatever works for all the results of an opinion poll orders maybe some questions we should ask about how that poll was conducted\nWell the first thing everybody should do is for any given number they should demand that the pollsters say because so people are voting for candidate X Y and make sure you're pollster delivers you the costs because they like what he's done on the economy because they\nFeel that things are going in the right or the wrong direction and explain it in terms of people's opinions now the process on a technical side we do this a few different ways\nOne increasingly we're talking to people online where using large online samples that are balanced to be representative of the country in the way that I described a few moments\nTo go we find that that gives people a chance to take it at their leisure course people are busy they're increasingly busy we find that it's private so people can just click and answer the way that they would and you don't have that that interface between them and and an interviewer\nSo that's one way we do it in another way we do it the way we've done it for a long time also of course is by phone\nWe now have to dial today many thousands more phone numbers than pollsters use do ten twenty Thirty years ago\nAnd that's just a result again if people being busy the fact that we're dialing tons of cell phones people think sometimes we don't but we do we do come mostly cell phones when we do a phone call it's harder to find people and we recognize that but\nThat's the process of putting together this microcosm of the country and the pollsters will argue about how to do that pollsters will argue about what is that composition and how should it be\nPut together but that's why I always say you know what I Try to describe is you have a poster tell you what it is that they were after what it is that they were trying to study and every poll is a study unto itself\nIn terms of putting together a sample and also in terms of the kinds of questions that that we're asking correct\nYeah well I wanted to get into that what should we understand about how questions are worded and how that can then influenced the response\nWell let me give you a simple example where you've got a subtle phrasing that can make a difference if I ask you how concerned are you about a given topic how concerned are you about I don't know what's a crime or an earthquake\nWell that sounds like it's a matter of degree oh how concerned should I be about an earthquake but if I subtly change the phrasing in that and I say are you concerned about an earthquake then that gives you a place to go yes or no and the people who are not concerned can more readily find\nTheir spot that's a subtle way but one that could make a big difference there was another example if I say you know how do you think the economy is doing is they're doing well or is doing badly then you've got a place to go no matter how you feel and I can measure degree after that will how well or\nHow badly if I just wanted to say do you do you think the economy is good or how good do you think the economy is now I haven't given you a range of options now having given you that place to go no matter how you feel\nAnd so I think you know with a pollster tries to do is use language that's clear use language that's widely understood and also allows for a range of opinions and make it very clear\nThat whoever or however you feel you go through that poll and think oh yeah that one's my answer oh yeah that one's that one's mind and look very frankly\nI talked earlier about how people we're busier and you know we recognize that and it's also my job to make the poll engaging it's also my job to make sure that the polls thoughtful so that the respondents looks at it and goes you know yeah not only is that is that's my point of view\nBut also hey that that's really making me think that given me something to think about and we find that when we do post that way people are smart and that's great\nWhat you're describing is what a responsible pollster would do but there are also pulls out there\nAre polls called push polls that are are designed to elicit a reaction to end up in a result that's favorable say for a candidate or an issue how can we as news consumers suss out which polls are like that and which ones\nAren't well you know that could be a lot of work for people you certainly can go and see what the questions were\nAnd think for yourself how would I have answered that and you know sometimes that's the best test you can look at them and go wait a second you know what somebody who disagreed with me have a place to go here would I have a place to go here\nBut to the point that people are busy what you should do is follow a reputable news organization and one of the things that I Will try to do\nFor people is that if we report a poll if I report a poll one that isn't mine\nThen we've looked at it for you and we've looked at it and said okay these questions were fair and\nThis sample composition looks like\nThe state or the country and was in a reasonable way that the pollster was trying to go after\nOr whatever it was they were they were trying to study and so hopefully it's it's sort of incumbent on meat up then pass that along to the end user to the viewer and the the consumer um it didn't do that for you effectively crack\nThis is Houston matters on ... and we're talking with Anthony cellphone to CBS News elections in surveys director and the author of where did you get this number it's a new book about pulling do we as news consumers sometimes get mistaken impression because polling is\nMaybe simply asking the wrong question are you noted earlier that we shouldn't pay as much attention to the horse race and yet that seems to be what so many polls are about\nWell that's one of the things I'm trying to get past a little bit and look the horse races fun\nBut the horse race falls into this category I I often say of\nThe idea that one number can really tell you all you need to know if you go you go to the the wine store and you look at the price of a bottle of wine if it's really expensive does that mean it's going to taste good\nBetter than it cheaper bottle I Know a lot of people who like the the cheaper ones but that's one number that we think tells us a story what let me when I\nWhen we put a finer point on it I saw a recent poll which asked whether voters wanted Democrats or Republicans to win control of the U.S house in November except that's not how we vote or we vote for our own districts candidates so that poll result might give voters of false impression of what may actually happened in November\nCraig I'm really glad you brought that up because one of the things I think I see a lot out there right now is the national numbers that while they may accurately reflect that national preference you describe\nDo not directly speak to the election as it stands the race for Congress is a seat by she contest you're correct obviously show what you want to do with folks want to do is pay attention to the seat number's pay attention to the folks who\nAbout an estimate of how many seats are liable to flip how many are in contention\nIs so there you go directly to what matters if what you're interested in is is who's up who's down you know what we're trying to do in our polling this year is we're concentrating in the battleground a house districts and we're putting up a seat estimate and in a seat number\nSo those national polls that are casting a much wider net\nWell that may be great if you've got a sample where people from any place from a you know Minnesota to Idaho to northern California to to Vermont are all saying they want you know Republicans or Democrats or whomever they want but they don't necessarily live and the districts that are going to swing the house\nAnd so that's part of a sample that and ultimately a number that might be interesting but may not tell you exactly what you want to know\nSome election polls focus on registered voters others sample likely voters how much of a difference is there in the findings of pools for those two groups\nBig and it's another one of those items that\nFolks have got to pay attention to but then you're poster should very clearly describe what it is that they've done here\nRegistered voters his office it's people who are who you know are are on the rolls I registered to vote and or say that they are\nBut likely voters is a different animal now you're talking about somebody's intention to do something not just what they think and this is a struggle it might be one of the biggest struggles for pollsters\nWhen we go around and say it all comes down to turn out\nYou know that's not a throwaway line for a pollster we've got to figure out okay who says they are going to do something well most folks who say they're going to vote actually do that's the that's the good news\nBut then we also know that things get in the way for people you know election day rolls around or that absentee ballot is\nSitting on the kitchen table and you haven't had a chance to fill it out yet and you got to do chores you got to go to work et cetera things get in a way so you might have told the poster that you meant to vote but you didn't get to it is there any way we can anticipate who might do that\nOne thing pollsters uses your past vote history because we know that voting is looks like a habit people who've done it before tend to do it again so we might incorporate that into our likely voter calculus we might ask people\nHow enthusiastic they are because we might imagine that enthusiastic people are more likely to follow through though that can be a truck because they don't know if some people vote like I said I don't know that sense of habit so that can throw you off\nMy own a\nMen to men do\nChoose new old man\n\nI've got another bag\nI guess my rather\nThan issues\nIn wild anticipation\nBall\nThat since we\nI mean we\nWell Shaq [noise]\nMy hot could vie does [noise]\nWhy did I decide\n...\nNa na\nI never felt so hot and could be\n\nLittle why did I\nThe\nGym\nThan\nYeah

into Texas seventh congressional district today we hear from congressman Culberson though he was unable to join his life he spoke last week with my colleague Josh was in\nWho also shared some questions from your fellow listeners Josh began by asking the congressmen the questions we've asked every candidate we've interviewed starting with a request for an example of a compromise he's forged in the past\nThe most immediate example Josh is the work that I did to spearhead the passage of the largest hurricane recovery package and the nation's history I organized the Texas and Florida delegations to work together to pass a series of hurricane relief bills and that involved\nMany moving parts a whole variety of compromises with members who had different districts different levels of damage\nAnd I remember in particular sitting down with my colleagues representative Henry Clay are of Laredo and representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and we three uh personally went through the bill\nLine by line rewriting in the margins key portions of the bill and that effort in modifying the community development block grant disaster relief program\nAnd ensuring that that people are not denied a the opportunity to get an SBA loan as well as a\nDisaster relief grant was a key compromise that I worked out with mine Democrat colleagues literally just sitting around a table with a cold Coca Cola and a note pads and and the mutual friendship and trust that we have for each other\n... are of course focused on flood mitigation a year after Harvey what would you do if we elected to Congress to secure funding for future flood mitigation projects in the region\nWhile I have already in the time I've served on the Appropriations Committee secured about three hundred million dollars for Braves bio over a hundred million for buffalo bio and I've secured hundreds of millions of dollars for the Harris County flood control district countywide for example the after tropical storm Allison\nWhen the medical center flooded so badly\nI was able as inappropriate or to target money\nTo harden the basements install waterproof doors\nMove the utilities out of the basements and up to higher levels\nAnd I was able to waterproof the basement\nOf the medical center so successfully that after Allison Hermann hospital had thirty eight feet of water in the lobby after eleven inches of rain but after Harvey and almost forty inches of rain in the same location all they got was a wet carpet\nSo I have already done a tremendous amount of work to strengthen Harris counties foreign control network I'm In the right place at the right time\nTo make sure that Houston's protected against the next big storm and when Harvey hit when I finally got back to Washington\nThe chairman of the full Appropriations Committee he's from New Jersey his name is Rodney ... and he said John I'm Wondering are praying for you but most of all John I Want you to know that I remember you were the only Texas Republican that voted for the hurricane Sandy relief package\nAnd when my constituents were drowning you were there for me you were the only Texas Republican there for me so I'm here for you I Want you to drive this bill\nAnd you tell me what you need and will do it together I Want us to look at this terrible storm the same way that our forefathers looked at the disastrous aftermath of the Nineteen hundred storm that hit Galveston we should make certain that we are building our flood control infrastructure to protect\nFuture generations against the next big storm in the same way that our forefathers used that terrible disaster the Nineteen hundred storm to build the Houston ship channel we need to do something far reaching and a great impact to future generations and I've already laid the foundation to do that\nAs the only appropriate or from South east Texas\nWhat do you see as your role personally and Congress's role broadly in providing a check on the executive branch\nI Do that routinely as the chairman of a subcommittee on appropriations the power of the purse is the most effective check and balance on the executive that the founders created the power of the person is something that a subcommittee chairman has a a great deal of authority over\nIn a very real sense I Am the CFO the D. O. J.\nUh my subcommittee is responsible for funding the department of justice all federal law enforcement and the department of commerce National Science foundation Noah and NASA for example I've already been a check and balance on the administration when the office of management and budget released to totally inadequate\nHurricane relief bill with a absurdly low number I immediately got to work in a made sure that the number that we increase the amount of money coming to Texas and Florida\nAnd then in the incidence of the department of commerce for example on these tariffs that caused me a lot of worry I'm a free trader and tariffs are and trade wars are always a a a scary situation and can really damage American industry I'm very concerned about the effect on uh the American oil and gas\nIndustry and and use in particular are a lot of the specialized\nService companies that are in a district seven that need specialized steel products that can only be obtained from certain foreign sources\nI wanted to be certain that the department of commerce was granting exceptions to these tariffs and an expeditious way\nSo I have worked with congressman Kevin Brady and succeeded in persuading the department to expedite the entire exception process to grant exceptions more rapidly and efficiently to companies that need them or that have had been hurt by tariffs and to\nA frankly changed the entire process that the department uses in applying tariffs I made a brought together chairman Brady of the ways and Means Committee secretary Ross of the department of commerce\nAnd pointed out to the secretary that is as his banker and as the person responsible for ensuring that our constituents harder and tax dollars wisely spent that I wanted a secretary Ross to please\nBe sure that chairman Brady was satisfied with the department of commerce is response to the to the problems created by the tariffs because we need to think of chairman Brady is it as the chairman of the committee of compliance\nTo secretary of commerce has an obligation to comply with the statutes and laws enacted by Congress and it's my job is the appropriate or to be a check and balance on the administration to ensure that the terms and conditions\nOf the money that the taxpayers invested in the department of commerce are complied with and that is something I came up with on my own and it worked so the Congress can be and I have been ineffective check and balance on this administration and on previous administrations\nImmigration has been top of mind for many Texans what would you do if we elected to move Congress forward in improving our system of immigration\nI'll continue the work I've already done to hire additional prosecutors for the southern border as the chairman of the committee that funds federal law enforcement\nI made sure that there is ample funding for hundreds of new prosecutors to the southern border\nOf new marshals of new courtroom support personnel a new detention bed facilities and also to hire over three hundred new immigration judges to rapidly here claims of asylum and and deal with them expeditiously so people can have their day in court\nA sense of pain through the Congress that year was modified the final version of the bill of course I voted for\nUh but those are the Bible program is about to expire and I will vote once again to reauthorize it\nAnd I will vote to reauthorize the violence against women act\nAnd my Congress justice science appropriations bill contains record levels of funding for those programs to protect non only women against violence but also children and I've also made sure to fully fund the federal grants that are used by local law enforcement agencies to eliminate the backlog\nOf rape kits to ensure that those violent criminals are identified a genetically and prosecuted and we've had a lot of success eliminating the backlog of rape kits around the country\nAnd I do all that I can to ensure that a local police have the federal support that they need not only for their laboratories but to maintain safety their officers\nAnd also create programs to make it easier and less traumatic for victims of sexual assault to report those crimes to local law enforcement so the perpetrators can be prosecuted and taken off the streets as quickly as possible\nChristina in Cyprus asked would you support pro public safety universal comprehensive gun reform that fits within the confines of the second amendment and related U.S Supreme court rulings\nI have always supported enforcing existing law which is actually very specific and clear about keeping guns out of the hands\nOf people who are either have been convicted of a crime declared mentally incompetent by a court of law and making sure that those people are listed on the national instant criminal background check database\nI pass legislation when my colleague representative Henry Clay are of Laredo and a Senator John Cornyn\nTo fix the instant background check database to ensure that it is accurate because the ... the murder and southern springs\nWould not have been able to buy a gun if the air force had simply entered his name on the instant background check database accurately our legislation would eliminate bonuses and cut the pay of any\nFederal employee that fails to update accurately the instant criminal background check database making that database much more accurate\nI've also as the chairman of the committee that funds federal law enforcement\nMade sure that the ATF and the FBI have the funding they need to investigate and prosecute people who commit crimes with guns there's a federal law in the books that I'm working aggressively to enforce that adds an automatic five year penalty to anyone who commits a crime with a gun\nAnd and the federal system there is no parole so it's important that those existing laws be strictly enforced\nAnd I'm also as chairman of the subcommittee that funds law

U. H. F. radio or a local TV station and you're asked questions like are you going to vote you're more likely to say yes when in fact you know you're not going to vote why because as a social expectation that voting is a responsible\nThing you should do and you're not telling somebody on the phone if you don't know a complete stranger I'm not going to engage in a socially responsible behavior sometimes I've ERs interactive voice recorded famous for being really robocalls are more accurate because people will talk to a recorded voice a little bit more honestly that they would\nAnd a controversial question and do a live person as I said before the other challenges a residential mobility if you're trying to pull people one of the critical things and political polling is to know who votes\nIt's easy to ask people what they're going to do Democrat Republican conservative liberal for or against a pay raise for firemen\nBut it's really hard to figure out whether they're going to show up and one of the things that we've noticed over the years as as a rowing chasm between people who could vote\nCitizens over Eighteen and the people that do vote to give you an idea of that when I Do a survey first thing I ask is what am I looking at in the way of a likely turn out so last August twenty fifth election for a bond and the county to fight flooding we only got six and a half seven percent voter turnout\nThat's what I expected to see a Mr senator county clerk who's an experienced person running elections say twelve percent I thought he was wrong I didn't go on the air and say that\nBut I built my sample around six and a half seven eight percent and\nIt turns out I was right now I wasn't right because I was guessing I actually sat down and looked in elections that look like that bond and said how many people show up\nAnd once I saw that it was seven eight at the most ten percent I went back to the voter lists which is public and said who did show up\nOne of the things we found out was the median age of a voter in Harris County ... election on the twenty fifth\nOf August was sixty eight years of age and yet the average age of a registered voter on the Harris County Paul's forty four years of age the average voter that showed up in the last mayor's race guess how old they were sixty two years of age so\nThe key thing and figuring out how to do a poll particularly if you're looking at opinion that matters voters is the first cigarette who's going to vote and that takes as much time I think is is writing in analyzing the ball second figure out what kind of medium are you going to talk to them on the phone are you going to recruit them to an Internet Paul are you going to\nSend them a robocall mix modes of voting increase the likelihood that you'll get a representative sample why someone your age and for your listeners you're considerably younger than I is probably not likely to have a landline phone not answered their cell phone when they don't know who it's from\nBut if I send you a text message about coming to a survey monkey website you're more likely to respond to that which means hard to reach voters young voters infrequent voters\nVoters of color motives of lower income or more likely to respond to a survey through a medium that is not traditional live telephone interviewing and Harris County is not only a real challenge but it's a useful challenge we are really what America is probably today which is racially ethnically and socially diverse\nWhere over half of our population barely half of our population owns Rome and another forty five to fifty percent rent which tells you what they move around a lot\nSo what else is a unique interesting challenging about trying to conduct polls here in the course get 'em right\nWell one is clearly language we are increasingly not only becoming a diversity in terms of race ethnicity but language we find that we can do as many as five or six percent of our interviews in Spanish and a variety of Asian languages\nLikely voters are not necessarily monolingual they're usually bilingual but doesn't mean that people don't feel comfortable and one of the things I did some years ago with a colleague was to see how people like to do their interviews in Spanish versus English\nAnd one of the things that have traditionally been the technique was if you got 'em Ramon Garcia you first said on the interview Hey Ron how would you like to do the interview and Spanish well if you think about that for a moment which I didn't when I was doing it that way is very off putting an insulting why would remain Garcia\nThat casual atmosphere is especially popular with younger shoppers and that's creating a problem for department stores that goes far beyond the makeup counter\nA lot of departments are traffic has traditionally been driven by cosmetics so if you don't have the consumer I'm going there for cosmetics and she's um she may not be going there at all\nSo Saks Fifth Avenue is trying to keep its customers by moving its beauty products off the main floor and combining them with spy services like facials an eyebrow shaping Nordstrom salespeople now handle multiple brands and Bloomingdales is reorganizing the forest out bringing a range of products together where they're easier to mix and match\nThat sixty five year old ... getting them make a lesson from a sales person at Bloomingdales\nWhen I'm here you know if I'm off\nDoing author a shopping then and there is something that I Know there\nShe just size like millions of other women and a growing number of men\nThe cosmetics industry brought in eighty six billion dollars in revenue last year and it's expected to top Ninety billion by twenty twenty social media and smaller startups are increasingly driving back wrote\nBarbers and more with the BP for cosmetics for lord and Taylor she says younger cosmetic shoppers don't just want products they won stories\nAnd these indie brands usually have the founder that can speak to why she or he created the brand why it's important to her and those stories are very important to the business today\nSo just being able to shop online last year on line makeup sales increased by nearly thirty percent banks that Instagram influences and celebrities like ... highly Jenner diners thirty dollar lip hits launched a billion dollar Internet
