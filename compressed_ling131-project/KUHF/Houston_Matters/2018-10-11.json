I was at a raising the price of a gallon of gas or something like forty five dollars a gallon or something when you places the amount of taxes that are involved if the tax single and the money that self in terms in terms of what is it carbon offsets all that is not going to happen politically it's just not\nUm it's you know it's it's I get the alarm I get being concerned about it but there has to be a practical angle and perhaps Trump ... make an argument that look here's a practical way for us to do this let's let's go for it this way and the whole my brass on Trump or anybody else in that for that\nThis programming it's ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the ... men story of requests for true laugh open season it restored we're them at the very Nineteen through November second Houston grand opera dot org\nShe provided um their stats that say everything on this issue on some stats say branches are\nEqual to refineries you know I don't know what is true and what is not true and I'm not a climatologist star [laughter] any of the ... or so but I Do not politically that we present a lot of\n... competitive arguments unless it's one\nOf the argument has been ... by the United states among others is developing countries that are spewing a tremendous amount of pollution that are not control the same way particularly state owned enterprises in places such as China or the Russian Federation India and elsewhere\nAnd so there's a real question of do you prevent these countries particularly China and India from developing themselves to middle class society is by telling them no you can't do what we did\nToo bad you're going to remain poor and that that becomes a real sticking point politically\nAs John alluded to this is not the only big news connected to the un in recent days on Tuesday we learned US ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley is resigning why she resigning\nThat's an open question in Washington right now there's there's river about and this is just remember about some sort of ethics issue related to meals travel and such sized planes\nUm she may have also just gotten tired of the fact that she was being a bit isolated I'm among the Trump top advisors\nI'm at the un the United states in general is relatively isolated which may which is a badge of honor to the Trump Administration but she might have founded exhausting I'm a Mark Sanford who was her protege and and and as governor of South Carolina was fact expressed surprise as well\nUm I don't buy the rumor that Nikki Haley is going to challenge trumping twenty twenty that's not going to happen\nI don't see that either and I do think that she probably wanted to take a break she's been in public service for ten straight ears and\nThe un job under the Trump Administration is part of bigger than it has been under some previous president but she's got to have some of the young kids to yeah that would be too but also I think you know Trump actually went two months without a departure [laughter]\nStupid or the dark and empty ... just for a little light and you'll get ...

higher it was just like instant celebrity\nOne of the points of some disagreement among the folks you interviewed is whether it's appropriate for people who do not have disabilities to portray characters who do or what's your take on that\nAs a filmmaker I Believe that if there is an opportunity\nTo cast a person with a disability for that role of a person with that same disability you should sometimes there's financial constraints based on\nThe budget in the film you need a lead actor who's already star to perform that\nPart right to you're forced to hire someone to act in yesterday when a lot of awards for those parts because it's a difficult job when it's done properly however it's important that we also give actors with disabilities opportunities to become stars to become like Peter ...\nPeople that are box office powerful enough where they can\nStart in in the movie and the only reason the only way to do that is if you give them parts and they build up their career unfortunately that's not happening at all\nPeople will be afraid to hire someone\nWith a disability because oh it might slow down production and our cost us money when that's not the case these are people that want to work and have the talent but if there's no employment opportunities how long are they gonna\nStick around if there's no outlet for their talent you know it doesn't have to be written\nAs a character with a disability I think actors with disabilities wanna play just anybody just like actors without disabilities can play someone with a disability it's about you know first

one night while recuperating in his hospital room he started watching a movie called the men starting Marlon Brando as an injured war veteran facing his future in a wheelchair\nMovie showed him coming back to the states and going through rehabilitation and ramming into barriers that were just unbelievable and and I had never considered bad and I never\nUnderstood the implications of my own industry is Ruth ... a month after I had broken my neck nobody had really ever told me that I was going to face barriers as a person with a disability I knew that I Would probably have a disability the rest of my life because I've broken my back\nMy spinal cord was injured and the doctor told me that I was probably going to use a wheelchair but the barriers that faced people with disabilities really occurred to me and I saw that movie and it was striking\nThe movie actually has a happy ending but I never got to the ending of the movie I cried myself to sleep at night I had I seen the end of the movie I'm not sure what to change my attitude that really put me in kind of a depression I couldn't explain to people the doctors and my family anybody for a few days\nOut of the movie had affected me

the the one I remember best was a iron sides iron sides had an impact on everybody I think in our society who watched it\nIron sides was about the this uh attorney and I guess he was actually a police chief of the time who had a band that was a usable by a person with a wheelchair and he\nThe cool thing about ... said he did his job and he didn't let the disability the wheelchair interfere with his job he managed to\nFigure out ways around barriers they did not ignore the barriers but I'm a he figured out ways to get up and down or using ramp some alternative methods for uh lifting the wheelchair and the other thing that I thought it was really cool about aren't sides\nIs that while people his staff sometimes is a subordinate\nOften tried to protect him he asserted himself and did his job despite that is the you know I I may use a wheelchair but I can still do my job and that was a profound I think that was really a good portrayal [noise]\nTo get those records last night yeah

film and TV over the years that you're like oh that's so uh so tired or inaccurate or done\nNow that I mean the most often you know the thing you see most often that\nI find really amusing you say you know seldom do characters who have disabilities really run into real life barriers\nIt seems like they always you know there's always a pathway ahead that a bright and cheerful and charming and they

trying to think about how is this going to be a good investment over the next twenty five fifty years\nSentiments Burke says parking needs are changing because how people get around is changing\nAs rail expands in Houston, Texas as you have more people using over and live and perhaps autonomous driving vehicles in the near future near future being a decade\nA decade for building is not very long and what's the sweet spot of what should a developer investor do and what should have been this power they require\nDid you find it difficult finding his base when you were coming here this morning\nI got lucky that the mayor pro tem Alan Cohen she's also the council member for districts see she says he didn't like other cities have their share of parking issues and managing the growing population if something they're thinking about\nWe have to figure out ways to get cars off the streets we have to be able to bring people in his done by methods in buses light rail integrated transportation how can we do that\nThat people are driving cars with one person behind the wheel\nBut Karlan says regulations have been changing we instead of\nHaving regulations requiring restaurants for example to have X number of spaces available were piloting the idea which is president going on downtown\nBut in midtown where you don't have to have X number of parking spaces you come to the restaurant you can park on the adjoining streets you know that type of thing\nFor years the city of Houston who said no parking restrictions in downtown Houston uh we've let the market answer to that\nAgain if the chief development officer for the city of Houston He changes in development have led to changes in parking needs\nOr someone has built a new multifamily project in midtown that owner told me he is he found about a third of his his residents in this new apartment didn't have a car at all\nNot having a car maybe a growing trend in Houston it can point to a development near the Galleria\nHouston has evolved in many places to mix use development the Galleria area which is over thirty five million square feet one third of it as commercial office space one third as residential and when they are to disinfect retail space that does require less cars if people want to go in that area\n... says another factor is technology\nAutonomous vehicles are going to play a role longer term uh we're looking at some experimental work on a tunnel must vehicle going from the convention center to the airports\nAll of these will take time the technology needs to be improved but it's changing every day and I think it's up to us to look at how we would accommodate that\nAnd in the coming years it could mean big changes in a city where at the moment so many people drive themselves\nNewsworthy sevens Allison

it but she did interview him and she joins us now I'm at ... high crack a despite these glaring omissions what sort of research did spits due for Reagan an American journey well\nHe spent more than five years conducting hundreds of interviews\nFor the book the end result it's this massive eight hundred eighty page biography that covers everything from Reagan's childhood as fast as a sports caster it's Hollywood career and admittedly mostly forget about roles and ultimately his entry into politics\nPresident Reagan's political career alone was fascinating he wasn't always the conservative figure that we knew during his years in the\nWhite House no he was a longtime Democrat actually who backed FDR but over time he's sort of converted into a conservative Republican I asked ... about that yesterday before his world affairs council of Houston event last night I spit told me how Reagan's political transformation began\nWell he had been shifting for ah for quite a long time as his career in Hollywood dwindled\nHe found a new job or he became spokesperson for General Electric corporation\nAnd he was on TV is the host of their uh Sunday night drama anthology but the other part of that job was to be jeeze ambassador and what he did it in that respect was that he traveled around the country to all the big G. plants worth thousands of people were employed\nJust to talk to their workers to see what was on their mind or to have to know what was going on with their families how they saw the world\nHe always said that that was the greatest job he ever had and I I\nTend to believe he's probably felt that way he really did and what he heard from these people was what you know a lot of the middle class had said in the last election that they were being ignored the working class they felt they were being taken advantage of by the government there were things too many taxes\nAnd and these were all things that affected Reagan deeply because people told them their sob stories and they played on his heart strings\nAnd if you played on Ronald Reagan's heartstrings he really took it to heart and so his politics gradually began to shift against big government against big taxes all the things that really were the bedrock of conservatism\nBut do you think the empathy also played back to his own childhood of of having an alcoholic father as you write it out of having to move constantly and and it just having this very up and down a time growing up\nYour you know he always felt that he had to pull himself up by his own bootstraps he had a a complete rags to riches story and I think you're right that was definitely a part of it but when he was a child to his father was a classic result Republican\nThe only Democrat in an all Republican town and Reagan really grew up hearing to democratic principles a union or we spoke about the working man the people who were hard pressed\nAbout when a when the government began to take his own tax money Reagan began to
