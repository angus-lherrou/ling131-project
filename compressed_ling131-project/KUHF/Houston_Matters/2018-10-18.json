{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "First here's what Senator Cruz have to say\nWell is it of course the climate is changing the climate has been changing from the dawn of time to climate will change as long as we have a planet earth\nI'm I Am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers\nI Believe in science I share the science in space subcommittee in the Senate Commerce Committee and indeed in that capacity I chaired a hearing looking on the science and data\nBehind global warming and we heard testimony we heard actual science and data far too many Democrats approach this issue not as a matter of science I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence but instead what they approach it as as a matter of government power and they want the power to control the economy\nThat Senator Cruz last night he also said his opponent voted in favor of a ten dollar a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in Texas in response congressmen work borrowed a nickname President Trump used to mock crews and the twenty sixteen Republican primaries\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you he's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever take is dishonest why the president called on line to and that's why the nickname stuff because it's for\nAll right what's your take on this particular back and forth between the crews and congressman O'Rourke well\nOn the Exxon Mobil question that was one to send a cruise dodged a in the sense that he didn't want to address the point of Exxon Mobil winking and climate change to manmade actions I sort of took the out of climate change is occurring with cancer but science isn't good enough to tell us what proportion is manmade and what proportion is not\nA so in that sense he dodge the question buddy effectively Perry did in the sense that most people ended up thinking about sort of that he agreed with the idea of science that he wasn't serving the FARC camp that denies climate change yet he just was sort of waiting until the jury's out\nWhat about this ten dollar a barrel tax quite well\nNow you know that was a resolution that a congressman did vote on I mean if it was sort of more symbolic than anything else a bike\nI I think it it's just so I just one of those points that Cruz has a point in that technically overworked voted for it but on the other hand it wasn't really actually a vote to increase taxes increase a ten dollar tax that would have actually passed\nThis climate change something that a historically has been an issue that has influenced voters one way or another\nWell I think it influences motors on a level of policy I think there's clearly a partisan divide on it\nOn what to do about it uh as far as last night I think when Ted Cruz said climate change is a fact it is a fact I don't think Republicans really disagree with that and I I think a lot of times the debate is whether or not climate change is actually occurring\nIt is occurring I think almost everyone agrees with that now the ... as mark was talking about the the issue is how much is our human activity that part of that climate change and the degree to which it is is is you know is a political issue and I think a lot of times the public has a very difficult time\nAre deciding okay how much of an issue is is how much are we actually affecting the climate ourself with our behavior and so forth so uh it would be nice if we can somehow gets ... to get something more definitive than a politician going back and forth on this\nFar well I think and then also going back to the Exxon Mobil after Exxon Mobil is a political organization as well so they often put out things served to deflect criticism about climate change but then they go on pumping oil producing natural gas and essentially contributing to manmade climate change\nOr work on that on ... on that issue he said it's a fact basically that the science tells us this a first science doesn't give you ... we do a a an analysis\nThis program ... by Houston grand opera presenting Wagner is the ... men story of requests for

O. U. meteorologist Brooks garner Brookes welcome to Houston matters\nThank you very much good afternoon what a pleasure to be here\nWe welcome any questions or comments that you have about winter weather in Houston are really about anything related to meteorology at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can email us talk at Houston matters dot org and of course\nYou can also reach out to Houston matters on Twitter or Facebook this really is late or for our first genuine cold snap right\nIt's true usually Houston will see the first fifties at the end of September so we're running a good three weeks behind of do so today we're seeing temperatures about sixty two degrees that also represents our average high temperature during the coldest month of the entire year\nAnd that's January so between January third in January seventh our typical high temperature for Houston and sixty two and that's where we are today so we've gone from the heat of summer I call it ... it to the absolute refrigerator that is used in the winter and it really is with the humidity\nIt feels a certain kind of cold it's that that damp cold but it gets you reading the bones\nIt's like we went from August to January overnight just like that in a snap a it would also seem we've wasted no time with this temperature drop have we had record low high temperatures this week\nIn fact we have yesterday was one of those days and it actually broke a record that was said just after the turn of the last century so I mean these are very old records high temps in the low sixties when the previous record high temperatures were close to sixty six sixty seven degrees today is going to be no different\nThe record lowest high for this date was set back in Nineteen Nineteen and it was sixty seven degrees so as of now we're about to shatter\nFor the coldest October the seventeenth we've ever seen in the recorded history Houston\nWe're entering an El Nino year ah remind us what El Nino and la anemia or what to do and\nSo if you've ever watched the popular Chris Farley Saturday Night live skit you know what El Nino as but no it's only India but in this case El Nino is the warming the anomalous warming of the eastern editorial Pacific waters\nAnd learning as the opposite it's the unusual cooling of those waters off of Ecuador in the west coast of South America and while it's far away there are interesting whether tele connections as they're known where seemingly unrelated systems ultimately are completely hand in hand in producing our daily weather\nSo last winter we were in a week ... and when that happens we typically see the jet stream going a little bit farther north and that leads to what can be warmer winters now that said we had some cold lasts last winter but if you remember February of twenty Eighteen was quite warm we bounce back in the seventies and eighties\nSo as you mentioned this winter looks to be an El Nino currently it's not we're in what's called an end zone neutral that's the\nUh the El Nino southern oscillation the academic into so right now we're neither El Nino ... to slip into that El Nino\nAnd when that happens the jet stream goes a little bit farther south it's a little bit stronger in Houston's winters are a little bit wetter and a little bit cooler and if they get a little bit cooler than wetter than they become a lot more snow\nAnd Houston has seen its share of snow although it is rare did you know an Eighteen Ninety five twenty inches of snow fell in Houston really can you imagine twenty inches of snow that's nearly two feet\nI I Can't in in any regard imagine ... stony world of Houston that we know being able to comprehend that I mean I grew up in the mid west and I've lived up in northeast of ... you know Pennsylvania and so I'm used to white out blizzards and that sort of thing\nBut I couldn't I couldn't fathom it here I mean I saw last year when we had that ice storm would yeah it was a dusting of ice but it really did stop this city and its track\nIt did and keep in mind that Eighteen Ninety five we're a city of horse and buggy [laughter] it was a smaller place today that would that would shut us down for a week or more and it would result in so many problems now I'm not calling for that this winter in fact I have no idea how much they're going to have this winter\nBut judging by last winter when we had five snow falls a either a trace or a tenth of an inch or half an inch\nI mean that's a lot more than Houston would normally see now this winter if we do have a little more precipitation at all and it is a little bit cooler than normal\nWe would certainly be in danger at least the threats on for a higher chance for ice events like freezing rain or even maybe some so what's the earliest it's ever snowed here so that's a really good question the earliest snow and this is something that on this October the seventeenth is actually a little bit\nDisarming it's surprising forty eight days from now will be December the fourth forty eight days from now and that marks the earliest snow that's ever fall in Houston that happened back in two thousand nine\nSo while we're catching a little bit of a cruel south right now it's only a few more weeks before we really could be in that zone of possible wintry weather\nSo we among other things we do of course need to keep an eye on when that occurs and when we close in on that first freeze\nBecause that's something that you know uh our gardens aren't prepared for our crops aren't prepared for our buildings aren't necessarily insulated for I mean these are all things that we think about here that's that's different from other parts of the country\nAnd you're so right about the insulation considering the during our coldest week of here that is generally third through generate eighth or average high if you look at the climate normal sixty two with average low forty three that's well above freezing so the insulation would be rated accordingly\nIn while Houston doesn't usually experienced extreme winter weather there have been times that we have seen wild temperature swings like do you remember were you here I was not but Nineteen eighty nine I was not huge Arctic outbreak Bush intercontinental airport reached a low of seven degrees\nYou're on December twenty third downtown Houston even colder than that back in Nineteen thirty reached a low of five degrees\nSo if we ever saw anything that low in this modern day beyond pipes freezing people would be experiencing suits serious problems in their homes or discomfort the least of those problems just for reference last year if you remember those tropical gardeners experienced so much damage from the cold snaps we did see\nWe only experienced freezing conditions five times this past winter twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen\nWhich doesn't seem like much five times but one of those times we got down to Nineteen degrees\nAnd it wasn't just a column Nineteen degrees it was a window driven Nineteen degree so even if you covered up those tropical plants the hope feel in danger of for instance or the bottle brushes\nThey still got Bert sometimes killed I can I tell you how many Sago palm trees and my little area of ... for instance hello ... got ... got birds and they're still recovering today\nSo that was a low temperature of Nineteen degrees\nIf in this El Nino pattern the jet stream dips a little bit farther south who's to say we don't see even colder weather\nYou mentioned pipes and they can burst and uh the the lack of insulation and this is something that is different from other parts of the country so if you're a new ... stony and uh and haven't been in this climate before when the temperature dips down\nAt or below freezing one of the things that people ask you to do around here is open up all those cabinet doors\nAre going to go to the heat it led to the pipes because we don't typically have any insulation on any of our pipes and not just in that spot underneath the sink but all the way through the the whole piping system\nVery true and especially in the homes built before the Nineteen nineties where the codes were a little bit different and you're absolutely right and and we we can laugh about it now because we're well above freezing but when it does get down into the the teens and twenties especially for more than several hours\nThe ... are are very real problem and it can cost a lot of money a couple of thousand dollars not to mention the water damage if you're not home when it happens to run up to the street and shut the water down\nI mentioned the ice storm from last winter or earlier and there's a great example of something that if you are coming from northern climes you may have been really puzzled by how\nThat shut down the city but we actually had public officials saying please stay home and the whole point is\nWe don't really have a way to deal with ice on a roadway on a bridge other than to just close the ... of the road or the bridge until it melts\nYes and and look I'm not complaining about that because our our\nPeople supported me but it ... ... and also as dangerous to yeah and and so my wife was set up time was set up right at least so she said look make a choice you could do\nDo you want to do [laughter] but your wife [laughter]\n[laughter] ... [laughter] and that's the way up and I don't have any ... and I don't have any ... bottles\nSo this is an I've been wondering about this for a long time the expression woke which is you know it's really really like managers are saying you know you've been saying wake up and all so that's what I was going to ask you since Nineteen\nI think\nI said it is in school does definitely definitely in and it ... it definitely in school days that's set over and over and school day so I was wondering like there's a will come from from school days I mean\nI'm a outlook I don't know where it came from I just know we'd go was first\nDo you still love making movies\nYes our love make movies even up to it 'cause I'm loving them no now let me break it down to you okay cause us to be in my uh my of soup

to leave that district\nBut for those of us who are here we have to have hope that's what education\nThat's the hallmark of education is hoping control\nAnd getting our entire system through a very difficult days of informing colleagues that they have no job that's one of the ways that you give people hope because then the sun gets to come up on the other side we get to love on the people that

if the if we're losing bet real estate as well\nRight oh we my Research Center we've been working with the ... by use communities that have flooded three years in a row and they still are valued is neighborhoods this is part of that preservation discussion so while back at a conference I made a a bit of a tongue in cheek\nStory this was before\nWe had a bad hurricane and I talked about protecting the Mad Men belt so if you look at historically where we developed and he's a lot easier as they're flooding us in the Nineteen fifty four annexation ring around the city Sheila other sixty slab on grade\nThe sunset patio homes from the sixties this gorgeous mid century\nA modern architecture but they're built somewhere where it floods there's been subsidence\nAnd then the next ... more water and so they're they're really wrestling on what is going to happen what does is what the whole neighborhoods looked like when we add a ... we lift them a story 'cause that's what we'll have to do it's a very different kind of neighborhood at that point\nBut Marlon always after every event\nIt declined in terms of this resale value but it always came back and they came back faster and stronger than the rest of the Houston these are neighborhoods people value because it really planned neighborhoods\nWe should take a clue from that we look at new neighborhoods in Houston to think about how we actually plan those neighbors and not just a collection of developments\nWhat are some of the other factors for success how do we do all this population growth will\nWell certainly if you start looking at the analysis worked is already happened\nBy age ... she has their livable cities study this they've done a fight over two dozen opportunities for pedestrian transit oriented
