other organizations that we\nWork with feel the same way as we too but this is completely and totally unnecessary\nAnd that the people that are here are not burden to society which\nIs completely wrong they're here they're productive citizens they're working they don't have health insurance and they they need access to health care and by threatening to withhold their citizenship which is something they want for threatening to not renew their green card to me it's cruel it's\nCompletely and totally unnecessary\nWhen you talk about patients who are concerned or are hesitant to use the

on us the tax payers\nOn because they still do not have health insurance and they'll be so much thicker and costs so much more than if they would and should do what they're doing now which is come in for their preventive care and their routine care\nAnd access to their medication et cetera and it's much more cost effective to do it that way than if they go to mark and see what and\nHow has a

degrees eighty seven percent relative humidity at the University of Houston the pulse\nThis evening eight pm on news eighty eight seven seven twenty three\nWe spent the last several months introducing you to various candidates for office discussing issues of significance leading up to the mid term elections we've talked about political strategy and the balance of power and local state and federal government but there are more basic questions that need answering before you vote like\nA they had been playing in the Texas lake before that but with a variety of different names a mutt cats being the one that was most popular because hey we had a lot of mud\nSo make perfect sense a we think today of major league franchises as having these deeply developed farm systems and I guess branch Rickey was one of the the early developers of that concept but when you go back to the earliest days of Houston baseball\nTeams like the Buffalo's affiliated with any other teams or any other leagues it's possible\nThat the Buffalo's were the first real farm team in America or anywhere for that matter [noise] we're not exactly sure but branch Rickey is the guy that really settled at up he was the general manager of the cardinals and we're talking immediately following World War one and the ...\nIt's ... association that ran major league baseball did not allow a farm teams they did not want to major league team owning a minor league team the Texas League also did not want to major league team owning defects league team\nAnd branch Rickey was doing all this under the table and even after the national association made it legal the Texas leagues still had an illegal so he's doing this on the sly ah he had straw owners if you will here in Houston or John ... was a friend of his that started a quicker Fulbright Jaworski that a law firm\nAnd um so he's kind of overseeing the team for branch Rickey and the cardinals and it finally all came out uh in the early twenties\nAnd the Buffalo's went to the Texas League and said hey\nWe're sorry but in return for building a brand new stadium will let the cardinals continue to own us what do you think about that ... said fine [laughter] oh Houston got a brand new stadium and it turned out that the Fort Worth cats have been operating under a similar situation of ... and ... yeah\nIt it's amazing how rules are sacrosanct until well suddenly there's a new stadium\nInvolved exact [laughter] uh\nThis actually takes us the right to a question I had four year which is about notable players\nFor the Buffalo's over the years if the Buffalo's were a part of that farm system that early farm system the cardinals the first name that comes to mind for me it usually always comes to mind for me when we talk about baseball stand musical\nMutual never played here although he had ties to Houston ... what sort of ties friendships long term friendships with different people er Dickie Kerr a is one of them and he was a guy if you think back to the Nineteen Nineteen black Sox a Dickie ... the guy that did not take money are among the pitchers\nOh right there was one of the game what was going to say he was the one that sort of kept them in it yeah young pitcher at the time\nWas an absolutely and he ended up living in Houston for a long time and there was a even a statue of him that are still around that floating around I think last I heard uh skaters might have had it out in a sugar land but I'm not sure where it is now\nBut he became very good friends with a mutual so there were ties to Houston a dizzy dean is without a doubt the most famous guy that ever played for the boss\nHe was here for about a year and a half and I think it's impossible to say that anybody in the history of Houston sports ever caught the imagination of the town more than dizzy dean did\nTo give you an idea when he got married which was here in Houston or they did it at buffs stadium at home plate\nUm ballplayers with bats like a like sword yeah likes or the love them that they would walk through exactly course I'm his ... and a best man we're the three sports editors from the major newspapers that's how much they love dizzy dean because he was an endless source a copy\nAnd just to give people a sense when you're saying those sorts of copy what kind of a personality was he\nThe guy was just bigger than life is a phrase that gets overused a lot but he really was they played afternoon games usually starting around three o'clock sometimes he'd show up at two you know or to thirty right before the game is starting and go out there and throw a three hitter a complete game\nUm he just seemed to dominate everybody up but he also had this incredible sense of humor he was\nConstantly going out and spend the money is very generous he would hit up the cardinals ball club for advances on his salary he was playing I think it was in Fort Worth as a matter of fact\nHe's playing one time and he's having a pretty good game he hit a home run and that was the only run and then he got into trouble they fell behind in the manager comes out to pull dizzy dean and instead of walking in toward the dugout he walks out to the outfield goes up to that hand operated stadium and pulls the one represents his home run\nOff of the scoreboard and he says if I'm going to my home runs coming with [noise]\nThe bus played at buff stadium what can you tell us about that ballpark\nThere was actually three places that the bus played um the first one was that ... a gallon and then in Nineteen oh five they moved to west in park which is underneath appears elevated right now and then in Nineteen twenty seven\nUm they moved over at the end of that season two buff stadium which is just a few blocks from where we are on the other side of the Gulf freeway\nA big ballpark a interestingly enough center field was for thirty six I think which is about exactly what minute maid was to centerfield when it opened up\nAt my right to say that was the site of the first major league night game\nNo oh no major league they would have been in the Texas legal in the Texas um and it wasn't the first it was very early I'm actually the first night games where with portable lights and the Kansas City monarchs which was a a negro league team were the first ones to travel around and bring their lights with them so they claim night games\nBut in case nobody's noticed as it gets really hot here\nAnd so the idea of playing games at nighttime instead of at three in the afternoon\nEverybody in the Texas League with I think maybe one exception of embrace night games before the major leagues did\nHe mentioned the negro leagues before the major leagues were integrated were their negro league teams here in Houston or did they play here\nFor ... there was a negro league team here what the national press refers to as the negro leagues is the negro National League and what was called the eastern colored lead that later became the negro American League\nAnd they're all in the Midwest and the northeast\nAnd after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball a major league baseball the negro leagues started very rapidly going downhill and the Newark Eagles that had been one of the main stays in the eastern league\nThey were losing money and so they got sold and they played here for two seasons ah forty eight forty nine and I'm Sorry to forty nine and fifty anyway then\nThey weren't making money here either they moved to New Orleans very briefly and then disbanded\nYou mentioned ah eastern teams Midwestern teams are not just in those leagues but in the major leagues that's where a lot of those teams were located going back a century\nOr the same I think could be said for women's baseball or what we know what we remember from the movie a league of their own or has to do with a league that was started up during World War two primarily though in mid western cities and maybe a few in the east uh did any of that filtered down here to Houston\nWell there was actually accused only in that played in that league or the all American professional\nIt's baseball league um and her name was Murray Mahoney achievement by red and there were three Texans I think to from the San Antonio area and then read Mahoney from Houston and she just passed away a couple of years ago and just a fantastic woman just\nTo give you an idea read was maybe Ninety One and I had stopped over interviewed her a couple of times and we became friends and I\nHad stopped by to see her and I said how you doing she goes oh not not very well at all she goes on my back got hurt and I can only play golf two or three times a week [laughter] woman's Ninety One but yeah she went on to the uh played it I think in South bend in Peoria or\nPlaces like that I'm Phillip Wrigley was really one of the organizers behind that league and that's why they're all kind of bounced around Chicago and Michigan in Wisconsin in that area\nIn the past year in Houston matters we talked about Mexican Americans influence on Houston's baseball history what can you share about that\nHouston was never and this is not just baseball but Houston and don't get me wrong I'm not saying that Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants were\nAccepted on an equal playing field but there was never the codified segregation in the city of Houston that you got elsewhere\nOr San Antonio for example had an entire league that was just Mexican American baseball teams and in Houston it was much more integrated but there were still some teams that were made up of primarily Mexican American players\nMost famous was the one that played for southern select beer\nAnd this would have been in the forties probably all all the way into the fifties and at the time semi pro baseball because we had no major leagues semi pro baseball was as big as you got I mean sometimes it got bigger headlines than the buffs the minor league team did\nAnd southern select was one of the top teams made up almost entirely of Mexican American players and they had a big following I mean the of the Mexican leagues were flourishing at the time it was probably the high point of a Mexican League baseball and the Mexican Americans that we're in Houston were caught up in baseball bigtime\nSemi pro is big back then was college baseball is big in Houston as it is today\nNot as big as it is um the semi pro leagues every major company and even the minor ones had baseball teams that representative was advertising but when you got up to the big companies that was bragging rights\nSo shell a humble oil Houston lighting and power a grand prize beer southern select beer those were the ones that they they paid guys\nAs with anything Eleanor you have to wonder where she found the time to be a regular magazine columnist in addition to among other things writing her syndicated newspaper column cold my day\nHolding weekly White House press conferences traveling around the country on behalf of new deal programs and answering some estimated one hundred and thirty thousand letters a year\nAs first lady the America that emerges through this Twenty

seems like the product of a work of speculative fiction [noise]\nImagine being a young woman in Nineteen forty nine and feeling that it was okay to write to Eleanor Roosevelt to ask do girls who refused to neck ever get married\nOr the Nineteen year old boy in Nineteen forty six who's all ready a veteran of World War two who asks Eleanor if he's too young to marry his sweetheart\nEleanor uncharacteristically waffle on that one\nAlthough she was by nature and upbringing emotionally reticent Eleanor sometimes responded to the genuine need of her questioners with an openness that was rare than and almost unimaginable now\nIn Nineteen fifty four Eleanor received this letter that reads my sister eats her heart out about mistake she made bringing up her oldest boy\nShe thinks you are in great woman Mrs Roosevelt and I wish you could tell her a few mistakes you think you made when your children were growing up\nEleanor rode along response that in part contain these raw admissions I gave in and allowed one of my sons to be sent to boarding school I did not have the courage to fight the family tradition it was a serious mistake on my part\nI did too little for my three older children personally when they were babies\nAs trivial a cultural artifact as an advice column may seem to be Eleanor is if you ask me columns revealed multitudes about the extraordinary relationship she forged with her fellow Americans of all races young and old\nThere's something very democratic about this twenty plus year monthly conversation of sorts that Eleanor conducted on the pages of popular women's magazines people felt they had a right to contact Eleanor and she felt she had a responsibility to respond\nAnd all those seriousness with her hallmark as an advice columnist I also get the feeling that writing these columns and consequently being more connected to the lives of everyday Americans gave Eleanor great joy\nMarine Corps again teaches literature at Georgetown

year us manufacturers support the pullout saying the agreement is outdated in the age of e commerce\nThe administration says it will take twelve months to formally withdraw and in the meantime it's

Committee and indeed in that capacity I chaired herring looking on the science and data but high\nIn global warming and we heard testimony we heard actual science and data far too many Democrats approach to this issue not as a matter of science I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence but instead what they approach it as as a matter of government power and they want the power to control the economy\nThat Senator Cruz last night he also said his opponent voted in favor of a ten dollar a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in Texas in response congressmen work borrowed a nickname President Trump used to mock crews and the twenty sixteen Republican primaries\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you here going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or ever take his dishonest why the president called on line to and that's why the nickname stuff because it's\nAll right what's your take on this particular back and forth between Santa Cruz and congressman O'Rourke\nWell on the Exxon Mobil question that was one the sender cruise dodged a in the sense that he didn't want to address the point of Exxon Mobil linking climate change to manmade actions I sort of took the out of climate change is occurring with cancer but science isn't good enough to tell us what proportion is manmade and what proportion is not\nA so in that sense he dodge the question buddy effectively Perry did in the sense that most people ended up thinking about sort of that he agreed with the idea of science that he wasn't serving the FARC camp that denies climate change yet he just was sort of waiting till the jury's out\nWhat about this ten dollar a barrel tax claim\nOn that you know that was a resolution that a congressman did vote on I mean if it was sort of more symbolic than anything else a by\nI think it's just so I just one of those points that Cruz has a point in that technically the overworked voted for it but on the other hand it wasn't really actually a vote to increase taxes increase of ten dollar tax that would have actually passed\nThis climate change something that a historically has been an issue that has influenced voters one way or another\nWell I think it influences motors on a level of policy I think there's clearly a partisan divide on it\nOn what to do about it but as far as last night I think when Ted Cruz said climate change is the fact it is a fact I don't think Republicans really disagree with that and I I think a lot of times the debate is whether or not climate changes actually occurring\nIt is occurring and I think almost everyone agrees with that now the ... as mark was talking about the the issue is how much is our human activity that part of that climate change and the degree to which it is is is you know is a political issue and I think a lot of times the public has a very difficult time\nAre deciding okay how much of an issue is is how much are we actually affecting the climate ourself with our behavior and so forth so uh\nIt would be nice if we can somehow gets ... to get something more definitive than a politician going back and forth on this\nFor well I think and then also going back to the Exxon Mobil after Exxon Mobil is a political organization as well so they often put out things served to deflect criticism about climate change but then they go on pumping oil producing natural gas and essentially contributing to ban the climate change\nO'Rourke on that on the on that issue he said it's a fact basically that the science tells us this a first science doesn't give you ... we do a a an analysis and we'd have meat basically on this correlation\nAnalysis to sell it to see how much the effect is in comparison to what our behavior is and the correlation is there it's just a matter of of the magnitude of it and whether or not that correlation is actually a really a causation a factor there\nI suspect we may have a caller to they want to come back to that the that issue and we'll get to it but let's move on to\nFor the moment to another issue that ah the two candidates clashed over a aid for Harvey recovery congressmen work was asked about his vote against a bill that would have given some tax relief to residents affected by Harvey here's what he said\nA voter for more than a hundred and thirty six billion dollars in aid to support those communities who have been hit by natural disasters including Harvey and in a specific bill that you asked about the the tax relief was not as great as we've seen for those who have been through other natural disasters I thought we can get a better deal\nOn the same as you said Cruz touted his record in the Senate\nIn the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills\n\nOkay when it comes to Harvey recovery David random ah first of all who do you think has the strongest case for voters\n[noise] uh I don't think either one has the strongest case so to speak I think I'm that old work was in support of Harvey relief he was there I think Ted Cruz was clearly in support of Harvey relief some relief himself his problem was that he wasn't necessarily in favor of release relief in previous instances\nWhere non Harvey uh incidents occurred for instance in in the in the northeast when they had storm up there\nThey had a lot of damage up there and he was hesitant to give a relief so he wasn't he wasn't able to put himself in a position to a demand such relief it in in a way to maybe ...\n... well yeah I think with Hurricane Sandy in particular what singer crews and many Republicans objected to was northeast Democrats turn it into a Christmas tree and essentially adding\nThings to Sandy relief that had nothing really to do is Sandy itself infrastructure projects but that did create some bad\nWill among many politicians in the northeast who dust in the case of Harvey were less likely to essentially play ball and since a lot of Texas to get their share hardly relate so there are consequences on on the other hand if you're against the deficit that went under Cruz was doing was at least you agree with that\nLet's take another call Roberts in South west Houston Robert what's your question or comment\nA so I'm a little I'm a I'm a little confused about a freshman Republican stance on climate change now\nSo they would read by this point that it actually is happening but say it's not man I mean what the shot them that are they suggest that humanity basically just\nHave to wait ... hundred years from their supply breaking down and whatever that which are colonized another planet Earth like conditions like talking before he died or what exactly are they getting\nOkay thanks for the call to the question mark\nWell I I think probably you can look at it from two perspectives from a more\nI think straightforward perspective you're given the benefit of the doubt\nThe dispute is on the extent to which climate change is manmade is it a hundred percent Ninety percent eighty percent Seventy percent and if so what are the remedies and how do you balance the remedies versus the cost of doing it for there are costs so like in California when you add solar panels to houses that\nIncreases the cost of housing that's if you give a sort of the favorable point of view\nThe but they more skeptical or unfavorable view would be viewpoint would be that that's just a dodge to avoid doing anything and that in the end of you wants to support industries support the energy industry and allow that to occur and not really think about the future so depends if you're going to give them the benefit of the doubt or not but give them the benefit of the doubt\nIf you missed last night's

O. U. meteorologist Brooks garner Brookes welcome to Houston matters\nThank you very much good afternoon what a pleasure to be here\nWe welcome any questions or comments that you have about winter weather in Houston are really about anything related to meteorology at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy you can email us talk at Houston matters dot org and of course\nYou can also reach out to Houston matters on Twitter or Facebook this really is late ... uh for our first genuine cold snap right\nIt's true usually Houston will see the first fifties at the end of September so we're running a good three weeks behind\nOf note though today we're seeing temperatures about sixty two degrees that also represents our average high temperature during the coldest month of the entire year and that's January\nSo between January third in January seventh our typical high temperature for Houston sixty two and that's where we are today so we've gone from the heat of summer I call a dog's breath it to the absolute refrigerator that is used in the winter and it really is with the humidity\nIt feels a certain kind of cold and damp cold that it gets you read in the bones\nIt's like we went from August to January overnight\nJust like that in a snack\nOr it would also seem we've wasted no time with this temperature drop have we had record low high temperatures this week\nIn fact we have yesterday was one of those days and it actually broke a record that was said just after the turn of the last century so I mean these are very old records high temps in the low sixties when the previous record high temperatures were close to sixty six in sixty seven degrees today is going to be no different\nThe record lowest high for this date was set back in Nineteen Nineteen and it was sixty seven degrees so as of now we're about to shatter\nFor the coldest October the seventeenth we've ever seen in the recorded history Houston\nWe're entering an El Nino year or remind us what El Nino and La Nina or what to ...\nSo if you've ever watched the popular Chris Farley Saturday Night live skit you know what El Nino as but no it don't India but in this case El Nino is the warming the anomalous warming of the eastern editorial Pacific waters\nAnd listening as the opposite it's the unusual cooling of those waters off of Ecuador in the west coast of South America\nAnd while it's far away there are interesting whether tele connections as they're known where seemingly unrelated systems ultimately or completely hand in hand in producing our daily weather\nSo last winter we were in a week ... and when that happens we typically see the jet stream going a little bit farther north and that leads to what can be warmer winters now that said we had some cold lasts last winter but if you remember February of twenty Eighteen was quite warm we bounce back in the seventies and eighties\nSo as you mentioned this winter looks to be in El Nino currently it's not we're in what's called an end zone neutral that's the uh the El Nino southern oscillation the acronyms ... so right now we're neither El Nino or ... or expected to slip into that El Nino\nAnd when that happens the jet stream goes a little bit further south is a little bit stronger in Houston's winters are a little bit wetter and a little bit cooler and if they get a little bit cooler than wetter than they become a lot more snow\nAnd Houston has seen its share of snow although it is rare did you know an Eighteen Ninety five twenty inches of snow fell in Houston really can you imagine twenty inches of snow that's nearly two feet\nI I Can't in in any regard imagine ... stony world of Houston that we know being able to comprehend that I mean I grew up in the Midwest and I've lived up in northeast of Pennsylvania and so I'm used to white out blizzards and that sort of thing\nBut I couldn't I couldn't fathom it here I mean I saw last year when we had that ice storm which was a dusting of ice but it really did stop this city and its track\nDid and keep in mind that Eighteen Ninety five we're a city of horse and buggy [laughter] it was much smaller place today that would that would shut us down for a week or more and it would result in so many problems now I'm not calling for that this winter in fact I have no idea how much do we're going to have this winter\nBut judging by last winter when we had five snow falls a either a trace or a tenth of an inch or half an inch\nI mean that's a lot more than Houston would normally see now this winter if we do have a little more precipitation than normal and it is a little bit cooler than normal\nWe would certainly be in danger or at least the threats on for a higher chance for ice events like freezing rain or even maybe some so what's the earliest it's ever stowed here so that's a really good question the earliest snow and this is something that on this October the seventeenth is actually a little bit\nDisarming it's surprising forty eight days from now will be December the for forty eight days from now and that marks the earliest snow that's ever fall in Houston that happened back in two thousand nine\nSo while we're catching a little bit of a cruel stuff right now it's only a few more weeks before we really could be in that zone of possible wintry weather\nSo we among other things we do of course you need to keep an eye on when that occurs and when we close in on that first freeze\nBecause that's something that you know uh our gardens aren't prepared for our crops aren't prepared for our buildings aren't necessarily insulated for I mean these are all things that we think about here that's that's different from other parts of the country\nAnd you're so right about the insulation considering the during our coldest week of the earth that is generally third through generate eighth or average high if you look at the climate normal sixty two with average low forty three that's well above freezing so the insulation would be rated accordingly\nIn well Houston doesn't usually experience extreme winter weather there have been times that we have seen wild temperature swings like do you remember ... I was not but Nineteen eighty nine I was not huge Arctic outbreak Bush intercontinental airport reached a low of seven degrees that a year on December twenty third\nDowntown Houston even colder than that back in Nineteen thirty reached a low of five degrees\nSo if we ever saw anything that low in this modern day beyond pipes freezing people would be experiencing some serious problems in their homes or discomfort the least of those problems just for reference last year if you remember those tropical gardens experience so much damage from the cold snaps we did see\nWe only experienced freezing conditions five times this past winter twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen\nWhich doesn't seem like much five times but one of those times we got down to Nineteen degrees\nAnd it wasn't just a calm Nineteen degrees it was a window driven Nineteen degrees so even if you covered up those tropical plants the hope fill in danger of for instance or the bottle brushes\nThey still got Bert sometimes killed I can I tell you how many Sago palm trees and my little area of ... for instance elope here let's got ... got birds and they're still recovering today\nSo that was a low temperature of Nineteen degrees\nIf in this El Nino patterns the jet stream that's a little bit farther south who's to say we don't see even colder weather\nYou mentioned pipes and they can burst and uh the the lack of insulation and this is something that is different from other parts of the country so if you're a new huge stone in a and haven't been in this climate before when the temperature dips down\nAt or below freezing one of the things that people ask you to do around here is open up all those cabinet doors are\nGoing to do you want the heat it led to the pikes because we don't typically have any insulation on any of our pipes and not just in that spot underneath the sink but all the way through the the whole piping system\nVery true and especially in the homes built before the Nineteen nineties where the codes are a little bit different and you're absolutely right and and we we can laugh about it now because we're well above freezing but when it does get down into the the teens and twenties especially for more than several hours\nThe piper ... are are very real problem and they can cost a lot of money a couple of thousand dollars not to mention the water damage if you're not home when it happens to run up to the street and shut the water down\nI mentioned the ice storm from last winter or earlier and there's a great example of something that if you are coming from northern climes you may have been\nReally puzzled by how that shut down the city but we actually had public officials saying please stay home and the whole point is we don't really have a way to deal with ice on a roadway on a bridge other than to just close the ... of the road or the bridge until it melts\nIt's absolutely right we don't have the same snow mitigation infrastructure we don't have the snowplows we don't have the fleet of sanding trucks\nTurn more of those turn does know Britain but\nWe don't worry about we don't worry about it what we do as um\nWe generate a lot of interest in the ... says fifty percent of our scientists have never consigned before sixty billion dollars fell into the U.S every year in ...\nSo we consume a lot and then you start aggregating what happens to those that mostly there and people's closets\nThere are some questions to be asked about uh\nYou literally you in this business and\nBeing a not young\nNot male founder\nRight whoa we'll know look look what's billed as soon\nAs you get different right you get a front for you going out to try to get the money right to try to make the pitch right and and I I'm sure if I said and I know I don't know to do\nThis you know as a bit of different experience for you as well out\nOf wedlock any woman going out raising capital as hard and um there's multiple stages and I would say at the beginning it's always hard for everyone\nI then you compound the fact that I was an older female so most of the people I mean with I can be their mother\nYou know which is a little awkward but um I'll tell you what made the difference for me when I got in front of a female venture capitalists an early stage female venture capital which was supposed to do 'cause there aren't many early stage like maybe I don't know how many maybe ten and the and the U.S\nAnd once I explain what I was doing they got it immediately and the members sit there and they don't really uh really impact I had a guy said really women by a lot of issues and I even had ... I mean I have all this data there's so much data\nAnd they go I don't believe that data Mike how can you not believe that that\n... and here you are with what I understand is close to a billion dollars a year and so we shouldn't\nBe over a billion next year if we do our job right\nOkay so what are the headwinds that road right because nobody needs nobody needs the stuff you're so right it's it's a luxury items disposable income so what are you worried about it\nSo that this is a business born out of the recession the truth as during the recession my bet is we'll get more goods because people lot liquidity yet more goods and you have a big market and people are people aren't going to stop buying duty they're just not\nThey may want to they may switch they're buying from primary to secondary but they're not going to stop buying it and this is something that when we first walk into a consignment who's never consigned fifty percent of the people as I said before I never can remind and they get their first check their blown away they had no idea that that money was trapped we\nGot another chunk of my interview with Julie Wainwright including me do looking for where those new musical glasses from receiving wound up its appeal to be Joel then it's on our corner office parks [noise]\nWith all the way up through a joy I'm going to give us a lot of you can relate to a survey out from the staffing company accountant says tiger workers cost American companies four hundred and eleven billion dollars a year\nIt seems hard but they do get some specifics workers who were under arrested accidentally paying the whole company twice or deleting a project it took a thousand hours to put together top five cities by the way where people were poor don't work tired Nashville Austin Denver Indianapolis in the morning also wherever I happened to be on any given day\n", "show_name": "Houston Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
