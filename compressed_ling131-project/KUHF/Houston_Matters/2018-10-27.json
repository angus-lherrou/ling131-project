actress and owner of Mockingbird network dot com brand developed easier Mary Charles Brenda welcome\nTo use the matters thanks\nPanel area researchers say a government program to purchase storm damaged and flood prone homes in greater Houston could be accelerating historic trends of white flight from the city's core to the suburbs there's new city sevens Travis ... reported Tuesday\nA new study of more than three thousand home buyouts in Harris County before Hurricane Harvey finds most of the place in neighborhoods where the history of white flight white homeowners leaving for suburban areas\nThe study from Rice University's Baker Institute for urban research finds the biggest predictor of buyouts isn't neighborhoods history of changing from mostly white mostly Hispanic between Nineteen Seventy in the year two thousand\nWhile the study did not consider the thousand or so home buyouts added to Harris counties program since Harvey\nResearcher Kevin ... says it definitely suggest to us that the practice of using buyouts in Harris County over the last Twenty years has helped facilitate the sort of out migration from areas that have already seen substantial white flight in prior decades buyouts accelerate historic trends of white flight from the city to the verbs\nIs this good bad or ugly Mary started off\nIt's bad and and this study is really suspicious I looked it up and rises website where there was more information and they're really asking a question more than making a conclusion they're saying they suggest this and\nThey also say there ought to be a study and they also admit this is my favorite we do not know the racial identity of the people who have accepted buyouts so they're making these jumps and then the same Thirty years from Nineteen Seventy two thousand here in Houston according to the census our population changed\nFrom like maybe fifty five sixty percent\nAnglo non Hispanic White to a much lower percentage of those are much higher percentage of Hispanic so the fact that these buyout areas have fewer Anglos and more Hispanics we're sort of\nTells you that it's in Houston you know I'm concerned about the term white flight and I saw there was an Indiana University professor who did a study that seemed a lot more solid saying that white flight is more\nRacial than economic that people are leaving or because they don't want to live next to people who aren't like them but in this case in this study you know I Love the city and I love it's diversity of their other\nNon Hispanic whites who want to leave Houston\nFine go [laughter] and I'm happy to see them go maybe they can go to our suburbs in Fort Wayne county which has been called the most ethnically diverse county in America you know I think these buyouts might have been because of flooding and rather than white flight might have been mold flight or water flight or I don't like fish swimming in my living room for\nCharles I mean I basically agree with Mary and I guess it seems to me that the\nOverall effect on a macro scale is probably pretty small I mean marriage right if you look at just the census\nPatterns and data over the last thirty or so years I mean three thousand people here and there is kind of a blip that said they'd raised an interesting question and it's something that I agree you know we probably should give more thought too and I mean\nI'm assuming having not read this myself that the way that this can come about is if the buyouts are voluntary as in you know this is available you come tell us if you want it\nYou know maybe you could rethink that maybe you could change the criteria for allowing it or maybe you can say okay this part of town it's flooded enough times in a short period there were just buying everybody out and you can take it or leave it\nI don't know I on the one hand there's nothing about that sounds good it's still probably a relatively small effect overall and it's not like it would change the nature of Houston if none of this existed but we could still gives them\nIt and maybe consider if there are things we might do differently to mitigate this relatively small effect which is still in effect\nAlright ... I don't know how this keeps happening and I mean but every time you bring me on I've been personally affected by some beef from before because I have seen white flight happen\nIt's bad I went to high school that was mostly white and I believe it was like fifty five percent white forty percent Hispanic the rest were black and other other communities living there\nAnd then another high school brand new high schools opened and the population flipped\nFrom fifty five percent white to twelve percent white in one ear\nAnd the ramifications of that in the school itself were completely noticeable arts programs died out after school programs completely died out funding or even like most basic equipment died out when people talk about why flight it isn't so much the like on coming\nOr leaving of a particular race or culture we're talking about money we're talking about people who are impacted by that neighborhood losing out on\nLet's face it what kind of Asian people take for granted which is the arts and culture and sports arenas and vital services like police officers things that because of the way the system has been set up\nCaucasian people have access to and people of color don't know how to access without sounding demanding without sounding put down like ... why can't you take care of yourself and it's a very\nIt puts us in a very strange position because we're either a gonna lose out on low income housing or affordable housing because of incoming white flight or the opposite we're going to lose out on stability in our neighborhood because all the funding that was there\nIs no longer there to keep in mind that the majority of people of color were living in these neighborhoods have only been able to own homes and have a tradition of\nPassing their homes and properties down from one generation to the other for maybe one two generations at most\nMeanwhile Caucasian families have been here since the since Houston was settled\nSo for us it isn't just the loss of a neighborhood or a house\nIt's the potential loss of whatever savings\nAnd whatever legacy we can leads to our children\nSo I I think they're said big fear going on because it it creeps is very unstable environment and even though it's a microcosm to a neighborhood those ramifications are long lasting in education in taxes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Houston Matters", "city": "Houston", "day": "27"}
