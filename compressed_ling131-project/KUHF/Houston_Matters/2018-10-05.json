can provide some additional obstacles\nFor the last Nineteen years Baylor College of medicine in Texas children's hospital of disgusted this transition at a chronic illness and disability conference in here to tell us more about it is the conference organizers he's Dr Albert hurting wrote er he's professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of medicine and chief of adolescent medicine at Texas children's hospital\nAlso with us as a patient who navigated that transition to a few years back Jacqueline benefit is\nDr hurting rotor jak he wasn't a Houston matters thank Ukraine as we chat we welcome your questions and comments about transitioning into adulthood with a chronic illness or disability you can call us at seven one two three four four zero eighty eight Seventy reach out on Twitter at Houston matters you can email us\nAt talk in Houston matters dot org\nThat are hurting wrote her let's start here what why is this an important subject to consider for young patients with chronic illnesses or disability [noise] there's several\nReasons Greg one is from a safety point of view and the quality of care uh children are news who are cared for by pediatric specialists have\nMaintained a level of health but at some point they need to transition to an adult based care of this is a success story in medicine and many of these conditions simply never survived into adulthood Thirty years ago\nBut now the expectation is Ninety percent of them will live well into their fourth fifth sixth decades so there needs to be a capacity on the adult side to take these pediatric onset conditions and take care of them in adulthood\nIf that capacity isn't built their health can deteriorate and they can for go care for one reason or another they can't find a specialist or they don't have access to a kind of special pediatric care on the adult type so they can deteriorate in any chronic illness it's been demonstrated in the peer reviewed researcher that their health can deteriorate\nIt's also important because their parents their caregivers who take care of them as a child or aging as well\nAnd as they age on and they have their conditions\nThe young emerging adult needs to be able to take care of themselves to the extent that they can and that doesn't happen overnight just like many other uh capabilities in adulthood it's acquired over time\nAnd I imagine some of them face the same challenges anybody else does with uh parents that are aging in some cases they may find themselves as the caregivers themselves to those aging parents\nExactly and if their health isn't maintain then they can't certainly can't deliver care for others\nAnd plus developmentally it's important that we all want the same things we want to be independent and we want to drive a car and known a house and start a family et cetera\nAnd if your health is not adequate and it's lost in that transition you can achieve the quality of life that you want so that those are the reasons from the patient's family point of view that it's so important\nWhat are some examples of some of the the health challenges that ah somebody who's been dealing with some sort of chronic illness through their childhood they make this transition into adulthood like everybody does a and over time what what what might be a potential challenger threat that they might face\nThey could have a specialist at Texas children's hospital in their condition and then they transitioned into adulthood and they may be covered by different insurance product for example\nThey may not be able to find that specialist on the adult side so especially in Texas with many rural counties you can go into some counties where you have to travel hundreds of miles so access to that specialized care is an issue\nUm access to equipment so people who need specialized equipment wheelchairs and things like that they might be covered under Medicaid\nAnd then they age out of Medicaid and they find that they can't get Medicaid or SSI or they can't find any insurance\nSo it's not necessarily a question of as they become adults that they're doing anything differently about their health themselves but just a lack maybe of access to the the sort of specialized care that they had up until they were Eighteen\nRight and so the environment changes around him from an insurance point of view from a logistics point of view from an access to adult care point of view they've been used do these wraparound services and the pediatric world\nAnd it's different than the adult world do you think patients and their families are typically prepared for that my experiences there and not prepared in some of the responsibility falls on the pediatric community and that's what we're trying to do with this conference and what we do with Texas children's in around the country\nIs try to start earlier start to get parents\nAnd youth themselves prepared for we will help you get there you have to do some of it yourself but it is unfair for them to say for us to say suddenly you're Eighteen and you're going to go into to an adult provider at your next visit there simply unprepared so most families\nAnd you think are not prepared enough for this transition\nLet's turn now to a Jacqueline better view these Jackie uh uh you have been through that transition just what a what the doctor was talking about\nYou have what's called and told me if I get this right focal said mental glum or you look ... sclerosis although I Do yeah okay well why don't you do write focus like mental ugly routes less as a boy All right so what is that\nIt's an idiosyncratic chronic kidney disease I'm\nSo that that means it's just something that popped up out of the blue and there's not a particular explanation for why it happened pretty much okay and when did this manifest itself\nOr I notice on my sixteenth birthday that had fallen ankles and from there it was your analysis blood test and then so I think in the way by can I had a diagnosis\nAnd this is this is a a disease that affects your kidneys right so you went on to dialysis yet for how long were you on that\nI was on dialysis for three days soy uh two years and it lasts ten and a half hours every single night\nOh my goodness so so overnight I assume yes okay that that still regardless of what it is that's a lot it was horrible Loma I'm like as a so that you did that for two years and then ultimately your brother a donated a kidney yet right\nBy there with a perfect match and he didn't even hesitate and he donated\nHis grade and this was when twenty twelve yeah OK so six years since all is well south I found a far so good through all of that I imagine you had a lot of interactions with the pediatric healthcare system when did you start to make that shift to adult care\nA little by little my doctor my ... especially wouldn't\nLet me can is eight by she wouldn't let my mom and send me an answer the question for me she's making me more than whatever Alice feelings and asked me what my prescriptions wearing what where my dad would save\nIt I was doing anything and I fell fell little by little they're kind of preparing me kind of thing like you know if anything bad by kicking out\nLike she handled it in a way that made it where it was like OK at the end of the day I Know and leaving rather than one of those things where it was like well you're the age level you need to move on thin\nSo for me it was one of those things that it was just inevitable but I guess for some people it seems like\nIt's not something they didn't think about or prepare for and I think that's like the biggest\nThis programming is Bronx you by the Texas secretary of state providing voters details and what approved forms that photo ID they can bring to the polls more apt to vote Texas ... guys or eight hundred to five to vote\n... and it's interesting I think about the timing of all this not that there is a good time for anything like that now in any instance but in your case to have a diagnosis at age sixteen be on dialysis for two years to age Eighteen that means you were closing in on that date in on that moment when you would no longer\nHave that pediatric care available to you without maybe knowing exactly how things were going to play out\nYeah and even then like I knew the main thing my doctor focused on with me now in my own body annoying health but I didn't know anything about insurance I didn't know anything about like how do you make a doctor's appointment or anything like that at that point I was recently my protection you know I was handling\nMostly the things that I could with my own body and with my own perception and all that but everything outside of that like anybody else that\nAt the end ... making appointments thing new doctors and all this stuff like I didn't know anything going into that\nAnd how long did it take to get to a point where you felt somewhat comfortable with the system and ...\nAre you all are [laughter] do you think young adults like yourself when their kids when they're dealing with chronic health issues are ready for that change in care when it occurs no\nDefinitely not it's like everything else is already spiraling like that's the last thing you want to think about\nThat said do do you think today you are to some degree on top of your health care needs in a way at least that that you probably wouldn't have been had this never happened to you\nFisher yeah fishing\nDuck to her going to order some sort of this transition that we are talking about is of course financial what are some of the obstacles today for patients with chronic illnesses to get their own insurance after the age out of being able to stay on their parents' plan\nSo if they're covered under their parents' commercial plan under the ace EA they can be covered up they ... twenty six or probably the single biggest\nAnother one is developmental delay on the part of the patient so think of the highest risk patients one who is a developmental disability maybe has some occupational therapists mentioned maybe have some ... issues neurological issues his specificity and can't do a lot of things from so simple activities of daily living\nIt doesn't take long to go with that you're oh teen your P. T. before your functions starts to deteriorate\nSo those conditions coupled with the lowest socioeconomic status or to massive risk factors for deterioration so this divide is striking when it comes to transition Ramon is on the line from ... what's your question or comment\nWell like\nI think oh\nDon't know I don't know\n[noise] what not to bring out [noise] [noise] and\nWe're not there [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise]\nOkay thanks very much for the call and for the comment I guess ... in answering that question I'm curious if that's part of the purpose of the conference that you hold each year to try and close that gap in it and make sure that and it's not necessarily dedicating a particular wing and specialized care but that every doctor every nurse is educated properly\nExactly Greg it's not just one hospital it's going to do this every adult hospital has prepared let's just take for example and I don't know the specifics of of the case of course a that was a just mentioned but [noise]\nWe recognize that the autism has been an increasingly prevalent problem and as those children in adolescence age into adulthood\nAnd if they come in with abdominal pain into an emergency room they need to be prepared for interpreting the cues from a sub group of patients who don't like to be touched for example who have a hard time communicating with their symptoms are so\nI Would anticipate in the next you know immediate future but the culture of medicine will be transferred so that people can communicate who otherwise might have communication difficulties\nAnesthesia pain control is a big problem for people can't communicate\nIt it is a problem on the pediatric side is not as if we have that handled but I think we understand the developmental trajectory patients who probably are a bit better prepared for somebody to just show up an adult hospital nobody knows them and their post often they have pain and they can't communicate so that and that's a dangerous situation\nIt's Dr Albert hurricane wrote er he's a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of medicine and chief of adolescent medicine at Texas children's hospital is also the organizer of the nineteenth annual chronic illness and disability conference on the transition from pediatric to adult based care\nIt takes place October twenty fifth I'm twenty six there's a link to more information at Houston matters dot org Jacqueline better view this is a patient who made the transition from pediatric to adult based care\nAs she contented with a disease affecting your kidneys Dr hurting wrote er Jackie thanks very much and I very appreciate [noise]\nJust ahead why a doctor visiting Houston is calling for stricter guidelines to screen and diagnosed high blood sugar during pregnancy stay with us and she used to ...

chat we welcome your questions and comments at seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy or email us at talk at Houston matters dot org [noise]\nSo I just offered the short short version of what exactly though is gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes is weird sugar is not\nA process the usual way uh we usually get sugar by three ways we we eat it we\nMake it from our break down of a like a gym which is a complex sugar in the liver or we do a thing called glucose in the genesis which is all liver function taking amino acids and all that\nAnd is there anything about pregnancy that can cause disruption of any of those three processes\nYes very definitely got slows down that's why some people can eat as much\nUm but the hormones of pregnancy the Korean and cannot a trope and which is the\nPositive rabbit test or the pregnancy test that's what you get 'em also estrogen a itself and higher doses a protest around which helps keep the uterus quiet cortisol goes up up and ask me goes up a lot of\nThings all sorts of things are going on do you know for sure that a mother to be wasn't already diabetic and just undiagnosed\nWe do not know I'm probably about maybe half to one percent people have pre existing diabetes\nType two diabetes is what I'm Talking about not talking about somebody who goes into a coma because he ate too much sugar I'm usually a type two diabetic it's somebody who is obese to begin with who does not exercise um and\nPregnancy makes that all worse because if he were kind of borderline you'll be tipped over by all the metabolic changes then in third trimester you had another hormone called insulin ace I use it I tell people it's like a little pac man it's going around in\nYou know ... so it can't work [noise]\nIt's always important to keep blood sugar under control of course for anyone but but is it especially important for moms to be\nA very much so because we know a in one study in the American Journal of the steps of the county college he there was double the antithesis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy\nUm we also know that babies get too big a if mom sugars are very high and she doesn't have basket Hershey's I'm we know that um that is injury to mom\nAt birth a there's a higher incidence of Syrian sections there is more pre maturity if your mom is diabetic so that we induced because a baby is not doing well inside\nHow much of a challenge is to keep diet under control during pregnancy\nIt's like telling anybody that you need to lose weight and go on a diet right it it's very difficult to uh we just have a little better um incentive to be good about our diet in pregnancy because we know it's affecting our child\nThere are medications that people were of type ... diabetes can use to help keep their blood sugar under control ideally along with diet and exercise but I suspect and you can tell me that they're maybe there's some limitations on what kinds of medications are appropriate for someone who's pregnant\nWell both are college still feels that it should be insulin um the insulin will give you control there's more blood sugar variant variation with the uh\nToo much insulin you're late eating you don't eat a on time um [noise] the oral agents um the ... does not yet a cross the placenta a\nMets form in which is one that we usually use for poly cystic ovarian syndrome which in turn leads to diabetes\nHas um does get across and we worry about that\nThis is used in matters I'm Craig Cohen we're discussing gestational diabetes with Dr Virginia hauling OBGYN recently retired from

empathy um we have so much voter apathy that people don't cast the ballot and they don't seem to care and when you add onto that the districts are drawn specifically to elect one party or the

bothered by the way Dr Ford has been treated\nLet's go next to Joe and Katie Joe what's your question or comment\nWhile my comment is that uh we have become you know and just fighting now is a ticket
