U. H. F. Houston and K. U. H. T. T. V. eight point six used in the service of the University of Houston\nBy from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere President Trump acknowledged today there is no proof that middle Easterners have infiltrated a caravan of Central Americans now making their way to the U.S border\nNPR's Scott Horsley reports Trump has been issuing dire warnings about the caravan for several days now as he stumps for votes ahead of the midterm elections\nReporters traveling with the Central American caravan and the migrants themselves say they've seen no middle Easterners in their group despite the president's claims Trump conceded his ominous warnings might be unfounded buddy continues to insist the caravan and illegal immigration more generally pose a grave threat to the United states certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country fad bomb not letting them in\nWell it's not unheard of for people from the middle east tried across the Mexican border it's very rare out of more than three hundred thousand border crossers apprehended last year fewer than a hundred were from the middle east Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nAnd the strongest responds to the death of Washington Post columnist your milk showbiz either Trump Administration says is revoking the visas some Saudi individuals suspected of being involved in his death secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking at the state department today or did the horrific nature of what appears to have gone on inside the Saudi consulate in this stumble\nWe want to make sure that everyone understands that the United states doesn't believe is that the killing of democracy like it was a was anything other than a horrific act and we hope that we can work together both with Congress and our allies to hold those responsible accountable\nSaudis have claimed to show ... inside the consulate after a fight broke out whoever Turkish authorities say he was murdered by Saudi operatives President Trump for his part now says he's been told by Saudi Arabia's crown prince lower level operatives are strictly to blame for the killing\nA liberal watchdog group is suing the Trump Administration for documents on the future of the FBI Headquarters in Washington emails made public last week indicate President Trump was involved in the decision which is NPR's Peter Overby reports seems to affect the value of his Washington DC hotel near the FBI building\nTheir group American oversight is suing under the freedom of Information Act a couple of years ago the FBI was planning to move its headquarters to the suburbs the old site would be re developed perhaps with a new hotel just across the street from the Trump International hotel\nA better off we'll get elected as a result of that here in Harris County yes here in Harris County statewide on not as I I don't think so I think that the Cruze will hold on [noise] but I think what you're seeing is that what was a otherwise moribund Republican base has now been energized and that's contributing to what I think is a higher turnout\nYou won't get high turnouts in midterms without both parties and particularly um the Republicans turning out cause air base is beginning to shrink\nThey're getting fewer and fewer voters and that's called death when you start looking at the electorate just look at the registered voters\nWhat you see is that more people who are leaving the elected are Anglo than are entering the electorate if people coming into frequent voting\nTend to be non white the people who are leaving who were frequent voters they tend to be white and so what you're seeing is just a natural aging and exiting of the electorate what you've not seen as this kind of turnout this this disparity between democratic and Republican turnout\nHas actually widened over the years\nThis election mostly due to very strong senatorial candidate probably the strongest senatorial candidate that Democrats have seen in twenty five years and I've never seen so many competitive house races not just the two between Fletcher and I'm ... percent enlightened and Crenshaw but even ... Carney I'm the titles in basis competitive race\nSpeaking of how competitive these races are does President Trump or deciding to host his rally here in Houston signal to you that maybe Harris County is a battleground county\nSo it's not about about it's been lost two thousand and eight President Obama won the catty by half a point in two thousand twelve he wanted to buy a point and a half in two thousand twelve\nHillary Clinton won the county by twelve points in each of those free elections down ballot Democrats were first taking forty fifty percent than sixty Seventy percent and in two thousand sixteen\nI wouldn't be real clear about this not a single Republican candidate one county was not a single judge not a single county elected official\nEvery county wide Democrat in two thousand sixteen beat every county like candidate\nOn the Republican ticket now that was the presidential\nThe question of always has been that in those interim twelve and fourteen\nEven going back to ten Democrats could not hold that advantage and barely were able to held even you know half of a half the races something now to sixteen is a test will democratic turnout fall off such that\nJudges and and the candidates that are running countywide for let's say clerk I'm like trout and again centered will they not get enough votes and the the big concern among Democrats as that turn out the evidence would seem to suggest at this point on one day and you know what I call ten thousand feet high is that the Democrats seem to be holding\nTheir own with Republican turnout but still traveling but I don't think this is a battleground President Trump didn't come to used in because it's a battleground President Trump came to Texas and he knows in Harris County can be twenty eight to thirty three percent of the total vote cast\nHe needed to widen that\nEven if that gap favors Democrats now he needs so wide that and I think it's hard to tell what the what the Trump effect was but um we'll see it in two weeks but I think the big concern here is not that the Democrats are going to women Texas state wide but rather that the key to winning elections is getting candidates\nEr well because I Do like a detective through ... through ...\nThrough the environment through the ... um through her secrets I've completely please piece together well made huh that person what may react like that to me at that time it makes perfect sense it doesn't mean it hasn't had its effect but\nThat's certainly no on glass tools my mother my father and my sister you know any more because of writing the book\n[noise] the bookends of you deciding that you're going to burn your mother's diaries that were in that bag that was mark to throw in an open because he didn't want to leave your daughter with him did you actually follow through on that and burn them\nNo can't do it it's terrible and on top of that the two books I've written it's me in a way leaving to ... some idol to\nSend that to show how read the book\nShe finds until I'm ... upsetting she's tried a couple of paragraphs ... ended up in ... so you know me thinking I'll be the big a person I'm going to throw away my mothers and fathers diaries festival I haven't done that in second left to move so yeah no good\nSince your music and the splits was impart a way\nOf expressing your anger and your new memoir is in part about trying to understand the source of your anger how it's affected your life has dealt with it over the years how you deal with it now what did you try to teach your daughter about how to deal with anger\n[noise] well the interesting thing is my daughter doesn't have the anger um she has a different personality to me much more grounded but also different times the fights are different um she she doesn't have to literally kicked down tools which I had done it in the past and I don't I'm often boost 'em to get HUD\nUm they're all other\nParts of society and the ... and the world who do still have to do that women and men um but for a young white woman in London it isn't so how does it well for me so I don't think she has the same level of anger\nUm she she may say on behalf of other people and I think a lot of young people do feel anger on behalf of other people in the world and I hope that generation in a way and I think I Will that they actually help people less\nAdvantaged um

in less than two weeks\nIt's Well Linda staple so let's discuss it and will then give to other significant developments in government and politics in today's political round up joining us today or Houston Chronicle columnist Eric the greeter at University of St Thomas political science professor John Taylor welcome both of you\nAs we chat we welcome your questions and comments about anything going on in government and politics at talk of Houston matters dot org or seven one three four four zero eighty eight Seventy\nAlright so first of all I'm not going to ask you to speculate on any particular thing added\nTo this it's an active investigation we know these are suspicious packages there's not much more that we can be certain of and you know how this works and breaking new social relation some I'm sure we will learn more in the hours and days had but I Am curious about your thoughts as to\nHow increasingly aggressive and at times violent political rhetoric affects us and affects people in the\nPolitical world\nAnd I just went silent all of a sudden because that's how it affected me um it does bother me I mean it is a concern a real concern about the rhetoric and how it actually is not only impacting but but\nWas going to use the word you know make it make political dialogue just completely caustic anymore course and people will say you know historians will tell me yeah Eighteen fifty called they want they want their a political rhetoric back\nThat said it is a real concern about where we are we're we're rationing into violence ratcheting into into violent rhetoric what does it say about the country and where we are that I that that to me is a real concern for not only now but for the future\nYeah I Would say the same thing I think we ... mine that although most of us are capable of differentiating between inflammatory rhetoric and actual cost incitement\nI it doesn't require everyone being called you cited for incitement to have occurred um creating this sort of situation\nYou know you know just last week a at a rally in Montana\nPresident Trump praised a congressman therefore body slamming a reporter last year if you don't have to look far on social media to find folks connecting those dots ... an hour and laying blame for violent acts or attempted acts on rhetoric like that ... up already in some cases on who's to people is that\nA fair connection of dots\nI'm again we are two weeks out from election among other things it's a case of ratcheting ratcheting up support 'em ... it it it it to me it makes no sense to do this politically let alone legally to do this because it's going to set up its first of all it's going to set up a situation of lawsuits out the wants to do it just is\nAdditionally you're talking about a ... a U.S as a segment of American citizens who deserve the same equal treatment anybody else deserves and certainly don't deserve to be treated and ... and ...\nThe president also announced an intention to withdraw from the longstanding ins has the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia or he argues Russia's already written egging a but this is actually what Russia wants right oh no question\nThat the Russians would love to see us basically abrogate or or remove ourselves from the IMF treaty nine of treaty briefly was basically something to that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev together thirty one years ago the idea was to to base to produce if not eliminate intermediate range missiles which are roughly five hundred kilometers fifty five hundred kilometers\nFrom basically especially making Europe an armed camp [noise]\nUm no I Will know the Obama administration was the first to actually talk about about the Russians running on the treaty the Trump administration's actually following through on this is the thing\nThe real fear is an arms race developing as a result of us\nWithdrawing from the treaty and it's not just us and the Russians it's also the Chinese they may not be signatories to the ins but it may encourage the Chinese and bankers the Indians and the Pakistanis the Israelis the Iranian other nuclear power ... basically to develop intermediate range missiles and made it rains missile just to give people an idea of range if we're talking about the United states\nOf launching a missile from Houston and hitting Chicago or a more long range intermediate missile launching from Houston hitting Anchorage\nAh not not that we have anything against Chicago right nonetheless myself [laughter] ah Jerry's on the line from Katie jury what's your question or comment\nYes I was listening to the cabinet hearings on NPR court even after reports that the money and before that they love it I Would think that the Democrats were on the way they were very very ugly or to a cabin up\nAnd not that I thought that he that early should or shouldn't be confirmed it worked out but I Wonder if that really did a uptick the Republican afterwards I ...\nI Would agree that I think the Democrats and many were in regretted their aggressive on a number of friends and they were sort of aggressive in an focused away some sort of defense and I think that this kind of came back to\nTo their advantage and also came back to Dr forest particular disadvantage that by the time she came forward and gay protests around which was very sincere and wrenching there's this perception that Democrats have been just out to get Kavanaugh for any reason and they were looking for a thing to to get them on\nNow and preventing Eric has come I think it it it it helped to develop Trump's argument is that there is a mob mentality and plays for the Democrats\nFrank uh we have a question from reaching in sugar land what do you think about cook political changing the Texas congressional district twenty to race to lean Republican does it look like there's enough momentum to make Tom delays old seat flipped\nAbsolutely and that raises one of the most interesting to watch because you have in not only just sort of talking about Senate races putting a lot of enthusiasm into the electorate you have a very strong congressional candidate a Democrat trickle Carney running against the dolphin income in there and a lot of down ballot reasons you've got a bank Brian metals in running for Ben county district attorney\nYou Jennifer county running protects house in overlapping district ... feet are running for state Senate I think there's a lot of energy in that district we've seen in ... in early voting this farm massive turnout and and you know huge crowds at rallies\nIt goes back to the idea is all about demographics of demographics missed like CD seven to change the CD Tony Tony too as well here's a legitimate shot there's no questions you raise a lot of money to which already told him yeah it it seems like no matter what we do we come back to election [laughter] that was right [laughter] that's what everybody's fixated
