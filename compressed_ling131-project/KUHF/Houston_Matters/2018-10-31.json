the than it is restored worried on I ... through November second Houston grand opera dad or gay\nActivists I'm a journalist and I want to I Want people to understand what the ... the story is in a comprehensive way\nWhat kinds of things are you looking for what what's the stuff that catches your eye and tells you this is something worth taking a photograph of\nWell as a still photographer I'm really looking for moments I'm looking for that fraction of a second that tells something um something different\nThat reveals what's going on with video of course it's very different you're looking at a series in sequences of images but with the still photo really comes down to those moments and the pictures that stand the test of time are the ones that make us feel and so\nIf I can tell a story and I can make the viewer feel like they were there feel the emotion of that moment and touch them um maybe it may change their opinion a bit maybe it'll change their minds\nAnd sometimes now and again uh my pictures or will change a government policy and the and we want to increase understanding and the and that's why I Do this what\nDid you learn was there anything new that you didn't know before about the whole of immigration that you that you uncovered\nBut I've seen over the years\nSince I started this project about ten years ago that the uh the breakdown of people who come in as much different when I first started this project it was mostly men into a few women coming over 'em to seek employment in the U.S and now you have so many families are coming from Central America\nAnd that has a lot to do with the with the rise in violence or in places\nIn northern Central America like Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador are so many families are coming across an unaccompanied minors as well and often times they are actually seeking out to border patrol agents once they come across the Rio Grande\nBecause they want to turn themselves in for asylum so it's very a very different kind of story were there any\nOther um disease states might be a little bit more concrete there may be a very obvious thing that has happened that has changed someone's physical or mental health I think with dementia it's hard to say where that tipping point and I would almost argue that at the time that that diagnosis is being made\nIs a point when patients can very actively engaging future planning and really think about [noise]\nRegardless of whether they think they reached the tipping point they probably want to start making these kinds of plans because other people around them may think that they're already passed that tipping point\nThat's also a conversation a you'd be hard pressed to find somebody that\nTo have that checked absolutely I think that a lot of patience are hesitant to have that conversation because they feel a it might not never happened to me or be a it's very morbid to discuss this er and\nAfraid of what that will stand for because once you're making those decisions you're realizing\nI'm going to lose a lot I'm going into my independence I'm\nGoing to lose the ability to take care of myself my ability to drive myself and even participate in the things I Love so you're becoming you're coming face to face with the with the realization that I'm making decisions about not doing the things I Love to do anymore and having to relinquish to control that I have to\nSomebody else to my caregivers and many in many cases in the office Dr home seeds is probably more than I Do it's their adult children who have to make those\nDecisions for them at that point and how\nImportant is to have this conversation early quickly after the diagnosis\nYeah I Can't I Can't stress enough how important it is because\nUm the the longer people wait to have these conversations they then have them under duress when these decisions become urgent\nWhen it becomes um almost an emergency to try to figure out what the future plan is going to be\nIt's so important to try to set had one's future plans very early on in the course of an illness like dementia or Alzheimer's that is going to impact the ability to make those decisions later and to express those things to your family and your caregivers\nUs so that they know what the ideal scenario would look like if you pointed out today\nIsrael ... if you wait too long and the dementia or Alzheimer's shuts and you can reach a point where you may not even realize that you have this disease\nAbsolutely and at that point it might be too late for you to make a decision that would be found for your medical care so again it's the risk of having this conversation a little too early perhaps maybe but it is one of the situation we were about to be over prepared and set yourself up for it just imagine worst case scenario I hate to say\nIt that way um but ... that your family members will appreciate that conversation because they are concerned later on as something that as a patient you might not realize that you're putting them at the dress\n[noise] this is using matters on credit Cohen we're talking with Isabel does from Baylor College of medicine and Dr highly homes from governor medical school at UT health about how to know when you should step back from work or social events to\nCare for your health for particularly a mid life altering diagnoses from dementia captured the stroke of a particular type of dementia and Alzheimer's we welcome your thoughts at seven ones for four zero eighty eight Seventy you can reach out to us on Twitter at Houston matters you can email us\nAt talk it's used in matters dot org is does come up in other instances cancer stroke other diagnoses\nHow was the Congress are different than those voters\nIn that situation when I'm In the office with a room with the patient um\nThere is more of a finite start to okay effective immediately you can no longer drive for instance because you had the stroke\nLast week you just got to start from the hospital and you still don't have\nYou have not gained your motor skills so there's a a clear beginning to when you are no longer going to be able to care for yourself for instance and you're gonna have to relinquish that independence to somebody else or act and dementia our doctor homes can speak more to it it's more of a ... a slow transition but\nFor definitely and stroke victims chemo patients seizure patient\nSo that they are more aware of their their participating in their everyday activities except that now there's a finite point where you might not be able to Dr ...\n[noise] I agree I mean as Isabel thing that with other disease conditions are there is sometimes more finite point at which these decisions happen or their necessitate in\nI think also the stakes are a little different\nIn that judgment and inside are uniquely affected in dementia and Alzheimer's and it makes it extremely challenging to have\nA caring and thoughtful conversation about removing someone's independence particularly if they find that they don't feel impaired and um it can be very difficult to tell when someone is impaired and family members and caregivers\nAre desperately trying to work with health care professionals to to convince their family members to do what they think is right for them and there can be a very difficult point at which determining that you're at that tipping point or that you're really at that point where you would step back and change the things that you do and again and other conditions it might be a little bit more straightforward\nAnd there's not as much of the issue of judgment and insight and\nWe have a question from hell he asks is there are ways someone could self assess a potential future dementia and maybe by setting themselves a questionnaire to be reminded of in the future\nWell there are several questionnaires a dementia questionnaires out there I Know that at a clinic about once a year we offer a a very brief at many cognitive assessment test assessment and uh your provider your your health care provider probably has access to this I\nDon't know what tests that are used Dr homes we use the ... but that's one of the ones that are several out there\nThere are several screening tests I think the challenge would be that any screening test that we do have\nIs designed to at least to to detect mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and a lot of um researchers would suggest that we probably need to be intervening in preventing illness well before those symptoms have become a parent because the disease is already well on its way\nSo I don't have a great answer that unfortunately we don't have a great earlier screening test um I liked the idea of sending herself for future questionnaire that's really intriguing to me I think in the future will probably be using different questionnaires as well\nI think the more important factors right now would be family history any suggestion of family genetic history of early onset dementia\nAnd I think even more important than any of that is healthy lifestyle in midlife that's probably the better way to plan and prevent that we have currently\nHave YouTube personally are gone through this with family or quote close friends\nI'm indirectly going through if my mother and my aunt and my grandmother my grandmother being shown some signs of dementia\nBut also I'm having the resistance of of just making a plan for herself not realizing that she's not in a position to take care of herself and also her ... she's ... no longer able to drive because her diabetes affect her eyesight so seeing my my mother and my aunt\nMake this decision says grilling decisions about who's going to take mom to air it to the hospital and she had a fat and she was she was a process with the caregiver the other day seeing that and hearing it from them I think I think I'm Talking to on a patient and never Dr hopes\nVery similarly ... I'm really addressing my grandmothers and the lady to be safe independently\nAnd there were some decisions that she chose to scale back and you know again when you think about what that tipping point is we it's hard to know sometimes the older people feel uncomfortable in situations that require complex planning and thinking and they choose\nTo not do things like Dr but then there might be other times I'm such a case of my grandmother when there are other unsafe situations that really had to intervene upon\nAnd it's it can get very ugly because again it's a disagreement\nBetween you know your family member who you think is impaired and everybody else who really sees the unsafe things that are happening\nYou mentioned the affair that are ... and since Justice O'Connor a as an example is that somebody who can advocate on behalf of Alzheimer's and that she's dealing with it herself or or is unlikely to do so is she\nWrote trenches from public life um that does then sometimes fall to doctors to do a and and you wanted to point out to invent this weekend\nYeah so this weekend on Saturday is to walk and Alzheimer's in Houston and it's at the University of Houston campus I should have looked at the time when I said that I was going to talk about it they\nWill posted a link to more information fantastic after Houston matter started work\nIt's a wonderful event and again it's one of those events where you see so many family members caregivers and health care professionals but who is really missing from the event is the family meant that the patients themselves\nThere are definitely some older people who are clearly affected by the elements who come out and walk and certainly it's a perfect event because walking is one of the best interventions for people with dementia even with severe dementia so it's a really moving moving event and I encourage people to attend or at least to donate to a team\nDoctor Holly homes is director of the division of geriatric and palliative medicine at the govern medical school at UT health Isabel Valdez is a physician's assistant and instructor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of medicine is about Dr Holmes thanks very much thinking much\nStill to come visit a refuge we're conservationists are trying to bring an endangered bird back from the edge of ... extinction stay with us is used in matters continue [noise]\nThis album bottle it in his front loaded with lots of more immediately charming\nMusic such as floating zone with it's lovely melody and its use of parking spaces as a metaphor for the pressures of daily life\nKnown as late thirties vial sounds like one of the most well adjusted pop musicians around\nThere is a generosity of spirit that pervades many of the new songs a willingness to accept other people's character flaws while freely acknowledging his own he's written a song called hysteria that's one of the least hysterical pop songs I can think of [noise]\nTimes I'm inclined to think vial doesn't work all that hard once he decides he needs to complete a rhyme\nThe ... from hysteria that goes girl you gave me rabies and I don't mean maybe that paraphrase from gene been since Nineteen fifties hit ... at the end of the line is either a clever or an easy way out\nBut then I remember that this is what via labor's to do to send you sailing along on his stream of consciousness\nNowhere is this more evident than on his ethic of ...

lawsuit I personally and I think our whole company would would disagree with that lawsuit and say that that is not inappropriate my position to take\nAnd it's especially a inappropriate when kids not presented or\nOr anyone else in Texas has presented an alternative I'm fine with talking about\nHow we to amend the Affordable CARE Act or how we might replace the Affordable CARE Act let's have a

very briefly offer some thoughts on how uh the ... could be improved\nYes we need to have the ability to have more flexibility\nIn the benefits offered it's a very rich benefit package and I think there's some people would like to have less her benefits that's actually been talked about by some people and so I think that's a reasonable approach or we need to look at the age and risk bands there's a the way the Affordable CARE Act was set up but it\nEnded up this incentivizing younger people like\nAre charging them higher premiums but the\nOpposite of that is true for older people that the uh premiums are lower than they would have been otherwise we need to have a difficult but adult conversation about how do you balance between getting more young people insured and still protecting older folks\nWe also need to continue to let states have more flexibility in the administration or the program there's a lot of administrative expenses that we have because of the federal requirements\nThe good news is actually that uh there's proposal for give states more flexibility under what's called at Thirteen thirty two waiver\nAnd it's time protects us to actually look at what

four zero eighty eight Seventy or talk at Houston matters start let's start with a few election related developments region days here in Texas a first there have been some complaints\nThat people choosing to vote during early voting is there and and I'm trying to do a straight ticket ballad are finding that as they review their selections before casting their vote or it may be one selection flips from a candidate they wanted to do a candidate they didn't want\nNow according to the Texas secretary of state's office this is not a problem with the voting machines it's that it's a human error or some have been arguing that the voting machines are outdated and apt to express\nThe ... it up a but the secretary of state's office of single voters are hitting a button or using the selection we'll be for the strings finished rendering\nAnd then the process be selecting a pre filled candidates selection of this is also happened apparently during past election cycles both political parties are warning voters not to rush as they cast their votes what are you making this [laughter]\n[noise] well the fighting machines are out of date first off less just admitted there over there Eighteen under analog machines for good in there and a lot in their Eighteen years old I was on the committee that picked these voting machines and this machine was not might pick by the way\nUm because I didn't like the dial a but and I didn't think it would hold up long term which it turned out to be a bit problematic and I also think our safety and security on these machines to Saturday time for the county to step up and get new machine\nIt's like having rotary phones for for for the county for you know for emergency services for goodness sakes I'm for it begs the question the ballot integrity that's the real question here and Nancy this is noted that that the machines are untrustworthy that they are quirky that the software stinks\nI'm against like using windows three point one I'm In an era of you know when we left in windows ten for God's sakes\n[noise] ah what about the advice of take your time out\nOf the best the best thing about these machines is that you get a final review of your ballot said before you hit that cast a ballot button you should read everything that it says you voted for him and that takes a minute men and\nIf you come across something that is not what you intended before you hit that casts about button you can ask for assistance from somebody else going on there and they'll help you to go back in and get to the point where you make\n... and it's not that hard to do and the fun thing as the other thing is wait till twenty twenty when we no longer have straight ticket voting\nYeah [laughter] that's the really come\nTexas attorney general Ken Paxton has been ramping up voter fraud prosecutions recently why\nAh it's five days till election or sees me six days it'll heal action among other things um it is also justification for voter id and the use of voter id in the state of Texas\nRight because they'll have another challenge I'm voter id ah both port wise and in the legislature next session so he is collecting cases to prove they are actually is voter fraud in our environment\nIt's more of a case of of of a of the solution in search of a problem rising\nState Sen Paul Bettencourt in Harris County clerk stand

you know for a while he was really into filming movies in Texas so I mean I think it kind of have to bend the rules for that those those movies a little bit but they are considered horror films um maybe not complete ones [noise]\nAnd then one that I was really proud that I thought of because it's not the first thing you think of even the title might suggest that is a ghost story\nBy a few\nRemember you know maybe\nTo make sure you're still around\nMostly went into a ghost story which came out\nA couple of years ago thinking oh it's going to be a scary movie and it's by David Lowry who lives in Texas to that movie is not exactly what you think I mean there is a ghost there is a person wearing a sheet it's a an artistic movie um and kind of caught people off guard but I Would include that went in there just because it's something completely different\nLet's start with the Texas Chainsaw massacre because if you say horror in Texas that's the first thing someone's going to think of Texas in the title I talk about the original ... the original Nineteen Seventy four movie\n... you know it's bizarre it's gruesome it's it's a little bit upsetting well I think you know if you think about how a film has evolved obviously and and and what we're what what's allowed on screen today has changed\nSo I think why that movie was so popular like I could give you an endless examples of movies today that come out that still shocked the audience\nAnd that's what was happening in Seventy four it was it really was based in independent movie that surprise people because they didn't have studio requirements saying you know you have to do this you have to get this you have to get a PG Thirteen writing\nAnd those are the types of movies not just Texas Chainsaw massacre but in all other horror movies that were coming out during that time period\nThat we're breaking boundaries and doing things that other horror movies wasn't and I think that's why it became popular and banned in some areas because it was so graphic and violent\nAnd then like you said because Texas is in the title and because the original created such a stir it it was an incentive for studios\nTo keep reimagining that over and over and over for a different generation to them and it was even surprising to me who I reviewed the modern versions and I was even shocked\nAt how many of these I've actually sit down to the um and just to build as the star one of them met but where was the star one of them I mean we're ... another Texan and Matthew McConaughey another tax and they got their start in one of the many Texas Chainsaw massacre franchises I mean so it's even it's even spawned careers\n... something that we also sort of touched on in our conversations before was this idea of the rural setting you know Texas Chainsaw massacre is kind of set in the middle of nowhere ... what is it about that rural southern us sort of setting that\nThat makes such effect of horror well so yeah maybe we can give Texas Chainsaw massacre a little bit of credit for starting that but I think that's a trend that really spread like wildfire and I mean that's really the setting and almost every single horror movie you know isolation is terrifying\nI I've always said in my reviews its really challenging or really impressive when a horror movie can scare you in daylight because most Mormons do you think they're isolated it's dark it's usually raining there is a storm or something\nSo yeah I mean it it certainly traits that fear but you know I think that's something that works for outside of Texas because for us living here in Houston and Galveston Dallas wherever the city we don't necessarily think of Texas like that\nYou know so that is something that these movies are playing\nTo people that live outside the states that are not thinking about Texas as an urban community or you know full of huge cities like we're ... we know of it so\nSo yeah I mean I I can see why that is appealing and as far as saying films in Texas we have some other uh examples you'd like to discuss okay so there are other movies that are filmed in Texas that can kinda straddle the fence as far as horror goes\nOne of them you could certainly make an argument that no country for old men has them horrific elements to it and now there are some that obviously went on to win best picture it by the Coen brothers\n[noise]\nWalk dress code\nWe know we're going for you you're going\nI jumped coat [noise]\nDo pick up your whole life just\nNow that the west Texas thing but I mean there's certainly some really really disturbing things in that movie nocturnal animals a recent one that Tom Ford shot in El Paso also west Texas with Jake Gyllenhaal Amy Adams army hammer is also\nLike to call me and not turn away [noise] I didn't make sense when\nMaking about lately and recently she sent me this ... page [noise] dedicated to me [noise]\nSo that's another movie that I think that straddles the fence a poor has some horrific elements to it and very upsetting scary and then finally I just one of my favorite movies in general it's a cardio the drug cartel Emily Blunt uh the sequel just came out this year beneath deal del Toro\n[noise] gone\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nFind yourself very scared in in films like that where you know they don't\nThe get tapped his heart and I think hard sometimes gets a bad rap because we think of it can't be labeled horror unless it's about a slasher killer or something like that but there's other horse scenarios that we can think of\nAnd then as you mentioned outside of Texas just some briefly I was trying to look in the south western eastern area one of my favorite films that I guess you would consider a horror movie will be the gift of the San ... version of the gift not the ... version\nYou're listening to me I'm a combat with me and said her the way and [noise]\nAll right [noise] I don't know how\nThe gift was a kind of a movie that slipped under the radar it was Cate Blanchett Hilary Swank Keanu Reeves Jk simmons now has an Oscar Katie Holmes I mean it was a huge cast rural setting it was ... in Georgia um I thought that was a really great film and then get out of course that we just saw last year that was shot in Alabama even though it wasn't set in Alabama\nThank God for [noise]\n\nI Want to kind of go back to it to where you were talking about with this idea that\nNot all horror is the same basically you know you talked about some of these movies straddle line ... they're not outright marketed as horror movies\nBut they still have some of these pretty horrific elements in no country for old men has probably one of the most effective villains of of a film in a very long time and he compare him to a famous villain like leather face\nYeah first of all the ... performance and that some not only made his career um he he was fantastic and you know you could easily can you can put ... character in that next the heath Ledger's joker you could put that you know in the screen face all those guys\nAnd at the end of the day you have to ask yourself as a viewer what are you more terrified by are you more terrified by some\nUnrealistic guy and a sheet that is trying to kill people in the woods or a madman that is not interested in hiding his face because he's coming after you no matter what I mean like you said you're about them is way more terrifying it'd be really sit down and think about it than any of these supernatural killers\nSo I think that's what works for that film and I'm In that film just a a a great film out even outside of the thrilling elements I mean what the Coen brothers did with that movie was pretty phenomenal and it still holds up today if you go back and watch it and it and that you know that the movie I think Texas can really be proud of\nSo so living in Texas in thinking about the horror genre are there opportunities for something new is there some creative vein that could be used for an effective horror film\nAbsolutely and before I can answer that I must say because I Would be terrible if I didn't mention the fact that the reason that so many of these films are not shot in Texas\nI mean for instance like hell or high water the Jeff Bridges amazing and that was nominated for best picture two years ago that film couldn't even be shot in Texas because Texas does not offer incentives for filmmakers\nSo that is a big road blocks for all these films even if they're set in Texas they have to go some in Utah or in Mexico or somewhere else in a state that will offer them this tax incentives\nSo that's something that I Hope one day will change and we can see all those productions come back to Texas and certainly create more jobs and I think you'd see a lot more movies especially smaller ones being filmed here if we could get that going that being said yes I mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Houston Matters", "city": "Houston", "day": "31"}
