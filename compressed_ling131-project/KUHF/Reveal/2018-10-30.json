something else went all all that data on developmental delays in the ... babies be released\nWhy I think there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I get from doctor to notice on almost everything we talk about she is hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation she tells me that she needs to get permission from her boss the health secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I can talk to anybody Whitney without being authorized because we want to have a knee correct message\nYou left me a key my first day average scene was gone I woke up and it was like she just bust here and there was a key to stay at home\nIt didn't take long for the needs to find a job at a pharmaceutical plant packing and shipping but just a few weeks after she moved in with Pam Harvey hit and Denise of housing search suddenly got way tougher Harvey damage to more than forty percent of Houston's houses and apartment buildings [noise]\nThere was a lot more competition for what was left and the vouchers expired in his little as two months if you don't find a place in time so she had the phone [noise]\nMy name is Denise I was caught in a reference to your apartments for rent\nDenise is voucher would let her rent a two bedroom apartment costing up to fourteen hundred dollars a month with the government paying maybe half of that she found plenty of apartments within that price range neighborhood she liked\nAnd my next question is do you guys take the house and choice voucher so you do or you don't at all okay that's okay thank you [noise]\nThe nice made dozens of calls like this everyone said no\nA month after Harvey hit and then two months Denise was still staying with than an apartment manager's we're still telling her no in some parts of the u._s. it's illegal to reject or rent or just because they have a voucher it's considered discrimination that's not true in Texas though which I'll explain more later\nIf if the grading and if you're not morally if you're not built up morally it can really put you on a you know depressed kind of face like when am I you know it'll make you put yourself in a category that you're not in\nOne out of every four families in Houston never seems voucher never gets to use it that's according to the Houston housing authority Denise was worried she'd have to give hers back\nWhy don't you say fixing it what's wrong with sex right\nDenise thinks this isn't about her voucher she thinks it's because she's black like most about your holders we ran the numbers and found that almost Ninety percent of families and the Houston area with vouchers are African American most of them live in areas with the city's highest poverty rate\nThe way that he sees it she's deliberately being steered toward the poorest and most racially segregated neighborhoods [noise]\nLocal housing officials recognize that this is a problem and that Houston is actually one of the most\nSegregated cities in the country a few years ago the Houston housing authority tried to take a small step to address the issue it didn't go well [noise]\n\nOfficials had this idea to build a mixed income apartment building in a wealthier part of town called the Galleria it's known to this giant glitzy mall with an ice skating rink [noise] some of the units in the building would have to accept vouchers getting poorer families access to better schools but hundreds of angry he's donations revolted\nHere's [noise]\n\nBack in twenty six team they showed up in force to a public meeting at the neighborhood elementary school it was standing room only lasted for\nHours almost all the people in the crowd were white they complained that the building was too expensive way overcrowded schools lower property values\nOr\n\n[noise] people's\nAnd written comments to one person complained about what they called pollution upscale neighborhoods with the poor [noise]\nOnly a few people spoke up in favor of the proposal including a woman named Chris ... says\nHe really does you know\nOf course I was black and she works for a housing advocacy group she told the audience the people who want to live here are you are janitors if you've reached as your wait staff\nSo we didn't want to hurt [noise]\n\n\nWhen this whole debate was going on Pamela banks was watching it unfold and thinking about our clients these apartments could have helped them\nIf they could move that neighborhood with a voucher they could get a leg up but the project was killed not long after that public hearing I called him recently and played her some of the tape\nThe part where the guy talks about compassion for people who need affordable housing but also that poison grapes Pam told me it made her think about how after the hurricane people set up animal shelters on that side of town\n... for one you evaluate once you're in a while\nThere's a reason pan is saying we and us here for her it's personal in her late twenties after she and her husband separated him landed in Houston as a single mom she applied for a section ... voucher and waited for seven years to get one\nWhen she finally got her voucher back in Nineteen Ninety seven pounds spent months searching for a place that would take it one day she came across this listing the brick house with a fireplace in the suburbs in an area known for better schools so she drove out there to meet the landlord\nIt was raining up there and it was it but you know but America later they were going to be inducted she got out toward the house\nPam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave\nShe went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\nSaid okay you said and I have a housing you know I Know you\nMay not know about housing scenario stereotype image detected so afraid about it and let me know if you want to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after pan and the kids moved in she bought her own house\n[noise]\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise from\nRejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal it's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey\n[noise] a few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they banned any other city\nIn Texas from doing the same thing [noise] basically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter the she understand that some people don't take ... to take our church and she got that what she she gave that\nTo a certain extent but I don't know how to understand uh [noise] uh [noise] that discrimination or part of it [noise] I don't want her to feel stereotype because of a voucher\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes\nBoth majority white very low poverty better schools put out of a Seventeen thousand families that get ... from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those in post so what's going on here why are so many landlord unwilling to take out or is in Texas\nBut I don't think there's you know the ... section a discriminatory too little\nThis is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they noticed section eight after it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacey on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits alleging that discrimination against voucher holders when you say to that\nAnd disagree with that but I think that the ... and many situations you know they choose to live or their support group for their families were transportation where their job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey hunt about Denise\nShould just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nBut it's reflective of because everyone has to do with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\nThrough for this lady so I Would advise or the cold to people in this quest\nNest quest we'd heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad he sent officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and wanted
