{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Let's turn now to the NFL the Houston Texans finally won a game it well I think that even though it's not just the sheer way that they will get to that okay well okay so they held off the colds thirty seven thirty four and overtime after squandering uh twenty eight to ten third quarter lead so what did they do well what do they do well\nWell okay let's start with some positive first of all defensively they from us pass rush standpoint they looked like a team the team that a lot of people wanted them to be to daddy incline he was a human wrecking machine as was J J what this is exactly now conversely the Colts have ...\nOffensive line and we're not been good all year but the Texans were in the backfield it seemed like all day long\nI'm Shawn Johnson was again very good at yet quarterback\nAnd the young rookie Kiki Kuti came in as a slot receiver had eleven catches over a hundred yards and his debut they ran him a lot in the backfield with odd reverses and Mr actions that was the good stuff I think on the bad side you know they gave us they came into the game as day Andrew Luck had not thrown a pass for more than thirty five yards all year\nAnd I just jokingly said on Twitter that will change today three plays into the game he threw in for forty yards I think the thing is is that from a past events the Texans just were not good they gave up Eighteen points\nThey had no business winning this game if not for like one of the most bizarre play calls that I've ever personally seen in a game in overtime by the colds those actions would not have won this game they probably ended up time this game if not for that\nTo soccer now the Houston died of a claim the u._s. open cup last Wednesday with a three nothing went over Philadelphia is this a win this franchise can build off of\nYes and no I think on one hand it's great you know it it it is a prestigious award it's ... it's an important one it it lends to some things later where they can play international play and that sort of thing I'm On the other side though\nIt speaks to some of the deficiencies they've had over the course of their season you know the difference between a tournament and the seasons and tournament you catch fire\nSuddenly be really good and sort of run the table you have to but to win over the course of the season you have to be consistently good for a long period of time and I think it's sort of amplify some of those deficiencies they've had being consistent over whole season\nBut from a standpoint of this tournament it's great for them and I think it's it's always good to win something like that\nThat said the data also defeated San jose three Saturday and MLS play with four games left in the season they are now five points out of that eighth and final play out and bought in the western conference I mean they'd need help certainly a lot but is it so outrageous to think the dynamo have shot\nIf not outrageous but they play most of their games on the road to finish the season we know they have not been good they're\nA Salt Lake city sort of help save their season a little bit by tying in against sporting Casey in Kansas City uh which I don't think anybody expected them to do I just think it's highly there is no one that writes about the MLS on the regular that thinks the dynamo we're going to be in the playoffs\nI think it's just a very highly unlikely that they will make it but look they are a team that seems to have gotten better as the season progressed and you saw it come through in that in the in the tournament play so we'll see\nAnything's possible but I Would say at this point it's very doubtful\nTeam wins big games can maybe when the games again you'd like to think so yeah with a couple on the road that nobody expects and suddenly\nYeah you'd you'd like to believe that will see\nThe Houston Rockets preseason scheduled against a bar with a game against the grizzlies what will you look for during the pre season\nMostly I'm looking at two things chemistry for one how are these new guys fitting in how it's not just Carmelo Anthony but how is James and spinning in Michael Carter Williams what does it rotations kind of looking like\nSecond thing is how are they competing defensively that's really going to be the key for them I think all season long the rockets think that they will be as good if not better than they were defensively\nI'm Still a little skeptical of that but I I think they have a chance reading James and this is much better defender than people think I think Michael Carter Williams is very good so we'll see um I I those are the things I'll be looking for in the pre season for sure you know pretty soon ... incredibly boring\nShould we anticipate any other roster moved before the beginning of the regular season\nYou know the Jimmy butler thing is still out there floating around I don't know if the rockets are going to be able to make that deal happen and I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure I Would depending upon what what the players are involved but it's still out there and tell that settled I don't think we know for sure I still think it's somewhat unlikely um but we'll have to keep an eye on it\nOr they predictions for the Astros and Cleveland\nI think the actors are going to win I think probably it's a you know I think they're probably gonna win in short order\n... he writes for Hugh Sonia magazine and the Houston Press he joined us most Mondays to discuss developments in Houston sports Jeff thanks very much thanks very

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says vote on the nominee will happen this week and he blasted Democrats are continuing to go after cabinet\nIf you listen carefully must are proud of that you can practically hear the south of the Democrats moving the goalposts\nTrump says he wants a comprehensive investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh but also once you're done quickly and continues to stand by as nominee\nPresident Trump is celebrating a new agreement with Canada and Mexico today as a story and terrific trade deal the U.S Mexico Canada agreement will replace NAFTA add some new provisions as well ... has an update Trump\nCampaign none of vowed to renegotiate NAFTA but until this weekend it wasn't clear if Canada would be on board\nSticking points included cows and cars the deal let the American dairy farmers sell mortgage to Canada and requires a higher percentage of the cars parts can be made in North America it also calls for higher wages for auto workers the president says the deal is good for everyone\nBut we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and trade\nCanada and Mexico are promised exemptions from ... but not from America's steel terrorists the deal still needs to be approved by Congress can you know what I'm asking NPR News\nI'm tempted immigration officials defending a plan by the Trump Administration to deny green cards to immigrants who use public benefits NPR's Joel Rose explains the head of the agency in charge of illegal immigration spoke about the proposed rule change today\nThe head of US citizenship and immigration services ... wants to ensure that immigrants are self sufficient by enforcing a long standing law that immigrants cannot be a quote public charge\nUnder a proposed rule the administration wants to expand the definition of public charge to include a wide range of benefits including food assistance and housing vouchers\nOlder talk more about the ... were first told me about how to need it and Wilson medium uses a staff from the ice box\nIn the middle of the night and then what happens\nThey called the neat as name and she's told to bring her son and she describes having to walk over people to make our way out of the ... and she goes into another room that she describes as a sort of hallway room that's full of benches and that's where she is with Wilson and a whole bunch of other kids\nBut they're all teenagers that except for her son and remember he's just six years old at the time\nThey all weight and the kids are called one by one and finally the ... calls with his son's name\nThan either has always described Wilson as a very obedient little kid and so when we're sitting here is his name he just goes towards the door and then eat that runs after him to try and say goodbye and at first glance says that she can't do that\nSo many shows but I Can't put 'em in equal\nIn Missouri so these are ... in Missouri who is [noise]\nShe says he basically tells her look I'm I'm just doing my job but he does let her say goodbye\nGeneral [noise]\nShe hugs Wilson and she told me she she couldn't even talk she just she had no voice left\nYou may not have it I mean it was so little\nBut only about\n... million I must say\nShe wonders if with on is going alone she wonders where he's going she tries to ask for information but they won't tell her\nOne of the things about this is that a lot of the people who worked for envy them transporting the kids\nThey're often almost kids themselves the metro LA is is twenty four years old he's a college student he's a veteran he's don't eat that age and I want to show you this picture that he posted on Facebook it was just three days after he had taken with son away from tiny\nThat it's a picture of him in a tree with his mom under him and he's holding a cute young relative I imagine a kid you maybe three to five years old he's got a ... like your T shirt on\n'em and the caption the side of the photo is a love my mama\nI mean he had just taken with his son away from his on my mind just a few days before\nAnd it's difficult to know what's going to his mind when she posts this but there's a [noise]\nThere's definitely an iron here [noise]\n\nI Know you left a lot of messages for ... and having gotten response so we just don't know what he thinks about his individual role in all this but I gotta say I'm just so struck that this is a brown man taking a brown boy from his brown ma\nIf you think about it it's sort of makes sense because so many people who are apprehended at the border do speak Spanish and so I think it facilitates that communication if you want to take a child from their parent why not say it in their language\nI mean behind all of this there are serious questions about race how race plays into these larger policy decisions\nYou have to reflect upon the fact that when Donald Trump was on the campaign trail he called Mexican immigrants rape is he said they bring drugs and crime and then when he becomes president his administration implemented a zero tolerance policy and family separation\nAnd to do all that we're learning that the government is relying on pay contractors private American citizens to do the work of separating children from their parents\nWe think of the government or border patrol or some nebulous entity that is taking these kids but these are individual people who made this process happen\nAnd what did envy him have to say about this\nI've asked envy and for an interview many times throughout my reporting when I contacted this time they decline but spokesman justice Arab it sent me a along email that included the following statement he wrote and I quote\nIt would be inaccurate to describe envy am or any of its employees of quote taking or separating a child from his or her parent\nThat authority rests solely with a responsible government agency and quote\nSo and the M Ms making this distinction and saying that there's a government agency that's accountable here\nBut don't eat that knows who basically took her son away from her and we just one recognized him too it's not a uniformed officer of the United states government it was a ... a polo shirts and ...\nAnd Ambien aims rationalization for this is basically saying like a ... let's say I was trying to build something at two pieces of wood I Need a nail to hold them together and I use a hammer to drive that Neal into the woods\nI cannot excuse the hammer from that ... if I don't have the hammer the nail doesn't go into the woods in this case MGM as the hammer there as a tool that is actually going out and separating these children from their pairs\nAnd so basically the people who got their hands dirty was envious [noise]\nThey got their hands dirty in their pockets pretty full [noise]\nTwenty fourteen envy him his secured government contracts worth up to two hundred and twenty five million dollars for the transportation of immigrant children\nIn July as press secretary ... told us that envy him is authorized to use office spaces as wading areas for miners\nAwaiting same day transportation she also said these offices are not overnight housing that's a part of the contract so we requested a list of locations where envy them was authorized to hold children but I told us no such record exists\nMeaning I student track where Ambien was keeping all those kids for their part envy him has declined to tell us how many officers use to keep children overnight or where those officers are located [noise]\nWhen we come back we'll subtle is is what it was like to live inside that Phoenix office bill\nSurrounded by strangers you're listening to reveal from the center for

describes as where he slept in the office very abstract children's art but you can sort of see you again\nBut by the fall twenty Seventeen lawyers and journalists were documenting some of the first case\nFamily separation was beginning\nThen the spring\nThe caravan happened\nA caravan of immigrants marching towards America where we live we begin with a caravan at the border nearly two hundred men women and children are hoping to step foot on us soil\nHundreds of immigrants many fleeing violence in Central America traveled to the U.S Mexico border and many of them plans to enter the United states at a border crossing and official port of entry [noise] their goal to claim asylum legally\nAre you watching mess that's going on right now we're coming\n\nThe caravans were some in the to the president who promised to be tough on immigration especially because he couldn't do much to stop them but he could crack down on people who cross illegally\nTolerance policy attorney general Jeff Sessions laying down the law with a brand new immigration crackdown\nRight at the border of Jeff Sessions said zero tolerance would work\nIf you're a lawyer subject yourself to prosecution\nIn other words sessions wants every single person who crosses illegally to be prosecuted for federal crime known as improper entry by aliens and he wants them to go to jail even parents traveling with young children\nNon citizens across borders unlawfully which show that they are the ones who broke the law\nThey are the ones who are endangered their own shoulder\nWith parents facing incarceration\nThe administration argued it had no choice but separate kids and kids can't go to jail with their parents [noise]\nSuddenly family separations exploded\nAnd no longer was being described as some radical new policy now the White House it was about enforcing the law cracking down on people who cross illegal [noise]\nWe've been looking into this claim need us to do with our partners at the Texas Tribune loans reveals on the on CBS court is had been following one family from a\nFamily you first heard about on our show back in June [noise] when they crossed the border this summer this family says they did everything in their power to follow the law they were prosecuted for crossing illegally\nYet for some reason they were still touched by every aspect of Trump's family separation policy\nNina takes

ready for foreign grandkids and her daughter Sandy she thought they'd be here weeks ago but I did it on my list that the employer and the enemy has\nHe may you'll have got a call from Sandy [noise] she was with her kids all boys ages twelve eight five and the youngest the baby\nJust a few months old and they've been travelling for weeks and now they were standing at an official port of entry abridged stretching over the Rio Grande name before crossing\nThey dialed ... music and I mean apple to command model the kids called me before getting in line to surrender to border patrol has happened in the ... they said that in line they gave the baby a happy birthday hug because he was turning five months he may semi either they told me yeah and we're about to surrender to border patrol\nSandy and the kids were coming to claim asylum look at me some money I said okay my last and first God willing we'll see each other very soon see my my eight I said what if it\nDidn't look at OK lieutenant Sacramento beat them with against yes moment in the winter because as soon as we arrive we want you to take us to eat pizza or hamburgers okay my loves whatever you want to see I'm ... years but I Am a few days\nPast then you've got another call from Sandy she was in border patrol custody\nBut at least ... ... known as the sad part was when my daughter called me on Monday I mean she said yeah I'm here with the kids but they just told me that they're going to take away the kids why for gay\nWhy is a good question\nFor a member of the Trump Administration says family separation was all about enforcing the law prosecuting people who are crossing illegally\nBut Sandy says she did everything by the book she went to a bridge and waited in line she turned herself over the border patrol and important entry it's one of the many ways to claim asylum and it's all totally legal\nBut Sandy's kids were taken from her anyway and sent to states away to Arizona and she got locked up in an immigration detention center called port is about the southern tip attacks and\n\nIt's really hard for reporters to get into immigration detention centers to do interviews but it's different if

too\nIt was a really busy day I had to wait two hours to get a visitation room and then they brought me her\nSandy was scored it into the room she was wearing a blue jumpsuit or because she was friendly well composed\nI think I said my name is ruby ... turning I'm here to help you\nOne of these last meetings before heading back to Houston\nAnd I thought I'm just going to talk to her for a little bit and then I'm going to go but when she started telling me her story I it's almost like time slow down and all I could think about was what she was saying\nWhat Sandy said is that\nBack in Guatemala she'd been abused her life threatened local police and gang members targeted her and her family\nI've seen records from the Guatemalan national police step back some of this up for her safety were not disclosing her full name or her kids in eight years ago Sandy had tried coming to the U.S illegally and got deported\nBecause of that it's unlikely she'll be able to get asylum\nNow but she is eligible for something you could call asylum light which could allow her to stay in the U. S. and work\nRuby says Cindy's case to stay here is a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to port Isabel Sandy also told Rudy about her four sons she hadn't seen them in about a month she described a moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me that the guard said she had to take her baby away\nShe said but I'm Still breastfeeding and you know and there's a does it matter she snow but I'm a breast feeding and they said oh we sell to take 'em and\nDid our [noise] God Forbid took breastfeeding abate oh is\nIt just couldn't believe it [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] I don't know what else to say about that\n\nI was never able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone\nSandy happened to call while I was visiting his apartment in Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\nFor our\nFamily and ended up how are you my daughter\n[noise] factor that outlined\nSandy says she's desperate to leave I left is going did you talk to the kids money\n[noise]\nBut I ... that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with her she asks if you'll have been able to talk with him\nHe may have to get all it'd be a ... a a meal that\nYes because on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids any semi me he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go if you don't mind me\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished it's the children to [noise] when Sandy says this year the looks like she's about to cry\nNow that let me know that the truth me I don't have words for you and I understand you as a mother\n\nKenny tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the warmth of his mother\nDo say ... yes and that was something else to children complained about that they don't let the kids how the baby not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old almost all the way how is that possible that they don't let them hug each other and I might be a new cells that but as they are brothers they have never been apart\n", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "02"}
