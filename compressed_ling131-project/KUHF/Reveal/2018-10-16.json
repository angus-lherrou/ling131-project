really sort of use a lot of those guys in an attempt to sort of winning the first couple of games and similar fashion I think with with what has happened in a little bit in Boston\nBut to a more extreme degrees they just don't have the same number of arms\nI think the Dodgers are set up pretty well but I wouldn't count spurs that I think that could be a longer series than the AFC us\nAll right let's turn to football after a dreadful oh in three start the Texans have won three straight including Sundays twenty Thirteen ... against the buffalo the Texans\nTo find themselves in a three way tied for first place in the AFC South to what do you attribute this turnaround in the standings [laughter]\nYou know you said there have been like I don't know if I Can't remember the word but basically the ugly three losses they were ugly three when Jimmy\nThey played bad teams you know the NFL is nothing if not filled with parity I mean you look around and there's only a one undefeated team a couple was one ... one when the rest are just three and two two and three you know one in four it's there's a lot of that mix and\nThe Texans are in that mix they play in a bad division and and they played against the real bad teams it's taken them to over times in a pick fixing the fourth quarter to win them\nDoes not exactly like they're playing great football but hey when is a win at this point\nIt's nice though to be on the other side isn't it six is late in the the football game\nYeah yeah it is and I think look again if you're the Texans you take them any way you can get them and defensively they've they've been good you know are they they've been one of the better teams I think recently defensively off instantly there's still a train wreck and you know they're just going to have to try and figure that out and better to be doing that tied for the division leave them to be doing it from the seller\nThere was concern heading in this Sunday's game that the Sean watching might not play or might be hobbled after getting knocked around so badly in recent weeks how they look\nNot great I mean he had two interceptions one that wasn't entirely his fault he had a couple of ... one that was he recovered and one that was turned over\nLook he has beat up you've got hit twelve more times in this game sack seven more times they just cannot allow him to get beat up like that back there is some of it is his fault you know he is the type of guy who wants to do everything he can to make a play regardless of what harm it does to him\nBut some of it is on this team just bad offensive line and and real offensive struggles\nUh they've got to protect him and he's not going to make it through the season\nThe Houston Rockets closed out the NBA preseason friday with a one Twenty one one of the three went over the grizzlies or the rockets ready to roll\nYeah I think they are the rotation seem to be set the roster is set they have one injury to Sochi who's not really going to play a significant role in their interpretation so yeah they're ready to go\nFirst separate pelicans Wednesday night followed by game against the Lakers on Saturday and the clippers Sunday what will you watch for in these first few games\nI think it's really I Want to see their rotations and I want to see their defensive intensity throughout these games look the rockets on a talent level and on and off into level are going to beat a lot of teams just because they're just better than they are\nUm I'm going to be interested to see how they maintain that intensity sort of winning intensity that defensive intensity\nUh that's going to be the most interesting to me and I think will be the key to see how they're going to progress throughout the year\nIt appears Jimmy Butler will start the season with the Minnesota timber maybe a but reportedly the tables are still pursuing a trade partner for him or any chance at all that could be the rockets\nI don't think so at this point you know that the someone for Tito had it in a statement a week or so ago saying that uh they weren't going to trade away their core\nA breakup their chemistry in order they want to address the butler they'd like to the reports are that Minnesota wants to not only are recording but also PJ Tucker which I think is probably a mistake he is so important as a player to what they do on both ... and defense that really kind of wrecked their chemistry\nJimmy ... is a great player but I don't think you give them up if it means destroying the opportunity to be really really good and I think that is a possibility\nBefore we wrap up we learned last week that former rockets coach and NBA offensive ... winter has died what's winters legacy and we got to be a\nWell he invented literally wrote the

came to port and he says he found out his mother was very ill\nHe tells me he's trying to get back to be with her\nAt this point we're just waiting for a call from Iowa in Vietnam\nSo Tom can learn
