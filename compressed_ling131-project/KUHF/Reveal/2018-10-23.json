has weakened somewhat as it heads toward land though by any measure it remains a powerful category for storm Daniel Brown as a forecaster with the national Hurricane Center\nThe system is forecast to be an extremely dangerous hurricane as it approaches the coast on Tuesday or we're expecting an extremely dangerous storm surge along with a damaging hurricane force winds as well as the potential for flooding rainfall\nTheir problem Helen Kimmo faced hasn't gone away earlier this month voting rights groups filed a lawsuit claims Brian camps office\nThis violated the voting rights act in the constitution and issue is a law that freezes applications for name or other info doesn't exactly match other government records even if it's just missing a hyphen ... people can still vote but activists worried they might be discouraged by the confusion\nAnd they bond fund says there's another voter suppression strategy that still has him stumped it first dawned on him in twenty twelve\nYou're reading an article that the number of registered voters in Georgia had gone down\nThis raise serious questions because we knew Georgia's population was growing up you know there had not been the black death to kill off a third of the state's population and so we're going to be somewhere else going on\nSo here's what's happening to bond earns missing voters states routinely perch hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call it use it or lose at laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nWorks like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state sends you a mailer if you don't respond and skip to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know you removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's been a massive jumped in purchase\nWhat's going on here Brian camps job is to protect our vote and this is an ad from power pack Georgia its donors promised ten million dollars to boost Stacey Abrams campaign we just can't trust that Brian camp\n[noise] can stay on a bus tour around the state talking about his record I went to his stops south of Atlanta outside spray varies barbecue restaurant just regular campaign stop for Georgia Republican [noise]\nPeople [noise]\nKemp steps off the bus and gives his stump speech it's all about putting Georgia first and protecting its values then he gets back on the bus I get onto I asked him about the allegations that he'd been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nFlow and disagree with that statement lower noon is within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls [noise]\nNo I don't believe we have um and we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta obscure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nLaughing my mind [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia there's some concerns over there in line\nWith Angela ... she's an investigative reporter for a PM reporters and [noise] we've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year and our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie as any more than two dozen others\nThe purchase are disproportionately affecting people of color\nAnd she ran Wayne\nMoultrie is the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes streets along rows of one story ramshackle houses\n[noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed is perhaps some are boarded up and the residents had moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college for the military and as I Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nI think yes [noise]\nWe're still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to seek Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council hey how you doing but he's also a businessman\nAnd pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love he says his family's lived in the area for generations\nIt's my great grandparents uh there was small sharecroppers Reverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes she says well he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nThat came across all quite a few people and then that led to an Iranian some of them went down to vote and they could and then um I had to be said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusion like that during the ...\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe ... is no longer more to vote in there and I think that's what we're we're in trouble with\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nOn line there yeah yeah that is very much\nSteve record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year official struck her name from the rolls ... tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he and know that she's been taken\nOff the voting list Angela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside Moultrie\nMay have assigned for her I'm handle I can say that I'm a reporter Lance public radio for a story about people who send removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard of that they think\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate\nRight so you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I've heard that Obama is trying to remember\n... you know divorce thinking what I mean\nSo then uh last July he were taken off the voter last I Would have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen hands but you didn't get any notification that you\nDo need to know\nDid you know there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been perch although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes a bigger than the two back at Reverend ponders office Angela gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county like she's been removed from the voter last and she had no idea\nThat's interesting because she was never know the fact that they\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] no I think we need to get down to the bottom of it because if it happened to her\nTo Rome and she she she says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nBut almost give people the written mindset that this is a privilege not right and so now anything that is a privilege as they get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use this privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race\n[noise]\n\nWe analyze all the people purging Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notice\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor\nWhen it comes to the purges CVA rooms and other Democrats said there's a solution let people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration\nBut not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting Brian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house\nBrands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is alright period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nOn people who have been following the election to some degree now who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's had a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate Abad a how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nWhat about the voting rights act he says states were actively disenfranchising people than the government stepped in isn't that positive Kemp doesn't seem to understand the question\nI Would say that the voting rights act is still intact yes but it's an example of the opposite of what you were asserting it was an example of federalizing something to protect the franchise I don't believe because of the states weren't doing it in fact states were actively\nSuppressing boats you don't deny that do\nWell I'm not sure I understand what that has to do with the election system while I'm dealing with your assertion of the principle that we shouldn't federalize any aspect of this and I'm arguing that the voting rights act is it clear exception to your principal\nAnd that perhaps the federal government in federal elections at least has an interest that overrides state interests when it comes to protecting at the cyber level the integrity of the results well that's certainly your opinion on the first\n[noise] [noise] I ... at the end\nOf the hearing campus given one last chance to speak any stance from states have this cyber security stuff handled he says and in fact maybe federal officials should pay a visit maybe they would learn a few things I think there will be very pleasantly surprised\n[laughter] the team in Kennesaw state was certainly surprised in fact slogans email sent them scrambling [laughter]\nThey didn't want to be interviewed for this story but all their emails republic record which means you can get them if you ask nicely let's start on August twenty eight twenty sixteen Logan emails KFC he tell somebody found and he says quote there's a strong probability your site is already compromise\nMembers of cast youth center for election system starts circulating the email around and over the next few days they start to realize yeah this is that\nThe school's information security team recommends doing some scans but then the director of the elections team ways and he says wait a minute wait a minute this is our busiest time of year the last thing we want is for the site to become unavailable all these counties Nita [noise]\nReading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense but this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the elections this seems problematic by September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done someone from the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote\nWe've discovered we're a little out of our debt to find a way the elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first emailed them they think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us\nReading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like\nOh this is over except it's not [noise] you might be wondering what brain can't pass to say about all this well despite move inland downloading dreams sensitive information which camp called deeply concerning\nKemp also said that Georgia is protected which layers upon layers of security and specifically he's made two arguments number one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet which makes them safer from hacking\nAnd number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you need a wide scale conspiracy actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments\nAre wrong richton Milo is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech he used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nYou don't need to mount an attack on thousands and thousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word or target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above ...\nPlus he says because Georgia's system is so centralized there are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's part of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making it up they're scared to death and they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems that have no idea why they\nWork or don't work and they're kind of living in constant fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around two years\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy knows like\nChrist I ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found a K issue and he said no tell me more [laughter]\nThey sit down at a computer and download everything again except this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so were you able to get the exact same amount of stuff\nThe second time or effectively yeah sir nothing had changed well they had attempted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] those those by my reaction\n[laughter] [noise] I don't really understand [noise]\nKim didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat\nShe oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots from\nDead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake um they're just so many opportunities [noise] limited truly only by one to imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the universe\nTo be Michigan he studies theories ... vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree he told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting permission or indirect basically our a virus you any part of the tree the way it is set up your that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp\nFor violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly they asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms there was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom on the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed in order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create\nTotal chaos but she also spent\nDozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and\nScolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Schoenberg was having none of fat packing she wrote is here to stay\nAnd quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia for research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with informal systems in machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling election now the secretary of state's office does the people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen\nThey could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams\nAnd it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned\nReveals by Dr brought us that story\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission that will look at options for policing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh and the other four states heading into the midterms that used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "23"}
