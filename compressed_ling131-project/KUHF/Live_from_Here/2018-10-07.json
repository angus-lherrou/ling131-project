love wrestling taking that does raise in the food and great Nightline in San Francisco is for you I'm a software engineer and father to\nI'm resuming my journey across the country chairing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I was on a road trip traveling down along the northeastern Portland Maine to Long Island sound\nFall is slowly emerging but the leaves starting to turn in the last two summers warmth lingering in the air\nBut the locals know what's coming and could be seen pulling out their snow shovels and practicing they're unhappy winter faces\nThe first person I ran into was John working at a hotel shining shoes he's eighty six years old and decided to spend his retirement by working at yet another job\nWhat else am I going to do is walk around the mall and count my steps that sounds like the way they torture you on a Turkish prison I had it down to the war is looking for a lobster role and took a seat in an outdoor cafe overlooking the water\nI met a middle aged couple who are enjoying a drink in the sun from the playful way they interacted I thought they were on their first date but it turned out they'd been married for eleven years and funny enough still liked each other\nCarrion Brian met in Portland while attending a mini kiss concert\nMany kisses a kiss tribute band made up of all little people\n\nKerry said I walked in and saw Brian across the room because we were taller than everyone else\n[noise] I figured I Am wearing face makeup he's wearing face makeup we should make out\nHe squeezed your hand while she told their story we don't go out much anymore but we still love kids she showed me a picture on her phone of Brian with a giant beer belly dressed up in his very own kiss costume\nKerry said I like this picture because Brian looks like gene Simmons if he ate one of the guys from many kids [noise]\nIt was time for me to take it over to get my rental car for the journey down the coast I was picked up by Sean he's twenty five and it's been driving for the past three years ever since he lost his job at the moving company\nHe loves Maine but he's not looking forward to the cold\nHe said that the winter was so bad last year when spring finally came he throughout all his long pants and protest now he's in trouble\nHe said I saw the survivor show and discovery where a guy never wore shoes are pans he trained as mitochondria with his mind to not feel the coal\nShowing figures he's watched enough of the show to give it a shot even though he's not sure how to do it or what might it might have a country it is\nI picked up my mid size rental and headed down the coast along route Ninety five\nIt was a beautiful ride that ended at the orient points ferry across the Long Island sound to the far eastern points of Long Island\nAs we pulled out into the sea I was reminded of how beautiful the east coast truly is and the boats make me sea sick\nI hate boats I get claustrophobic I don't like being trapped we're nowhere to go that's why I don't go on cruises it's like paying someone to put me in a hostage situation [noise] have you ever close your eyes and held onto a railing for dear life and when you came to realize you were hugging a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut\nWhen we finally got to land I found a hotel in Riverhead New York and flipped off the nausea later that night I went to a seafood restaurants and sent an extra three white guys in their seventies who looked like retired\nFishermen they wore faded jeans and washed out T shirts two of them at messy gray hair under tattered baseball caps and the other was his bald as a clam\nSuddenly in the corner of the bar a woman started singing karaoke it seemed weird in a place like this but a crowd quickly gathered around as she built it out me and Bobby McGee the fisherman just scale\nAs she ended a strong applause one of the crusty old fisherman marched up to the microphone as if he was going to pull the plug on the whole affair but then he grabbed the mine closed his eyes pointed at the D. J. and David Bowie is China Girl kicked in\nI was in shock without even looking at the monitor this Ganguly old guy was killing it\nHe at a bar filled with people half his age holding up their cell phones and dancing along I looked over to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wings as if he does this all the time\nHe entered into a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew it his bald friend was up there without taking his hands out of his sweat shirt pocket he bounces round head from side to side stopped and Bon Jovi living on a prayer began\nThe entire bar lost their minds [noise]\nEveryone was screaming the lyrics with fears held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters\nI never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing your phone case with a picture of David Bowie on it the bald guy was shaking hands with strangers as women squeezed them and kissed this had\nHave you ever thought that you're eating in a seafood restaurant in Long Island but it actually discovered the fountain of youth and ended up singing I've got you babe into the eyes of a salty old fisherman [noise]\nAnd I'll definitely be back\nUntil next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nSome [noise] for John Will\nBe performing near here from Livermore performing arts center October twenty fifth graders\nAnd gentlemen please take a moment to join me in a welcoming for the first time as musical director the secret to wizard himself Mr Mike Elizondo no [noise]\nWe're so close to my for his contribution already and we're really lucky to have him with us all season long\nAnd hey works added to announce a brand new segment this season one that runs contrary to my nature is a control freak\nOr calling it three minutes of improv three minutes of improv [noise] we have no idea what's going to have\nBut I Know that it's one of the great pleasures of my life to play music with Mike Elizondo surfer this first in the Late Show of three minutes of improv\nWe're at a time or for three minutes start playing and see what happens\nWish us luck this is a beautiful place right Mike work how does it sound in your heart and had to end ... right now being in this place\nSince this is your first shows ... you're right\nI think you got to take this from Chris I bet you I think you've got to take this one that it's it's just all you\nAlright alright tough tough but fair I'm okay\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThink you know many Troeh\nNew\nNo\nIn trouble\nTrue oh\nI'm not sure how well\nOh\nOh\nOh\nSo\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI don't go after a short intermission you're listening to a law firm here coming to you from Cleveland [noise]\nLive from here supported by progressive insurance offerings told quote explores the shoppers can evaluate options in one place one by one trench coats to grow to ... online learned more progressive dot com\nAnd my beard providing global financial resources in marketing expertise supplies the world over in our WBEZ dot com has more intimate\nAnd by carbonate offering secure data protection solutions for businesses including automatic back up or servers and the best employees protection high ability and disaster recovery solutions an automated data migration we're more carbon I dot com\nBy ... online test prep for the ACT that's designed to improve stores students can get video lessons brush question an expert support on line ... smart so far and enjoy the ride a boost dot com slash ACT\nAnd by pay had nation you can learn to play mandolin guitar little banjo in other acoustic instruments with video courses on ... ... dot com lessons the top I instructors such in Britain the harsh light Compton course instructor and sign up information picket nation dot com slash\nBy Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated in argued over since Nineteen eighty reminding you to think for yourself would drink with other\nIf you have some free time go to our website at like I'm here dot org where your mind all the info about next week's show with the polish leader in Saint Paul Minnesota with our guest dirty projectors and\nYou can also subscribe to a newsletter for updates on the\nCheck out a full season schedule we interviews or former cash\nJobs for the latest lots of humor too much of that video and audio for every show much\nLife from here is produced by American public media\nUse your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty seven gateway drug use the N.
