civilization is when we learn to work together to everyone's benefit\nI Wonder if this work that you're doing here has special residents in part because you are in Gettysburg\nWhich was the scene of so much carnage earlier in our history and does that in a way provided a counterpoint when you when you think about how many lost their lives here in this country was pulled apart and you're thinking well okay what what what do you think\nIt could be I grew up in the south and three of my great uncles fought in the war two of them died\nAnd I wonder when they came on not knowing whether the house but still the one came home not knowing the house was still standing I Wonder if they looked at all that had happened\nAnd I remember that Lincoln had tried to offer an out to free the slaves buying them back one state at a time as was done in many Latin American countries and I thought good grief where we nuts too\nI think that when when we think about the fact that we're meeting at the church called the prince of peace which was billed as a memorial of reconciliation between the north and south after the civil war I think that that says a lot about what our community stands for and work that we're trying to do\nCat does it have some special meaning for you that this work is taking place in Gettysburg I don't know where you were born and raised but does it provided a bit of residence for the work you're trying to accomplish\nI often refer to myself as a rebel in Yankee territory and I say that you know Tony in cheek but uh it it certainly does make a difference and I've said you know enough of in talking was current Dorsey said if we can't talk about civility in Gettysburg and working\nAnd so I happened to carry around oftentimes the civil war ... with me because that reminds me that it wasn't just about political strategies it was about the bullets that tore through the the blood bone and flash of fellow Americans and\nI'm off also not afraid to say and have confirmed as for many people that if we don't focus more on civility in this day in time we're moving closer and closer toward another civil war if we're not careful\nSome of the headlines that we see across the country um and a lot of that depends on whether you focus on the positives of focus on the negatives but there are a lot of really bad stories across the country and that's why it's been encouraging to be\nA part of this group and to kind of resonates the message of civility because it is very very important especially in this day and time we have a chance to make a huge difference and if we don't take that opportunity than we've really missed that\nOne must Chad colleague Darcy Meyer and car Thompson they are members of the politics back and civility we met up with them at prince of
