{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Everyone expects you to appreciate a good life that you have but you still feel complicated times you know not everything is ... those\nThat's Caitlin how she reached out to us for this episode so I called her up to interview her she lives in Eugene Oregon where she works for Holt International children's services which was founded in Nineteen fifty six and it's the same agency that our parents used to adopt her almost Thirty years ago\nI Am a Korean adoptee and I work in the post adoption services department of the agency a it's a brand new position it's really kind of a new innovative direction that we're moving to include adoptees in programming for adoptees\nWhat have you done specifically to\nYou know address these issues that you're talking about these issues that adoptees and brought up to us is feeling isolated feeling like they never had a real chance to get in touch with their birth culture or what have you been doing in your job to make\nThese adoptees feel like they're not isolated and they do have a connection to where they are from\nI think what I've actually seen sharing is that it's not I think that there is this assumption that the longing is for\nBirth culture but a lot of the times it's a longing for like deep connection to people that are like you so I think that that happens in a couple of ways to the work that um I've done\nOne is that we have adopted camps they started out as heritage can set focused on Korean culture but the realization happen that they're adopted from all over the world now in the U.S\nAnd so uh we do something called cabin talk so there's a topic of the day and I remember the first year that I was accounts where we're sitting around and there is domestic adoptees and there was adopted from China Korea\nEthiopia and we're all sitting around and everyone was just sharing their birth story\nAnd for us ... are pretty traumatic stories you know for one girl it's like all I Know about my birthdays I was abandoned in front of a government building in China\nLike that's extremely traumatic if that's your first known existence but what was amazing about ... circle is we went around the circle and everyone shared something pretty similar to that and so in hearing the stories\nThat adopt he knows that she's not alone in that grief\nThese adoptees who I'm assuming are all youth right that are going to just yep okay yeah nine to Seventeen they are just so hungry for a place where there are other kids were the exact situation that they're in and that all almost in in of itself that is their identity which I feel like I don't talk about\nYeah I agree I was actually at a conference it was like the Korean adoptees of Chicago to his annual conference but that was the first time in twenty nine years that I've ever sat in a room of entirely Korean adult adoptees\nAnd it was extremely emotional and I just remember um\nDuring the closing ceremony one of the adult adoptees what's on the stage and they made a remark that you know you guys are my homeland\nAnd I think that that really hit something deep inside of me because it is just like we kind of feel or we can have that feeling like we're not really Korea and for all intents and purposes and we're always recognized as a foreigner in the state so whereas whereas our homeland as adoptees\nAnd for a lot of adult adoptees I think they might not in each other [noise] [noise] [noise]\n...
