I mean there's proof that he's a massage in this but polls say the forty two percent of Brazilian women\nPlan to vote for him how do you account for that\nBecause as human beings they all have the hierarchy of values and at the top of our less than the desire and her survive and when there is an epidemic of crime of the magnitude that has plagued Brazil for the last several years\nJust to give you one quick statistic a person who's a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is more likely to be killed tomorrow than a U.S soldier was at the peak the violence the Iraq War and things like freedom of speech and freedom of press and due process and even respect for women seem to be kind of abstract\nUm when you're having trouble feeding your children are keeping you them and and yourself safe and anyone who promises cheek kind of do that for you and you're going to be someone you're willing to empower\nMost so there's that some of the things that he's he's promised he's also promised to take on the opposition and and he's said some things about the press as well and tomorrow he's expected to be elected president of Brazil so as a journalist who's been critical of both scenario where does that leave you\nWell I don't think anyone really knows I mean he's often depicted wrongly and the western media as being Brazil's Trump and he's actually much closer to say Filipino president\nTo tear day or even the Egyptian dictator general should stay in terms of what he believes in what he's probably keep bowl of carrying out so I think everybody in Brazil who is part of Brazil's political and civic life journalists politicians are ... who have criticized him in the past are all thinking about what it means for them personally\nBut but you're a journalist who's who's written about I'm a I have there been ramifications all ready for you to do for writing critically about a year but Wilson there over the past four years\nWell about four or five months ago he went on to Twitter and used

then as you say he used the slur to describe you in public so you're a gay man who's lived many years in Brazil how do you think about some narrow presidency will affect you\nAll very central prong of his rhetoric for many years in fact the thing that got him attention was not so much massaging or the racism but the homophobia um he most notoriously said only two years ago and asked what he would do if he learned his son was gay he said I Would never let a gay son\nI prefer to hear my son died in a car accident than brought home a boyfriend and\nThere's already been a kind of wave of violence

children who I regard as being the property owners of the future of this country right I'm Sorry not acting our bags and not have been we would do you know easily or readily but I think like most people we know where\nYou're starting to think about contingency plans will begin\n... because the language that that most narrow uses the language of the purge and he said about a ... he's talking about his left wing political opponents here he says either they go overseas or they go to jail that's that's that's something that he said this week so do you think that he can make good on that or do you think he'll try to make good on that\n[noise] I think he will definitely try to make good on that I think the big question is there's really only one faction in Brazil that has the power to stop him the only one that continues to have any\nCredibility your faith on the part of the population and that's the military which I'm the one hand is behind his candidacy in a rather consolidated

so whether they would\nSeek to impose limits on how far and you can do and he's kind of incursions or whether they would be active and eager participants in it as something I don't think anyone knows and that's for sure the big mystery of the big question mark Neumann overall\nWe'll both so narrow is betting that that that people are almost style jak for the military dictatorships in the sixties and seventies it seems that seems to have worked for him politically do you think Brazil's democracy is\n... then then most of us believe there was\nDefinitely and I think you know one of the things that people in the west take for granted because they are democracies are old and therefore their institutions strong but just in the U. S. where\nI Would I Would say the American democracy is more vibrant than ever as a reaction to Donald Trump or there's these established institutions designed to and and are very affected that\nImposing limits on what the authoritarians whereas Brazil's democracy is only thirty three years old and it's institutions now just because of its youth but because of all the crazy though corruption and economic suffering a very fragile\nAnd there are very few institutions capable of functioning properly you let alone and posing meaningful limits and someone who has as much popular support behind\nWhen you look at the problems that that Brazil's faced recently the corruption and the the seemingly hopeless poverty that so many people are mired in should we be surprised that a populist with this kind of uh extreme platform could could could gain a foothold\nAbsolutely not um it it makes perfect sense than if you ever going to have been making about friends in the u._k. and Trump and the U.S and the rise of extremist parties in Western Europe which is that\nYou know if you want you can just call the people who are voting for the movement all kinds of names racist access to eight balls or whatever you want in some cases that might be true\nBut the reality is that when a ruling class fundamentally fails\nTo safeguard the interest of a huge portion of the population sooner or later they're going to realize that and they're going to be supportive of whoever is perceived to be on the outside of that system that they hate and threatening to burn it down and\nI think until we come to grips with that and start engaging in some self critique we're going to have a lot more breakfast you Trump's in Boston ours in our future\nIt's widely believed that ball so narrow will win tomorrow Glenn do you expect the day to be peaceful or do you think there'll be turbulence\n[noise] I think the only way there would be turbulence is that there were a very unexpected result mainly the workers' party winning there has been some slight shift toward the workers' party over the last week it's not impossible but Boston has already said an advanced that he would regard any\nResult other than his and as a byproduct of fraud and the butter the armed forces to take action against it so I Would only expect unrest in ... in the unlikely event that Boston are losing\nGlenn Greenwald thank you very much for being with us\nThink about me appreciate it\nGlenn Greenwald is a cofounder of the intercept and a longtime resident of Brazil [noise]\nWe have to take a short break but coming on eating Robinson is back with a new volume in her trickster trilogy and it's an ... get ready for trickster drift\n\nJohn soliciting lake and it was a young school girl when the Rwandan genocide began it took her parents and hundreds of thousands of other Tutsis or killed by the Hutu majority over one hundred days John survived by hiding in forests and\nBush's while carrying a three year old twin sisters I'm going today John ... an advocate for orphans and human rights here in greater Houston she tells her story in her new book a voice in the darkness and on the next Houston matters Monday if new on news eighty eight seven\nEleven Lacey\nOne elevator before you had to the polls so that makes sense and listened to Canada get there that they think Houston Public media ... pets [noise]\nSupport for use to public media comes from ... makers of men go run ... silver bottle and spice queen look cooler in the gold models available to Houston retailers recipes in more at S.
