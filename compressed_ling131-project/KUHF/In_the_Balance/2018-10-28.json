was going away and even in among full to mountain you would wouldn't be so bad is one of the actual symptoms that was one of the awful kind of paradoxes of depression um but I Do think that that certainly for me it's ... it's made me become far more\nSensitive to other people far more able to listen to other people um I I I'd say far more able to offer support 'em because if you've been for

great to see how the festival has changed in this regard I remember the festival at all when he was in Sunday fourteen someday you had\nAnd people making intensely homophobic statements to audience applause and then you had a number of years led the opening\nThere's quite consciously I think had the panels on Clinton is into these with conflict in working with algae beauty organizations like the

government of some governments put it in Nigeria in which case you might have full and found that just discussing the issue\n[noise] well and then the law actually talks about promotion and operation of gay clubs in societies and I would say that promoting homosexuality as he puts it and any such legislation against that would actually infringe freedom of expression which is guaranteed by the
