Kelly's question is the least we could date\nShe wants to know if there's any way to take the punch after the hurricane\nAnd we're so glad Kelly write to us mainly because I had the once in a lifetime experience flying forty five thousand feet to look a hurricane and it's also because in this program we'll be hearing about some of the incredible ways it may be possible to slow down a stew from the ridiculous let's\nBreak a piece of an iceberg and put it in the Gulf of Mexico or down here in the Caribbean and cool\nThe sea surface temperatures to the downright destructive ... just ...\nThe easier to see on the satellite picture for going over\nBut first back to Kelly in her question the hurricane she's talking about ... swept through the southern United States a year ago causing an estimated one hundred billion dollars of damage in title\nOn the Caribbean islands of Barbuda and on the winds of a hundred and eighty five miles an hour so tens of thousands of people lose their homes\nAnd hurricanes on just a problem here is the U.S prepared for Florence see potentially seen men cooked back to the Philippines forcing more than ten thousand people to evacuate\nBack in ... Florida Kelly tells me hearken wasn't the first stone she survived in fact she's a bit to the veteran\nThey moved to Florida in two thousand and three and in two thousand four there were three hurricanes that year Charlie Francis and Jean Charlie was the one that changed course and didn't have a chance to evacuate yes\nAnd we lived in an apartment on the\nPassed right over us and even though it had been in line for a long time it was still tiny mile an hour winds we went in the master bedroom closet with the cat and we waited it out and\nIt was almost done and power went out\nAnd it was two days as\nAnd wet when Charlie went through it was like it was a bomb that only took out trees there wasn't a\nCanopy a on a gas station that wasn't torn off\nKelly do you have to get used to hurricanes\nYou don't get used to it really but you learn to live with that anxiety nine times out of ten everything's going to be fine but it's that one time that you have to be prepared for and ready to act on\nIf there's one place getting back to being prepared it's Florida\nUm surprisingly for the state's dumped the hurricane capsule of the world there's a little bit of research happening hit into how they work and how to mitigate their effects and as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we could still harkens altogether\nBut before that I Want to start with some basics wants a hurricane and how does it foam why there's so many of them here in the southern tip of the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nBig told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment her for the national university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explained how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans\nTakes its energy from the warm waters with the sushi\nAnd hurricanes work work steam engines the ocean as the board or\nAnd of course wind blowing around in circles turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its huddling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert as tiny disturbances in the flow of whole tab that streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a metaphor but from what the scientists ... true\nMeteorologists always talk about her butterfly flaps its wings on mark and make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car and some other girl butter root for decades\nAnd every one of those could turn into something so you get\nSeventy or eighty or goes during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need room the will to that is a very particular recipe\nNotion surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in the water and that's what the hurricane Webster\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least is on monitoring harkens which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline surely ... is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm fury the purpose of that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening\nThat didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast say ... when that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecasts what kinds of tools to use to track how can\nWe use as I mentioned satellite we use the aircraft to collect data\nOverland we'd we launch radio sons bitter weather balloons\nWe have buoys out in the ocean or we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor
