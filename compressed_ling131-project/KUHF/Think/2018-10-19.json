immediate action to dedicate the needed resources manpower and funding to return tend to air force base to full operations as soon as possible\nSome exterminators really haven't seen very many of them but there is I I went to a new movie in Africa and visited some big macher attorneys mountains which are like a Fifteen foot high mountains that they have there [noise]\nAnd um we're able to pop out the queen and the queen is about the size of my anger\nShe's big wow and the other termites are you know they're really about the size of of the end of my finger nail I mean they're very tiny and very very slight so the difference is just enormous um\nThe queen's are so alter my colonies have some they have babies that are fertile\nAnd those that are not and the the ones that are marked for fertility develop differently they have wings they have eyes and usually on a damn night they'll come out the burst out of the side of the mound and fly a little bit on those wings and then they break them off\nAnd they pair up with some other termite and they go off and try to start a new colony most of them get eaten there apparently really delicious\nBut um [noise] [laughter] that's a side to side [laughter] so um [laughter] they ah [noise] then then\nIn their little hole they um after they've broken off their wings they mate and then they also bite off the end of their antennas which I think it's just amazing because that means that that limits the amount of sensory information that they are getting\nAnd they're going to spend if there are ... are going to spend the next maybe Fifteen or Twenty years holed up in a dark hole\nWith five million of their children [laughter] you know sort of turn down the sensory information and um and the end they bitten off the end of those those antennas [noise] so um\nThen the queen begins to swell as she has more and more eggs she puts out an egg like every three seconds or something like that for years round the clock and she begins to swell so that she really can't move\nAnd should become she looks kinda like um [noise] um I don't know like a really badly tied homemade sausage I mean she's it's really they're really weird looking and you can see through their ... their skin\nOr in their exoskeleton is is translucent so you see this sort of swirling like coffee with cream added to it think actually just looking at a termite queen sort of makes you feel nauseous and weird\nUm [noise] and ah and she is weird [laughter] and and the other thing about turned my queens is it's not just that they have five million or nine million children\nIt's that they can reproduce carcinogenic Lee without without the mail they can produce eggs that don't have holes to get a for the sperm to come in so they can produce eggs that that just developed into new queen termites so they in some ways you know they can live kind of forever\nAnd there are some termite colonies that are headed by two kings so how does that work\n[laughter] don't ask me [laughter] you know there's a\nTremendous variety of ways for termite colonies to work and uh you know you probably heard in the news that there's a new group of or start a new group it's an older group of termites um that have been discovered in\nRediscovered in Japan who don't seem to have an e mails at all um they seem to be entirely um you know an entirely female\nSo um that's something new but there's basically there's often something new under the sun was termites partly because they are just kind of under studied and so much of this study is about how to kill them yeah but I'm the but partly also because they are like\nThey are just crazy sort of genetic adaptive powerhouses like they they've got it figured out they know how to live on earth\nUm and and they know how to survive so uh that's part of what makes them so wonderful to look at it is because they kind of give you a picture of what it takes to survive on this planet\nTermites individual termites get their instructions for what their job will be\n[laughter] [laughter] well that's a several billion dollar question [laughter] um [laughter] we don't know um sometimes\nThey get it from the environment so one of their the instructions that they get is they get pheromones that are emitted by the queen\nUm and those instructions tell them to keep their um development suppress so the workers and the soldiers are actually sort of children or or maybe they're pre teens like they're they're not they don't develop fully [noise] um so they're developments suppressed um some of them will be\nIt seemed to eat special secretion from the butts of the king and the queen and those tend to differentiate into soldiers\nAnd the soldiers have 'em they often have big heads\nA really special big heads or some of them have heads that are shaped like a plug so they can like block anybody who's attacking them from coming in they can just a block the tunnels basically by sticking their headed um but some of them have novels that spray like a turban time like substance\nOn to anybody who's attacking and um some of them lots of them have these wild mandibles that snap and different fabulous ways um\nSo uh that's they differentiate into the soldiers in the soldiers also have to be fed by the workers so\nYou you have to have a pretty big colony to start having soldiers and then we don't know how the workers get their signal some of it they get from saliva from other termites some of it they get from sounds termites seem to communicate through sound a lot they do this clicking sound um they also\nTermites a really sensitive to shift and the gas composition around them so if there's a fresh or if there's a hole somewhere in the mound there's some fresh air coming in they'll run towards that whole they'll run towards the fresh air to try to block it um\nBut uh it's only recently become clear that term ... memories\nHuh well they don't necessarily need a lot of individual memory to get done what they need to get done right\n[noise] well that's a good question I mean when you look at these mountains in that are like Fifteen feet high or or Seventy feet high in Africa [noise] um [noise] it's kind of how could you even think about this but on the uh you know it's hard to come up with a master plan that\nWould result in this mound they're very sophisticated um but then when you look at what they build it out of out of individual mouth full of mud and it it's it's really extraordinary and you do sort of wonder what drives them and and how they conceive of it if if at all\nMy guest is journalist Lisa market Nelly her book is called under bug an obsessive tale of termites and technology will come back to the conversation in a
