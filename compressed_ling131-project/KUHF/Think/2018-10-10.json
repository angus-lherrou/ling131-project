Christopher Wray is defending the bureau's background investigation of new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh rate tells the Senate Homeland Security Committee that the FBI followed its usual processing conducting an investigation\nAs a standard the investigation was very specific and scope limited in scope is the usual process my folks have assured me that the whole process was falls\nFrom the knowledge of how much my my race definitely did seem to matter so when I told him I was being picked on for being adopted that's when the advice came to just ignore it and it would go away\nUm but I wouldn't tell them about the racism that I experienced at school for many years I think probably when I was in my late teens early twenties is when we started talking about that\nYou take pains to note in the books that um the the failure to sort of recognize everything that you were going through was not unique to you're white parents like as you mentioned they had asked for some advice and the choices that they made were like typical of a whole generation\nWhat's interesting is when you talk about them asking for advice it sounds like they didn't seek out an adult to had been a adopted by a couple of another race and ask that person what they might need to know [noise]\nNo they didn't I don't think they knew any adult adoptees adoption certainly been common for a long time and transracial adoptions and Korean adoptions are from Korea were very very common but I don't think they knew anybody or or really close to people they could ask\nA it sounds like a deeply personal question to ask another person so I think even if they'd known adult adoptees of color it would depend on the relationship as to whether or not they set out an ad like let's let's be really real tell me everything he went through and tell me what I should know that's asking a lot of labor of that that person\nUm so yeah I I don't know but there wasn't really you know in my in my small community in Oregon I don't think there were a lot of people that they could have gone to\nSo you've had people ask you use the questions do you notice how hard it is to summarize your entire life for people who were way what do you think they want to hear from you when they ask you that question\nI think some of them want to be reassured that many many truly want real information they really do want to know what my experience was like not because their child will necessarily face the same things I mean\nIt's just my story it's not representative of every adoption or every a Korean adoptee or every trans racial adoptee but with all those disclaimer yeah I think often people are just looking to listen and maybe learned from someone else's experience a little bit um\nMaybe some do really want to be reassured that everything will be okay [noise] um but yeah I I don't know I I really I think it's great when people do seek out and really listen to the stories of adult adoptees\nAnd at the same time I want to be clear like I I don't necessarily think it's always appropriate to go asking people to share those personal details or a stories about their live um but yeah when I get questions I I think people are just genuinely curious most at a time\nWhen did you start to realize there were things you didn't know about your own origin story that you were curious about\nThat was always curious about things we didn't know like simple obvious\nThings like what are their names what other hobbies what do they do for a living I'm a ... you know I had a lot of questions I wondered if I have siblings and if I did what they were like\nUm things like that and I wondered I guess if we had any shared interests right or\nI've always really loved writing and I liked music and I wondered what my birth family musical you know things like that\nUm I always kind of wondered about those things I think not knowing though it was much easier to live with when I was younger um and it really wasn't until I was in my mid to late twenties where it just felt like I I had to try and find answers you know that's where it got to the that's when it got to the point where not knowing became really difficult\n[noise] do you did your parents of any of those same questions they they could have asked more than they did when they adopted you about about your birth family\nThe way I understand it from things they've told me is they didn't want to know too much um it was a closed adoption which was really common standard at the time\nAnd open adoption for a domestic incident placement at that point would have been unusual uh so it was pretty typical and I think they were honestly afraid of the idea of an open adoption just not really sure how it would work\nWould I be confused would they be confused would they have to share a me um I don't know I I really think they just didn't want to know too much at the time and they were also afraid if we ask too many questions you know what if it doesn't go through\n'em so really they they took like what they were given and didn't push for more information\n[noise] this is think I'm Chris Boyd\nOne really unusual part of the story of how you came to be adopted was that um you discovered your birth parents had been married they had a reasonably stable business they they didn't seem like the typical candidates to be placing a child for adoption understood\nIt they were definitely having some financial struggles um you know they they had been trying to establish a family business for a few years but I don't think it was um [noise]\nI I'm not sure I I it's hard for me to get a full picture of the ... of what it was like at the time so maybe stables overstating it but it was they were they were they were married they had other children at home um\nAnd the social worker who handled the adoption in told my adoptive parents she was confused by their decision um and said I told them they didn't have to do this and\nI really feel that um I I Know that they were they were convinced they had to do with that it was the best decision um but yeah it was it was a slightly slightly unusual circumstances I suppose\n... ... and then of course they had other children there's the question um that you were really curious about like what were those children told about why would they be never came up\nI\nAlways assumed for some reason that they would have been told about the adoption\nAnd maybe not right away ah well I didn't know I had siblings to be clear but I figured if I did they wouldn't know the truth at some point maybe not as children but when they got older you know I searched as an adult so by the time that happened they were also adults\nI thought by then they would have been told 'em but as it happened my sister and my sister are both told that I died in the hospital so when I got in touch with my birth family it was a complete shock to them you know as little information that I had they were working with a lot less uh so that was definitely a surprise\nFor me and I remember feeling a little bit guilty to for just sort of intruding in their lives with this huge shock I about something I I guess I had assumed they would at one point have learned um that was that was that was hard yeah they\nThey were happy to get to know you but it was it was a real shock\nYeah discovered exists right you know ... they were both really kind and gracious to me and um but at the same time I I yeah I I wasn't sure what to make of it I really did think that at some point they would have learned the truth\nMy

alien in the family like I was very different not just looks I mean like personality interests I was really musical and my parents can't carry a tune and I\nRemember I pushed myself really hard and I had all this internal pressure and I love to write and these things were just foreign to them like they couldn't understand them\nUm and so when I did reconnect with and start talking with some members of my birth family like a lot of them are were very different people too but like we share this certain intensity and drive I think um my birth father and my sister also right and that was kind of amazing to find out\nUm we share weird little ticks I don't I don't know that it's genetics it doesn't make sense to me but like just weird little takes my sister and my father and I we all have this habit where we like\nRight with our finger on surfaces like or right in the air while we're talking I'm I don't know why I don't see a lot of people doing it but we all ... all three of us do it and then when I met my sister just seen similar expressions on her face like matched mine as different as we are like I think there are a lot of similarities and\nIt it's been really special to see those connections I'm again just not being able to really recognize myself\nAnd anybody else in my family growing up and I I don't just mean like physical similarities I mean personality to um it has been really neat to reconnect and experienced that for the first time um and then I also see it you know because my mother I see it the same connections between me and my children and and that's really wonderful to\nKnow you've written a book about your husband like he couldn't stop taking pictures of you and your sister when you first met because he was seeing similarities and you were like cut it out for it he was really struck by the by by the ways that you were like\nYeah those are husbands were just like it was like ping pong from her to me and back again and they point out every little thing we also confused for one another sometimes like um like from the back of my nieces mistaken me for her mom more than once and\nUh when I read in Portland the other night my sister was there and some of her friends were there and they said to me after seeing you read I saw a lot of expressions that I've seen on Sundays face it was so strange [laughter] so that that was kind of neat for me to hear to\nThis distinct I'm Chris Boyd [noise]\nBefore you were in contact with your birth parents do your birth mother and brother and we should say that they uh they divorced um years after you were born so they're not together but um [noise] was there something that you imagined hearing from them was there one thing you wanted them to say to you\nIt's such a good question I think what I really wanted deep down was for both of them to say that they loved me and that they did not regret I didn't want them to regret it and I didn't want them to feel ashamed at all because I I think I did understand what a difficult situation they were in and I really wanted to honor their decision in a way\nUm I wanted them to feel more at peace and they seem to I I was hoping if we reconnected I could tell them one of these as I wanted to find them was so I could tell them you know thank you you gave me life like I Know it was a hard decision but it turned out okay you know things are hard sometimes but it turned out okay and\nUm I don't know I really wanted to honor their decision and it's not something I think they do feel real piece about I don't think\nI don't think it's something they necessarily think about every day I don't think a ... it's not like they haven't moved on because you have to move on in life but I was hoping maybe caring for me it would give them some sense of peace or if not closure\nResolution and I do feel like I have not been able to give that maybe it's it's taught me a lot about the limits of um\nOf of just being able to provide that for somebody else like we're all on our own journey is and that's not something I can give them as much as I Want to [noise] um I you know I guess one day I Would really like both of them to feel at peace with the decision that they made as hard as it was\nDo you feel like you go to satisfactory answer as to why they made that decision\nI Do I think they were just in a very difficult situation um and it was true that they were\nYou know not completely stable financially they didn't have health insurance the doctors were telling them she's going to have a lot of problems she's going to need around the clock care I think they felt really overwhelmed and we're navigating child welfare and legal system in a second language [noise]\nUm I think and also there were there was real and there was real dysfunction at home they were real problems at home that um\nMade things more complicated so\nIt's hard for me to see I guess of course they could have made another choice you can always make a different choice but I understand like why they felt it was the only decision\n[noise] so your birth father characteristics you as as your birth mother really sort of spearheading that decision and and the one question you could never bring yourself to ask him directly was if he wanted to keep you\nThere are there are only two possible answers to that question I Wonder which is the one you couldn't bear [noise] [noise]\nOh that's interesting well just to be really clear ah the way it's been presented to me by most members of the family is that it probably was his idea the adoption placement uh he did things that\nMy my birth father did things that my birth mother wasn't necessarily um like equipped to care for me especially because I Would have been very vulnerable as a pre me that was um it was sort of\nThe thing I think force behind his suggestion of adoption is that the only option of the best option um I did I still I still uh think about asking him did you want to keep me it's not something I've ever been able to ask a navy in a way I don't want to know the answer\nI think I think one thing finding them and talking with them and writing this book to it's given me the ability to really empathize with them and their situation it's not as simple as did you want a child or didn't you I mean really that's kind of an unfair question for me to ask\nBecause we might all want to provide things to a child and a lot to love the child and find ourselves in circumstances where it's just impossible that there's too much of life and\nThey're too many other crises and there are too many other things you're dealing with\nI really think their situation at the time was so difficult it's probably not as simple as did you want me or didn't want me but of course if I Would ask that the answer and what it is the um I I Would want to hear that they did want to keep me and that you know they were sad to give me up I I think in a way I've gotten that answer I think they were\nSad I think they have expressed\nRegret maybe even more regret than I Would have wanted them to express\nMy guest is Nicole Chong she's editor in chief catapult magazine and author of a new
