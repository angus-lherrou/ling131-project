board member warns\nThere is only the slimmest chance of avoiding unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it\nFor NPR News I'm Larry Miller in London\nPakistan's Supreme Court has heard the final appeal of a Christian Woman who's been sentenced to death for blasphemy NPR's ... reports it emerged as one of the most important cases in years to reach the Supreme Court there\nThe court reserved his judgment on the appeal and didn't say when it would be announced over the years the case against al ... has led to the assassination of two senior officials one of them was noted by his buddy God who is now regarded as a near St by the religious right\nSo according to their records it's almost like it never happened it's like it never happened unless the person comes forward and complains\nUm yeah and and lawyers with the ACLU which is who a son to turn to to get legal help with her case\nUm they suspect that a lot of people that are violated in this way found to be innocent of carrying any contraband or whatever are still intimidated to bring a complaint about what's happened to them\nYeah I mean her lawyer a when he was doing a ... they did end up taking this case to court I'm with the hospital and was CBP and\nAnd and talking to a medical personnel at the hospital the the lawyer who who I'm represented her told me that he got the sense that they had done this before that it was somewhat\nI I don't want to say commonplace for this happened before and that they thought you know we have to do this because this law enforcement\nI have to wonder what this is costing customs and border patrol if most people fill out that form an retroactively give permission because they don't want to have to pay the bill\nYeah I mean it would be good to know I did several um freedom of Information Act request to try to find out even how many of these types of searches that they do\nUm but they came back saying you know we don't have any data on on how many of these searches that come back with no findings that we do\nAnd then they said with actual findings I think it was less and less than twenty of these types of searches in twenty sixteen that was the most recent data that they had for me\n[noise] so the constitution is supposed to protect everyone against unreasonable search and seizure by government agencies what's different about customs and border protection will customs\nAnd border protection is is its own own entity it it has um\nIt has this ability to do um suspicion ... suspicion was searches at at checkpoints and at the border um it can detain you on reasonable suspicion and not probable cause as is the case with um most law enforcement\nI'm so they have a they have a wider latitude when it comes to searching entertaining people than your average law enforcement agency\nSo help me understand the difference in the sort of barrier of reasonable suspicion versus probable cause\nRight ah well probable cause means that the agent has to have facts about you that make it probable that your committee and are committed a violation of immigration law or federal law\nSo it's it's much more than just a hunch there has to be a a series of uh affects that point to guilt\nOr but with reasonable suspicion it can be it's a little less um robust than probable cause\nA it's a little bit more than a hunch or a gut feeling but it's um they you know they have to have some specific facts but it's not um nearly as robust as probable cause is\n[noise] so what is the legal reasoning for allowing customs and border protection sort of float above the laws that restrict virtually every other law enforcement agency in the country\nWell they were given these powers in the late forties after World War two\nAnd I think because I'm customs and border protection is perceived as dealing with the borders protecting protecting the homeland and dealing largely with people who are not us citizens\nThat they were given these sort of sweeping\nPowers to um you know search people without a warrant detain people I'm just based on reasonable suspicion and\nYou're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right for anybody listening Melissa as I might be if I hadn't read your article listening and thinking well that was terrible for Laura ... of all but I don't trust the U.S border by land um there was a surprise coming tell us about CBP has jurisdiction nationwide\nRight well this is this is the thing when when this wide authority was given to them to do the uh warrantless searches and seizures and so forth there were about sixteen hundred um border agents in the country you know we're talking about the mid to late forties Nineteen forties\nThere's now you know twenty thousand agents um there's twenty thousand border patrol agents and there's about twenty three thousand US Customs agents\nSo combined CBP now it's the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country so they have a ... you know quite a lot more reach and a lot more um agents than they've they've ever had so\nAlso in the fifties they were given up two hundred miles from the border as they're sort of zone of authority\nAnd that actually encompasses about two hundred million people that's you know Houston it's Los Angeles a lot of major um metropolitan areas are within that zone of authority\nSo as they've increased in their size so has their expansion within that zone and within the interior of the United states\nIncluding the entire state of Michigan the entire state of Florida because they happen to be a sort of a geographic\nSet up in such a way that they are close to borders throughout the entire territory\nRight it can be a land or coastal border and they consider the great lakes and maritime border so they consider all the Michigan within their zone of authority\nSo what was happening during like the red scare that caused people just think it was a good idea to extend this kind of reach for customs and border patrol which back then were two separate agencies like was there evidence of some sort of communist incursions across the southern border\nWell it's interesting I think a lot of the rhetoric was around communism and around you know this is after World War two and the fear of you know Soviet agents or somebody coming into the United states and you know harming harming citizens but really\nWhat these authorities were used against actually were um mostly I'm Mexican I'm ... settle workers\nAnd uh this is leading up to um operation went back in Nineteen fifty for the year before\nThey expanded um this reasonable distance of a hundred miles from the border\nAllowing agents to go\nInland more to do deportations and so forth and so what they ended up doing was rounding up\nA Mexican agricultural workers sometimes us citizens as well and and deporting them\nMy guess is journalist Melissa that will scare her Harper's article checkpoint nation was reported in

couple of years ago drillers in Kansas pretty much just started showing things that everybody started to see over and a couple you know ten eleven months for once it hits that first year in the second year for ...\nYeah and that's been another interesting trend with border patrol especially along the northern border is in rural communities especially you'll see them they lose the border patrol called in as just a regular they'll respond to nine one one calls for instance\nUm or there'll be called in to translate if if somebody you know there was a case in in the state of Washington where\nA gentleman called in speaking Spanish um because his son was having a mental health um breakdown and breaking windows in their house and so they sent out border patrol because they said they needed them there to to translate\nAnd that ended up um ...\n... he actually one of the a law enforcement people their shot at the the man and border patrol as well and they ended up killing him\n[noise] what is the relationship between local law enforcement agencies and CBP a in places where CBP is also a presence I mean are they did they think of themselves as as collaborators to CBP have the ultimate authority how does that work I think they think\nOf themselves as collaborators and as as responders um when needed I noticed in in Michigan what happens a lot of time there in in traffic stops\nIf the people in the car speak Spanish or they don't speak English very well they'll call border patrol in um so it seems like the traffic police state police work a lot in tandem with border patrol\nUm we've seen that here\nIn Texas as well um where they will follow up on traffic stops um I think we've seen them less as nine one one responders here but that that there have been doing that up and I'm In the northern border\nDoes that come to that create a tacit assumption closer to the northern border that people who speak Spanish but not English might somehow be here illegal or poses illegally or pose a threat to the country\nWell that's the question you know why if you speak Spanish or if you speak you know English with a broken you know accent why should border patrol be called in the first place\nAnd were they able to give you an answer\nOr no I mean that's that's the thing they're they're totally opaque about it I mean there's been lawsuits to to prevent them from you know responding and I don't want to call in from profiling people um and and I think the latter part of the last to bomb the term um\nThey had gotten better about it and more responsive to the community and and not a you know showing up for nine one one calls and so forth but now it's kind of gone back I think to the way that it was before\nA where there's a lot of mixing between the police and and border patrol and that's really been encouraged by the current administration that they that they work in tandem together\nThis just think I'm Chris Boyd my guest this hour as journalists Melissa ... her article in Harper's is called checkpoint nation it was reported in partnership with the investigative fond of the nation Institute also the Texas Observer [noise]\nUm okay so who's the charges overseeing customs and border patrol and making sure that it is I'm serving honorably as an agency and and effectively and and everything else that we want from our law enforcement agencies will\nThere's therein lies the question who who is responsible for oversight um the department of homeland securities off us office of inspector general has some purview over them\nUm but they have been a there's been a lot of scandal there in recent years because they were not following through on investigations into misconduct in fatalities and and so forth\nAnd then CBP has its own internal affairs office which went through some reform but the problem is they have not been able to hire enough internal affairs officers to really\nUm [noise] over see all of\nThe complaints and and misconduct of such a large agency\nSo when you said he hadn't been able to hire them is that because there's there's no will to hire them because there's no money to hire them or because nobody wants to jobs I think\nThere's not enough funding there to hire them and it doesn't seem to be any will I think Congress has always you know and the president are always really focused on you know let's say boots on the ground getting more agents on the ground\nBut there's very little focus on accountability uh what quality of agent you have out there I'm In the force and oversight you you hear them very seldom talk about oversight\nAnd in fact I'm just a few years ago they um they appointed I'm a I'm a a panel\nOf law enforcement experts to sort of look at their um oversight and their internal affairs system and and you know it was a pretty scathing report they said you know there's just no way right now\nI'm under the current circumstances to root out corruption within the agency it could be going on for years we have no idea\nThey're understaffed in their internal affairs department um the training is not there um they they made quite a few recommendations but none of those recommendations have really been followed through other than giving some of the internal we'll give you an internal affairs CBP\nUm investigated Tori I'm powers but then at the same time they've not I'm not hired the number of agents that the committee had recommended that they hire\nSo if I understand you correctly they can make these recommendations but there's no one in charge of a follow through right right [noise] I was really surprised to learn that in some places a customs and border protection officers get cash bonuses for making arrest\nYes yeah that was a finding in in one lawsuit in New York was that they were um getting cash bonuses and vacations and so forth based on their quota of arrest\nAnd for people who say well maybe that means they're doing good work what's the concern about cash bonuses for well it's quantity\nRight it's like it's a dragnet mentality towards policing which always always um falls on the shoulders of people of color I mean there that the first ones that are going to be harassing the first ones that are going to be detained\nMy guest is journalist Melissa that will scare her Harper's article is called checkpoint nation it was a report
