Florida which is right near Tampa I'm his his father was an elementary school music teacher his mother um was a cafeteria cook and had other a jobs\nAnd very entrepreneurial spirit and in practice and loved to be outside and so did so did her for a copy as a child he was always outside and Florida is a remarkable place to be outside because it's so lush and\nUm there are no dinosaurs there but it's just absolutely sick with a ice age creatures an including the mega fauna\nOf of that time and he has had his mother would take him around the neighborhood and they would walk together and ride bikes together and pick things up whatever it was that looked interesting they would pick it up on it might be can say that they would then sell for money um [noise]\nOr just anything interesting they took it home they're ... they're all collectors in some way to ... uh his father build collected opera albums his mother collected beer signs from her native Germany and other things and Eric when he picked up his first shark too which is in Venice, Florida\nWhich is down in the panhandle and calls itself the shark to the capital of the world\nI'm very interesting place a sound as first sharp tooth and it just became fascinated with what creature\nHad produced it and how the creature lived and when the creature lived and then the fact in Venice is just so so uh but there's so many sharp teeth in Venice um hence the festival but uh it was easy to find them and and he got hooked on natural\nHistory just by finding a sharp teeth and wondering about the different species of sharks which then led to collecting shark jaws said that you could compare this species on his his initial interest was both driven I think by um being outdoors connecting to natural history and then wondering about the scientific\nA past of each of these animals so normally we hear a story about a kid like this and we expect him to study marine biology or paleontology or or one of the sciences but that's not the route that Arab for copy one\n[noise] no it's not he ended up going to he collected all through his childhood I mean from the time he was five years old and he's he's never done anything else this is this has been truly his life\nUm he ended up going to the University of Florida on partial scholarship and graduated very high and his ... landed legs high school class a smart guy\nAnd went to the University of Florida on a partial academic scholarship and was a swimmer and went on to swim team for a little while until his studies became challenging and he had to get something out to get a choice between giving up the swimming the swim team um or or the fossils and he chose to give up the swim team and stick with the fossils\nAnd he was studying at Florida engineering which is no small you know it's no small discipline it was it was incredibly hard and\nUm and he and he stuck with that he felt I asked him once why he didn't study paleontology or some discipline related to it geology um\nThose types of ... and while he did take the sciences he didn't pursue that as a discipline he told me because he didn't like the thought\nOf having to how do I say this he he didn't want\nTo be an academic he wanted to be independent he wanted to search for the remains a extinct remains on his own without having to um [noise]\nFollow academic procedures and and to just live in the academic world that he found I Would imagine that he found somewhat stifling he'd always been a pretty independent free spirit and\nAnd I think he also was yeah I think he also thought that there wouldn't be much of an income and it and I'm In academia so he\nDid go ahead and graduate with two degrees or a double degree in engineering but then ah\nPursue fossils fulltime as all he wanted to do so he gets this business going buying selling trading fossils um [noise] it's kind of feast or famine he's got a little family to support and things like that by a lot of expensive stuff and then they hold out until you know the next big payoff [noise]\nRight and that was that's the way a lot of the big dealers I think it's accurate to say that that's a way that a lot of the big dealers live in his feast or famine that's what a Amanda Eric first wife used to tell\nPeople when they would ask about their livelihood she would say you know we [noise] um [noise] do big projects and pay off all our bills and then reinvest and the and the company and then um you know it's tight for a while and then we make another big sale and and we're good to go we pay our people we pay our bills\nOh [noise] we um she's me we um [noise]\nUh by in their case properties they were flipping properties ... she's a designer and she had gotten interested in the idea of flipping old houses and turning them into um
