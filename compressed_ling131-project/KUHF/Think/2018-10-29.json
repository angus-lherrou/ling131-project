this performance sort of also reminds us that and more and more teams are pitching their starters less and then the ones that are converging relievers pitching longer do you think that's the trend will continue in the coming years in the\nPostseason absolutely the Astros\nDid it a year ago when last colors if you remember and um you have to you saw David Price come out of the book then for the red Sox you saw Chris south but it's the game last night your best\nPitchers are your starters and in the postseason or are these guys are going to have three months brass you throw them as long as you can as long as they held they'll take football\nI'm Wondering though if we're starting to see this developing the regular season as well starting pitchers themselves are increasingly being taken out of games after they've been through the lineup twice\nThe stats sort of backup that they tend to pitch less effectively the third time through and I'm Wondering if we're going to see that all become more extreme where maybe we'll have starting pitcher is only going three four innings most of the time\nI don't know three or four I mean but I think what we've seen the last year that will continue ... so that you point out the third time the order the numbers shift\nDramatically against that you're so the hope is you get the guy to five and then you turn it over to your both because that gives you the best odd sometimes I buy too though I mean Richard Hill was dominating had given up one head through thick beginning you know and you give up one run they had a for nothing

otherwise and had the most victories in the American league or sugar and clearly where the ... thing by\nThe ashes are far off I I thought the sort of a better I thought that that sort of a better

I thought maybe I could make it maybe it could be a book um and if it I I Would love to teach writing was sort of the goal [noise]\nUm so I thought maybe within the native writing community that would be my end up reading a certain I certainly didn't I wasn't thinking like one day of this will get you know they still reach whatever I got I was thinking the native world would be interested in what I'm writing about because that's normally how it goes [noise]\nIs there anything you would have done differently had you know that you would have this level of readership and success with your first novel\nI think if somebody would have had a crystal ball and shown me what it would mean or I might hesitate [laughter] as a date to ride it\nHas a yeah I don't know what the exactly means I don't I don't regret writing or it being a book I think um I think it just comes with a lot but I didn't\nRealize would be a part of my life\nLike now you're the like a spokesman for an entire multi million person group of individuals\nYeah and there's so many different um\nThe thing is you know I I'm writing a story from a perspective hair over five hundred and Seventy five um tribes around the country all with very distinct cultures in languages and histories and\nAnd contemporary situations um my biggest hope or about its successes that\nPublishers will pay attention to other native writers and know that our books can do well and people want to hear a our stories I certainly wouldn't want my me to become the new model if you know I certainly don't want to be that\nI'm a I there are so many characters that are really compelling and this I really loved or of all he is a boy who has found himself he has this kind of compulsion\nTo dance um odd to do Palau dancing and um he's found is ... like in his grandmother's closet and tried it on and he's almost like he's afraid she's gonna catch him because he he doesn't quite feel right wearing it\nAnd they were interesting parallels there for maybe you know between um horrible situation of of trying this identity and not being sure about it and and kids who maybe has been afraid that they would be found to be gay or transgender or something that feels like part of them but they're not sure if they can show it to the world\n[noise] um [noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean everyone in this novel has um\nHas a different proximity and to to what being native is or or how they feel about it and his mom [noise] um I mean his grandma um doesn't necessarily want to teach them and also it expresses that um\nDoesn't need to know information or be taught some particular culture for him to be ending and she says in their uranium because you're Indian because you're Indian [noise] um\nBut tradition certainly plays a role in you know everyone's going to a power and um\nI put in powers is sort of a central I'm setting or where everyone is going to end up because I'm I feel powers in urban India Indian experience or have parallels because they're very inter tribal cities tend to be in a tribal um but it's also a place where um\nYou see sort of I I have a line and there were Indians dressed up as Indians um so\nI think there's always going to be a struggle and attention between how to be authentic and what does that look like and how to continue to be contemporary and to adapt to you know modern life and still feel\nIndian because if you need if you needed to be in the past than you know if you're on your way to disappearance yeah like\nLike you're wearing a T shirt in I guess genes or an and that's how you dress and you don't necessarily need to wear something that people would have won a hundred years ago\nYeah and at the same time it's actually an A's shirt and it was designed by native I'm\nA native artist from Oakland and it's you know it's done it was at the Native American heritage night at the Oakland Coliseum or the day actually we got back from uh the tour there is their heritage and it caused him starts up how it answers on the field which was a surreal moment [noise]\nMy guest is novelist Tommy orange his novel is called there there if you would like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think K.

way you form your identity and when you think of yourself in the world so I just wanted to explore the many different um iterations of of that in in in um Oakland native ... um community and what that can look like\nHow did your parents when they were married and I don't need all the details of their divorce I'm not I'm not plumbing for that but how did they talk about the ways that they were different culturally\nSo my mom um met my dad in northern New Mexico in the seventies shoes sort of a wandering hippie and he was um he had gone up to learn 'em\nA ceremony from a guy and I put little guy and ah if this was um this is Native American church which is a parody ceremony\nSo they met in that context and eventually um they lived in Oklahoma for awhile eventually came out to Oakland and by that time my mom had become an evangelical Christian\nAnd my dad had continued to be I'm a Native American church member um and he'd be gone off and on weekends so this was actually a big source of um fights because according to evangelical Christianity um parity used was sort of this demonic thing\nAnd so I was\nConstantly I was aware of this cultural difference there wasn't that there's not that much you know white culture is not necessarily a thing it's sort of the dominant culture or the default maybe um but being shy and are being native is a distinct thing\nUm it's not just a default it's so I was always aware of this inherent conflict and also lots of fighting happened in the house and there was a religious pieces to it and also like you know having a white mother in Indian father\nYou know with what history has been there's been ... conflict there that I just felt was a part of our ... our life our family\nIs just think I'm Chris Boyd did you feel like you had Q. um after they were living apart did you feel like you had to be a different version of yourself depending on who you were saying\nNo no I I never um\nYou know divorce is hard on every kid you know um but that that that wasn't part of it for me I never felt like um it changed me in that way\nSo you mentioned that you work in um mental health at at it is an Indian Health service\nIt's a the Native American health centers in the name of it and\nI'm ... you were collecting stories they're right I mean not maybe deliberately but you were hearing a lot of people's experiences\nYeah and actually did a story telling project there um and I worked for many years as a digital storytelling storytelling facilitator out of a a nonprofit I'm In Berkeley called story center um and you go and teach 'em non writers had to write compelling three minute personal stories and then had a\nUm use digital editing software and they come up with three minute videos that are usually used um usually communities that are under represented and they used these stories to kind of get I'm positive messaging and their their stories out in the world\nThan extraordinary experience for a novelist it was\nUm and uh I I Love\nTo the work I I Wish I could still do it but I'm I'm doing this\n[noise] so ... who is ... grandmother um and is raising him and his two brothers um\nHer mother was adamant that they had to kind of on their stories and tell their stories and open grows up and sort of moves away from that and I feel like you buy very sensitive about her like she's worn out she's got these three kids that are really her her grand nephews that she's taking care of\n... a lot going on and um and it's sort of understandable why maybe she feels like this is not one more thing that she can incorporate into her life but um [noise]\nDid it feel different writing about a character who had moved away from at least an outward expression of her name identity\nI think um\n\nDon't think I knew it at the time but in retrospect I think it was me trying to figure out um why my dad where her dad didn't teach the language I mean what are the complicated reasons why we wouldn't have been you know he was an engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley labs and um\nHe was he worked full time and if you don't have to um language speakers in the house it's a lot of work to you know to try to get all your kid speaking the language [noise] um so I think I wanted to understand better why we didn't have a more um\n[noise] formative cultural education um and I you know I found out I found out over time that it's it's complicated and related to a pain in his own\nIt had growing up in Oklahoma and there was a lot of pain attached to his experience so I I think through mobile I was exploring whether it will how could that how would that ended up happening or why would she have a feeling like she doesn't necessarily want them to\nHave to learn one way to be Indian or let them figure it out um any kind of had that approach you let us all figure it out for ourselves and I'm also you know a lot of\nWhat it means to be shyness is so embedded in his way of being um\nThat he knew it would it would be transmitted without having to do anything how do you think your life would be different if you were fluent in shame\nUm I Can't even imagine you know so much of culture is embedded in language and my sister just became fluent and I'm I'm slowly I'm moving toward trying to understand the language better um but I Can't imagine what it would it would be like to be a totally different person\nYeah especially for someone who who traffics in words and in terms of understanding people through the way that they speaking through writing about them um [noise] is there like is there at a shining phrase that you're aware of that you're like\nThat is something really important Mm I'm\nYou know I'm just starting to get into it and if I'm working on a autobiographical family novel and I'm an ... I Want to shine language to be kind of a character and so I'm ... I'm studying it for those types of things but I I don't put you on the spot [laughter] I don't have one on one hand um\nBut there are things that I'm studying about it already that are super interesting will be in a you know\nMy guess is not less Tommy orange his critically acclaimed debut book is called their their if you'd like to join us you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think K.
