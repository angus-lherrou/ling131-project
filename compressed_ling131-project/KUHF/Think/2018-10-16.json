Steven foul reports it's the latest legal challenge to that state's voting system\nMore than a thousand absentee ballots have been rejected across Georgia so far about a third of them come from a predominantly minority metro Atlanta county libertarian candidate for secretary of state's mice Duval is one of the plaintiffs\nAnd typically when you're writing and do you want that level of intimacy you rely on a first person voice\nBut the challenge was the key characters are Mary in Eaton who is locked in his own body with varying degrees of consciousness and so the two of them are separate from one another so you can't if you narrated for marriage point of view you can have access to eat and vice versa\nSo the level of our missions I Need it lends itself to a third person narrator but then you don't have the intimacy\nAnd so that is where ... best friend comes into it the narrator who has that ... a because he is dead but has the intimacy a of of speaking and the first person\nOne thing the narrator tells us is that um he sort of mired eating at the great pleasure he took in food which is a very it's a fascinating detail to choose because it's the kind of delicate sensibility that may be a lot of people don't associate with for years\n\nAnd that was very much a my intention I'm was you know\nWe have in this country uh you know a an existing and growing civil military divide\nAnd there's Austen assumptions about you know what a marine would be er a soldier would be or people who go off to these wars and I very much and the character want it to show someone who um you know wasn't what you would expect and a boat was in fact\nVery common because I think a lot of those stereotypes don't necessarily hold true so you know eat in is this somewhat larger than life figure who is\n... to ... when before he's entered is two hundred and twenty pounds likes to ... likes to box is very tough and or a boss but also um cooks in his spare time and you know likes to roast duck when his friends come over and has a vast\nAnd very carefully carefully curated collection of wine so um\nAnd that is not an accurate I Know a number of people who've made careers in the military who have all sorts of the classic taste because after all they're they're just people you know everybody else\nAnd it's a cross section of America that it is um another interesting thing about that is that um this is not really an interest that Mary shares and it could just be a minor thing you know couples I have different interests all the time but but here it feels almost like like it represents a kind of existential\nDistance between them [noise]\nSure you know they didn't the novel isn't really a war novel um and listen I get that uh you know people will look at might look in my background and obviously some parts of the book do deal with the war but I say it's not a war novel because I have to be honest when I was sitting there working on it and writing\nYou know I'm pulling a\nAn excavating you know my own emotions on certain issues on my own experiences and when I was excavating we're not really wartime experiences as much as you know my my personal relationships how I feel about marriage show I've have I felt about the issues of fidelity in friendship [noise]\nI'm In to me that's what's really at the center of this book I mean of the war gets eaten in bed and puts the initial tension and to this story but once the story gets going you know it's really about these three people in their in their star crossed lives\n[noise] um the\nThe reason that evening marry are together is a really interesting um ... and and we wonder where they destined to be together or they just did they just find each other and and maybe these are questions that that we ask ourselves in any relationship right like like is this is this supposed to be or is it just is it just two people who found each other\n[noise]\nAbsolutely um and I think you know in in the book or the narrator at one point is saying that uh is describing how if you ask eat in or Mary how they met you wind up getting a different answer depending on which one you asked um jobs I think is pretty common\nUm you know in terms of the stories that we we tell ourselves but uh the one thing there's consensus on and said they sort of ran into each other um but it's not the ideal like they bumped into each other it's the idea that they were both running away from where they were found and found themselves on the run at the same time so they\nSo they wound up both departing in that way based on the circumstances of trying to escape the small town where they grow up\nAnd that leaves them together um and I don't\nKnow necessarily whether or not that means they're love is less or more than anyone else's um I think\nThat the\nEthical law but also low of ... romantic who\nWe identical always sort of love each other in imperfect and broken ways and in so many relationships the core of that love is not that we love someone because of X Y or Z\nBut uh in elections that last it's often because we love despite ... y or Z in the despite is more central than that because\nI'm so before\nEating returns to the war Mary has has begged him to stay she wants to start a family in just\nAnd live the kind of life that she feels like everybody else gets to have um [noise] when you write about them disagreeing over this an arguing you seemed to completely understand how marry feels and you seem to completely understand how eaten feels and I wonder if those were both\nUm equally easy or equally challenging for you to comprehend for yourself and then put down on the page\n[noise]\nUm well thank you I mean that's that's my job is to try to figure out how these characters feel so um if you felt like a prank truthful I appreciate that but um\nI think that when you are working on a story and you're in a novel you're creating characters and your job is not necessarily to like the character or to agree with the character but your job is to make the characters case and the story and when you're having the character you have to\nGive them the space to make their case as though they're making it before God\nUm and if you do that you'll have characters that feel fully formed and round and real to the reader\nMy guess is novelist Elliot Ackerman his new book is called
