T.

T. Andrew gram but when I had it\nAnd when those results came in\nA it really get open my eyes to you know how patients think and feel and how vulnerable they feel about their own hearts huh and I think that was probably the most eye opening thing\nSo people have probably always associated the heart with with this kind of life force right recognize its imports\nFor a beating heart for a person to be alive but um it took a really long time to figure out what the heart actually did can you talk about what the ancient Romans imagine the heart did for us\nYeah I mean\nThere there\nIs some relatively sophisticated scientific thinking I'm In the ancient Egyptians and some schools that suggest the heart does a circulate some sort of life spirit um but the Greeks Romans for the most part really focused on the heart as a century\nUm in other words at a as a warning system or that things might be a mess\nAnd in a sense there is some accuracy there because our hearts do start beating faster when we are I'm In the presence of danger or our autonomic nervous systems do feed into her heart a heartbeat and\nAnd cause I'm you know rapid heartbeat increase blood pressure and and and other things\nSo but the the focus really was on the heart as the seat of the soul and uh the repository of emotions are and it really wasn't until the um the renaissance so maybe two thousand years\nAfter the Romans that we really came to a sense of the heart and what actually did as the circular leader of blood [noise]\nMy guest is Dr Sunday July ... he's a ... a cardiologist and writer and director of the heart failure program at Long Island Jewish medical center of his book is called hearts history will resume that conversation and two minutes and you can join us by calling one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to [noise]\nTo\nA year after Harvey wind scene and me to New York is enacting the country's strictest workplace sexual harassment laws\nThey want to have trading that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protective category not just sexual harassment\nThat story but justice Brett Kavanaugh's first day on the Supreme Court\nIs afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nComing up today is on it for you you\nHave you ever made a difference when someone's life and afterwards he thought I should have done that it's the same with the state landing and you know you want to make a positive impact on society for generations to come\nOf course the key is having all your dunks around to learn more for more information contact Keith development office important need land at seven three seven four three eighty four ten\nOr to get your free planning died looting Houston Public media dot org slash\nDucks Michigan this American Life ...

the heart so if you cut open heart um you would very very quickly succumb to bleeding so so because of\nThose biological obstacles\nThe heart of nip and operate on I also make the argument that they were cultural taboos that probably a slowdown progress the heart after all was the seat of the soul um you know how do you cut into Oregon that's supposed to hold how's your soul\nOr so there were there were a lot of reasons why it took that much longer to operate on the heart and it did any other Oregon and ultimately we know that\nThat the the uh the the way to operate on the heart his through a machine that will take over the circulation so you can stop the heart emptied of blood fix it and then and then re introduced into the into the circulation but\nBut that machine took a really long time to build\nYeah it's it's easy to talk about that in twenty Eighteen but um that the complexities of that challenge are enormous tell us about Walter ... high and how he became obsessed with finding some other way to keep blood circulating during a lengthy heart surgery\nI mean what little high is one of the characters are in the book and\nYou know I I mentioned that one of the reasons why why I wrote the book was because of my family history in one because of the hardest such metaphor eyes or object\nIn human life but also one reason was that the history of heart discoveries so damn fascinating that I I didn't quite realize it\nUntil I um got into the the research but what little high is generally considered the most innovative surge of the ... century he had a crazy idea\nHis idea was basically based on his observation that pregnant women um can a supply you know supply blood oxygen nutrients to they're developing fetus\nSo little high reasoned if I have a child who needs a ... open heart surgery why can't connect that child up to his or her parent\nAs long as the parent has the same blood type connect the they're there to circulatory circuits are ready to arteries and vain and have the parents heart\nTake over the circulation for the child while I stopped the child's heart isolated empty at a blood cut it open so the whole or whatever needs fixing and then\nUh clamp it ... separate the two a parent and child and hope for the best\nUm that was basically using human heart lung machine\nFor a child and you can imagine the uproar um you know in the Nineteen fifties\nOr early Nineteen fifties ... people said this was the first operation human history that had a potentially two hundred percent mortality you could kill to people not just one\nAnd in fact the ... these surgeries he was the only person in the world who is doing open heart surgery I'm In the early Nineteen fifties the only one in the world um\nAnd ah and many people thought he would win the Nobel Prize um he ... he won the American version of the Nobel ... price but um but you know just the the gumption\nTo do something that daring I'm ... ... is it was it was amazing and and the fact is that ... experiment succeeded\nUh the the average mortality for children with congenital heart defects was much higher\nThan it was after a little high did connected them up to their parents and fix their hearts they did in the yang I'm Chris Boyd\nSorry please continue yeah sorry ... in the end a shirt or you know history judges or a little high did was as a success\nUm but that's not that doesn't mean he didn't make mistakes it doesn't mean that people didn't suffer the one I'm very very unfortunate parent a mother to the brain damage because the circuit\nUm to a child was not hooked up properly and bubbles entered into her bloodstream and and and cause severe brain damage\nUm you know ... we we tend to forget\nIn medicine that there was a learning curve\nAnd if we're going to innovate someone has to go first and it's just unfortunate aspect of you know by medical advances um ... the law I hadn't done what he did\nUm those children almost certainly would have died a at very young ages and some of them lived to adulthood some of them live to you know in into the seventies\nUm but there were some mistakes that were made also and I'm In and people suffered a it was a very different time you know the idea of informed consent the way we know it\nWasn't present in the Nineteen fifties in fact when the high performed first car crossed circulation technique this is what he was called what hooking up the parent to child\nUm the the parents signed a weight um he consent uh with that was one sentence long a lead the under signed content on any procedure that ... and his team deem necessary on our child that was the consent\nIt's very different time and um and you know a and a lot of answers were made but you know today
