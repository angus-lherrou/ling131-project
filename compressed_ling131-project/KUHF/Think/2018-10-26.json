early in the campaign we had somebody who gave I think it was a thousand dollars yeah\nThat could lead on or if it's within your means to do so called eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven you can join our studio society as well at Houston Public media dot org\nBegging Martin thank you for joining me all week yeah\nThere sure is that it is yes in more so today than ever before in the Nineteen nineties in in decades past the economy wasn't necessarily viewed through a partisan lens\nBut today it is a we know a large majority of Republicans say the economy is an excellent or or good condition or Democrats or twenty thirty or forty points less likely than Republicans to offer that rosy assessment\nSo it's it's the partisanship that seems to come first of the economy is viewed through a partisan lens today and as I say that that's new it wasn't necessarily the case Twenty years ago\nOne really interesting shift recently has been a number of voters who say Supreme Court appointments are very important factor in their decision making this year\nRepublicans um at least according to conventional wisdom has has been prioritizing this for some time it has not been a major driver for Democrats in the past any sense of what makes this year different\nWell I think that the cabinet nomination an appointment certainly mobilized Parsons on both sides I think many Democrats were were were very uh motivated by that issue in the expressed that to us in our surveys\nOr our survey was conducted in late September so a few weeks have passed you do wonder if that uh the focus on the Supreme Court appointments may waned somewhat with Kevin a bit out of the news as compared with a few weeks ago\nBut it certainly has been one of the top issues or the fall for both Republican and democratic voters\nSome of these questions you had asked a multiple times over the months are you seeing a certain things move in a particular direction well\nWe've seen enthusiasm and interest pick up a little bit throughout the course of the year that's that's fairly typical but again to come back to this main point we're seeing really high engagement in this midterm election are typically in mid term election voter turnout is is relatively low in fact twenty fourteen was one of the lower mid terms of of recent memory\nSome singles point to this perhaps being a higher turnout mid term election as we've seen this enthusiasm engagement tick up\nIs that happening on ... among the voters of both parties\nIt is what's really interesting here is unlike some past midterm years uh it's not that one party is low on enthusiasm and the other is high both parties are pretty high it's just the Democrats or even a touch higher than Republicans Republicans are motivated\nThey're engaged or enthusiastic and many are supportive of of Trump and say their vote is a vote for Trump\nIt's just that when compared with Democrats this year Democrats at the moment seem to have just a bit more enthusiasm\n[noise] um why has the divide over health care grown between Republicans and Democrats [noise]\nWell it's always been a a divisive issue for partisans and I I think as as the policy has evolved in in Obamacare has suffered some setbacks legislatively it's just further reinforce the partisan divide on this issue and you've seen Republicans\nA staunchly against the law of Republicans a staunchly for the law and that that divide has just grown somewhat in in recent years\nThere's certainly a lot of foreign policy news happening I Wonder how engaged voters are right now in foreign policy issues as compared with domestic issues in terms of um things that are motivating them to go\nYet domestic issues seem to take priority at the moment and that's not unusual but issues like health care of the economy and immigration these are top tier front of mine is used for voters and do we are in an act of foreign policy environment those foreign policy issues I tend to be a second tier lower tier for voters\nWhite voters tell you about their views on how much the U.S should be willing to compromise in dealing with foreign allies\nWell it's really interesting because here again you see a partisan response that Democrats say that the United states should uh really consult its allies and see if they disagree strongly on any foreign policy decision\nAnd Republicans take the opposite view and say that the United states should follow its own national interest even if its allies strongly disagree so the public is divided bipartisanship on what the best approaches when dealing with international issues in dealing with its allies\nI was interested to read that just over half of Americans think the U. S. gets taken advantage of by other countries but that percentage is actually weighed down from the late nineties\nThat is in it which is an interesting finding and the reason is way down since the Nineteen Ninety is is that Democrats have fundamentally changed their views of Nineteen in the Nineteen nineties Democrats are a majority Democrats thought that other countries off and took unfair advantage of the United states\nBut today that shares just twenty eight percent and that's the main driver of the top line the overall number is that Democrats no longer believe that other countries take unfair advantage of the U.S they said that they generally treat us has fairly about is fairly as we treat them\nSo Democrats laugh and say the Republicans have gone far to the right Republicans will often say Democrats have gone far to the left is there evidence that voters are in fact moving farther apart from each other toward more extreme positions on both sides\nWell there is evidence that Republicans and Democrats have been moving farther apart from one another and their basic values and beliefs and in some people talk about this and that call this political polarization is part of what we studied in recent years is that it's true that more Democrats hold consistently liberal views on issues in more Republicans now hold consistently conservative views on his shoes\nAnd as a result the gap the overlap between the two parties is less than it was in the past\nAh and that's a new and that's that's that's different from ten or twenty Twenty years ago but it's important to note that both parties have move not just the Republican Party and not just the Democratic party\nA lot of people worry about this polarization is there a reason to believe that it's bad for democracy somehow or is this just an expression of how people feel\nThat's that's really one of the the hot topics\nIn political science in other realms it's not a question that we have an opinion on but it is interesting to note that many years ago and political science people limited the fact that uh the public wasn't more consistent in their views are that why shouldn't we are Democrats take liberal positions in Washington\nRepublicans take more conservative positions that would almost be a sign that they have a have a robust grasp of what their partisanship means now that we're in an environment where that's more and more the case there are many people saying hey wait a minute there are a lot of perhaps negative consequences so it's it's a robust debate but it's\nFrom our point of view it's not normally if we'd good or bad but there certainly is a lot of conversation out there about potential negative impacts\nDo you have a sense from either this research or other polls that you've done as to whether there are a lot of truth swing voters left out there\nIt is true that some relatively small share of all voters are are true independents they don't mean to either party a in they don't affiliate Orleans\nRepublican or Democrat but that's relatively small group of voters so yes of course when swing voters still exist but the vast majority of voters are either a self identified\nPartisans were lean to a partisan group in and behave much like Parsons himself so it it's a really a two part answer of course yes there are swing voters but the vast majority\nOf all Elizabeth voters have some form of a partisan ...\nTyson is a senior researcher with the Pew Research center alec thank you so much for making time for us\nGlad to be here coming up how laws governing elections affect voter turnout and how who votes affects election\nThis was the first presidential election and fifty years without the protection of the voting rights act um because the U.S Supreme Court had got at the voting rights act and the twenty Thirteen Shelby County beholder decision that's after a short break ...\nWider access to quality education technical training and improvements in quality of life will enable Houston\nTo grow its economy Houston Public media's multi platform focused on education TV radio and digital relies on funding from individuals like you have you have the

energy services with over a century of experience and business sooner je ne se including consulting strategy and pricing information at some point energy dot com slash energy services it's one twenty three\nFunding for thing comes from DC you wear a horn for all strive to be ethical leaders and global citizen like Dr Jonathan Oliver researching solutions to help reduce concussion damage among athletes more I lead on dot TCU dot edu TCU lead on\nIn Alabama for instance after they said no public housing id then governor Bentley shut down the department of motor vehicles in the black belt counties wow and it took a lot of pressure\nTo get them to open them but the way that they open them is that one county would have a DMV open for one day a month another would have one open for two days a month\nOr so that's not readily accessible uh so it's this kind of of of documentation issue as well as distance issue that leads to the disparate impact of this kind of voter id law some\nJurisdictions around the country are a limiting the number of days of early voting the number of hours that people can vote why does that have a disproportionate effect on voters of color\nAnd so what that does is again because income and race are linked in the United states\nAnd so when we have voting that's on a Tuesday in November that's generally a work day so just take it ...\nIt is hard to get through the traffic here in Atlanta in order to get to work on time so you can punch that clock at eight o'clock when the polls open at seven so you can punch that clock at eight o'clock so that you're not losing pay or having to take some time off\nIn order to vote and so what early voting does is it expands the voting period\nSo that people do not have to choose between losing pay or losing the opportunity to choose who's going to be making the policies that affect their lives so let's take a North Carolina for instance what North Carolina did\nIs that they asked immediately when the legislature was seated they asked for data by race on voting they saw the days that African Americans voted early disproportionately so\nAnd they cut those days how paid off I guess they also recognize that\nIf what you can do is to make the lines intolerable not only would it demoralized people who are standing in line\nBut the research is clear is that that word about these long long long lines then spread throughout the community so what they did in Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is in Charlotte has Fifteen Percent of the state's black population\nThey cut the number of early voting sites from twenty two\nTwenty two to four ... thank Chris Boyd even though we're living through the most contentious\nPolitical year in recent memory there is so much more for us to talk about
