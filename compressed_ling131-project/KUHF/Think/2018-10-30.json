during the Cold War tend to be far more socially conservative\nYes so very key thing about Facebook is um is the word engagement and engagement is is key and what it really means is basically engaging users so that they spend more time on Facebook\nSo essentially they can feed you more content and feed you more ads and the idea is um you know the more time on site which is how they measure engagement in some ways is the most important metric for the company or had been in its in its early years\nAnd so they needed to develop products that kept people there and kept people scrolling and clicking and like in and sharing and comment and and so there was this invention and um [noise] I think it was in two thousand seven of the news feed\nAnd news feed is essentially your\nAs one person in the film puts it your optimize view of the world it's your your personal New York times the New York times of you essentially where the computer algorithm is taking all the information that's on Facebook that friends are sharing that news organizations are sharing that others are sharing\nAnd feeding you what it thinks you want based on what you've clicked on for\nThings that you liked things that you haven't liked things that you shared\n[noise] what is the downside of any of us getting only information that we find appealing\nWell it's a it's a very important question when it comes to Facebook um\nBecause it can certainly flatter your world view and one person put it to me it can it can create what are called filter bubbles or preference bubbles I'm wary if this is your primary source of news and information which it is for lots of Americans and certainly internationally for lots of people\nThen I'm you're getting things that essentially um are not necessarily contradicting your world view because the algorithm is giving you things that it thinks you're most likely to engage with\nI mean the company disagrees with that point they've they've they've they cite research on occasion that says that they're not creating filter bubbles but\nWe heard from too many people but it worked inside the company that that that really it is what I mean in essence the news feed is a filter bubble its its filtering information for you designed for you and I think\nThat the societal effects of it have been quite remarkable um in that you\nAre you're flattering your world view and operating in these bubbles are echo chambers can lead to your kind of closing off from alternative opinions um and also starting to believe things inside that echo chamber that might not necessarily be true\nSo it's one thing to create those personalize feeds based on um things that we have posted on our own pages or things that we have click through and then in two thousand nine somebody came up with the like button which was like the mother of all I'm Dale resources for Facebook\nYes it was a I mean it it's an ingenious invention like button right I mean what it did um is it it was a an engagement gold mine for them because it's an easy way to get people to engage with content um and\nSo it's also a terrific way to understand people's preferences are predilection or what they like and so they're constantly gathering more information about you as the user in order to give you more of what you like and also to tailor advertising which is how they make their money I'm Taylor advertising or target you with advertising that might interest you\nAnd so it's it's also just to you know just psychologically a fascinating thing with the like button and has done and did do and how they thought about it in terms of you know the validation when you post something than if you get validation if you get likes and you're going to post war and you're going to spend more time on site\nAnd now with Instagram which is also owned by Facebook um it's really a lake machine I mean you're you're ... you're not even necessarily reading anything you're just looking at people's pictures and you're like in um\n[noise] what sort of rules did Facebook established for content that wouldn't be allowed I mean to my knowledge you can't get like pornography um what else is not allowed\nRight pornography nudity um incitement to violence which is considered hate speech\nUm but very early on the ... we we we feature an interview with a guy named Tim ...\nWho was a public policy director in Facebook's early years when they essentially we're coming up with what they consider to be the constitution for this burgeoning digital nation states\nAnd they needed to come up with the basic rules of the road for what was acceptable intolerable inside that space of Facebook and what wasn't and\nAs he put it that they took a very libertarian hands off approach because they considered it at the time and it's actually true to be the largest experiment in free speech and human history [noise] um and\nThe it was a it was a very thoughtful and considered approach of taking that libertarian approach because these were truly advocate for\nFree speech and First Amendment rights and um that's obviously a very powerful thing and tool all around the world and places where there aren't First Amendment rights so they felt like\nThey want it to enable people to say things all the way up to a line of incitement to violence and hate speech um and then ban certain things for you know kind of community\nAnd it's like um you know a really illicit activity or ... and things like that um the thing is is that they didn't\nNecessarily or what they didn't have the resources to basically police um the site and deal with all the complaints that came in and\nObviously in some ways that that experiment has gone awry because what do you do about the ability of rumors to spread misinformation to spread or bad actors that intentionally or spreading disinformation and these are things that actually started to pop up early on in the company's history\nBut because of that libertarian approach um they didn't really address those issues proactively\nYeah they were sort of relying on what they called that the basic decency of most people and and I think that's true but we're about to take a break here but when we come back we'll talk about the fact that he really only takes a very small number of bad actors to get a great deal of bad information out on the site\nYes um that that's absolutely true and I think I'm there is a logic though to what they wanted to do and not opposed to many rules um the thing is that they what they're doing now to amp up safety and security in moderation of content is something they um they probably should have done much earlier\nI guess as frontline correspondent James Jacoby he directed and reported the tonight special

Kay um there's other sites that they were using they were creating Twitter accounts as well but Facebook was certainly one of them and they basically cede\nThe social media sites with with pro Russian propaganda and they also be much more proactive\nIn terms of trying to undermine other places like the neighboring Ukraine um which they were already involved in what was has been called a hybrid war you know both troops on the ground and as well as\nOne of the most sophisticated information war is ever fought in which they were basically setting up these fake accounts and disseminating all all sorts of fake stories in Ukraine about ah in order to sow distrust and toward the new Ukrainian government there and pro Russian sentiment\nThis this thing I'm Chris Boyd did Facebook make any changes to its business model when he realized what the Internet research agency and and presumably other organizations were doing\n[noise] no they didn't um they they actually didn't see that as a threat um in part I I I you know I've gleaned from a lot of interviews that\nThere wasn't that much attention paid to how the platform was being used abroad especially in places like Ukraine which is a small market and otherwise that kind of back water to\nThe executives in in Menlo Park the real growth and dollars come from the United states and from Western Europe so if there was something like that going on in Ukraine\nThey didn't see it as a security threat either\nUm because this was just content and given what we're talking about earlier in terms of being a free speech platform people are free to post what they want\n'em and they were warned about this uh according to a very senior advisor to the Ukrainian President um who also happened to have been a senior executive at Microsoft in Ukraine\nAnd um and they saw it as a free speech issue they really didn't see it as a a threat to security\nSo in part two of the doc which airs tonight on PBS stations um you drill down to the real history of\nFake news not in the sense that President Trump tends to define the term but [noise] um can you talk about how a small town in Macedonia became like the world capital of fake news initially generated simply for profit right\nYes correct um so so fake news actually was a is is was coined the term um by Craig Silverman who is a writer for and reporter for ... feed 'em and he\nHe and back in twenty fourteen actually as part of a project at the Columbia Journalism school had been studying rumors and lives on social media and how they go viral\nAnd she started to coin some of these some of these articles that we're going viral the times early twenty fourteen of fake news they were simply written in the journalistic style um to look like", "show_name": "Think", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "30"}
