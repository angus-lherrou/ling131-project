court from nowhere and and I mean it that the truth is he's a he's a kid\nWho got ... who like the rockets just messed with until he snapped but that he probably deserves seven or eight games for game seems a little on the low side for that guy\nFor the fight aside would we learn about the rockets based on their first three regular season games last week\nSo we learned they have a ways to go in terms of their chemistry there clearly trying to figure things out on the fly they haven't really kind of gotten it altogether especially on defense their interior defense is the worst in the NBA right now\nWe also learned at an NBA in general that this is going to be a different year there are a couple of weeks they made the rules there is already three teams that are allowing a hundred and twenty points per game there's been a couple of teams have scored like a hundred and forty\nThis is a the the two weeks they made I think to the rules especially the uh not aligned players to uh not blocking players passage through an audience and then there's resetting of the shock locked only fourteen seconds on and off into ... that is really revved up the office now on the rock inside their interior defense is so bad\nThat it's like a lead thrill out there for what it's been\nThe perimeter defense has been okay the question is can they just sort of figure out the switching defense they've played six guys who didn't play here last year already in the first three games so it's going to be a work in progress them I think they'll get it together but I think what the more interesting is the bigger picture is this really going to be how the NBA's played are we going to have\nRoutinely a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty point games from teams\nJeff all he writes

In Texas between Nineteen ten in Nineteen twenty\n[noise] yeah well there had been a longer history of anti American Violence in Texas so what we understand is that the decade between Nineteen ten in Nineteen twenty really saw peak in anti Mexican violence\nUm so there have been a long interest uh and use of mob violence and violence at the hands of the state police to correct any sort of um efforts by Mexicans living in Texas a that we're trying to to to to challenge Anglo colonization of the region\nUm but that didn't also mean that Texas Rangers weren't combating Anglo ranchers for example of that we're not supportive of the barbed wire that was being used to\nPolice to defense and private property so these conflicts between\nUh ethnic Mexicans in that erupted in the early twentieth century has longer deeper roots\nUm but when you had a large numbers of Anglo migrants from southern states in order to states moving to south Texas and the early twentieth century they were calling for things like more border security so in that era\nYou had people who lived in towns like Brownsville a that bordered models and they were connected really communities not just economically but also socially and culturally and so people lived fluidly into borderlands\nAnd one of the efforts of these English settlers that came to south Texas was to make the border between the United states and Mexico feel more like border\nAnd so they called for things like more border security and the militarization of the border and when the Mexican revolution\nOr the the conflicts of that civil war arrived in the northern border with Mexico in the United states of those calls for border security were amplified and eventually they were answered by the United states government and in the form of hundreds of\nA hundred thousand us troops that were stationed in on the U.S Mexico border and a large number of them in Texas\n[noise] worst fears that angle Texans had 'em that they might suffer the effects of some kind of spillover violence justified I there are stories aren't there like contributions guys coming across the border did this happen in Texas on a regular basis\nThey did happen in Texas do their part of a one of the the to the complications of understanding this period\nUm is that there was a a an effort by some in South Texas to uh what's known as a revolution the the blonde to San Diego I'm which erupted in Nineteen Fifteen and so to summer of Nineteen fifty was particularly brutal\nUm you did see raids taking place up he did the Mexican revolutionaries you know crossing into the United states uh for reprieve and so you'll Bon Jovi I is this\nMythical figure I'm In part because he also played out his role he posed for Hollywood cameras um and uh on display of I've seen his saddles you know to catch the light of Hollywood film a with silver threat and and uh\nA silver horn you know settled horns I'm sure there certainly is uh in in popular memory the the the figure of Bon Jovi I and others that crossed into Texas or that crossed into New Mexico Arizona\nI'm a is it something that most Americans have a a a some sense of of memory of\nUm [noise] but in Nineteen Fifteen with the blonde the San Diego there was really a there were there were efforts to undermine the infrastructure of this in farm colonization so\nThere you know railroads were were blown up and real return our phone up and say you saw these efforts to try to to dismantle\nUm these these icons of Anglo colonization um but what really took place was that you know in the case where you know there was a raid on an Anglo ranch a or a U.S ...\nYou're a died the kinds of violence that were called for were expansive into it was really an era of both of the hands of us soldiers but also Texas Rangers in England inch land is that you had a calls for revenge by proxy\nSo the victims of any sort of raid a we're not just the the targets of the rate of of of in some cases Mexican ranchers but also Anglo ranchers a but anybody in the region who looked method Mexican in this period was profiled as being a potential revolutionary or potential banned it\nAnd so the some of these raids that took place what that led to was justification for the calls for more brutal policing and the more military presence on the border\n[noise] All right I'm let's talk about some of these incidents um what happened to Antonina Rodrigues in Rock Springs Texas\nSo the story of Antonio nobody is is is one that's been widely remembered in Texas and it's the case of a Mexican national who was\nBy some accounts just passing through the town of Rock Springs and Edward county in central Texas um by other accounts he was a laborer who was living in Edwards county I'm In working on ranches but the\nWhat took place in November third Nineteen ten is that he was taken by a mob and accused of murdering I'm an Anglo ranch wife F. E. Henderson um and\nHe was arrested placed in the county jail um and later a move by a mock up at that took him from the jail denied him due process and instead burn him alive at the stake so this is the case that\nIn terms of our understanding of the history of lynchings in the United states I'm really resonates with what people understand as a as a public lynching yeah somebody being taken from police a police can a custody and burned alive in front of a mob you know a a crowd\nUm and so the brutality of being burned alive at the state left a lasting imprint on the community um but it also\nShed light on much longer history of lynchings of ethnic Mexican so ... you know recent historical studies have shown that between Eighteen forty in Nineteen twenty eight over two hundred ethnic Mexicans were lynched I'm In Texas alone\nSo the the the lynching if I don't even know that he gets his looms large in public memory um but it's just one example of the kind of brutality that at the Mexican suffered\nMy guess is ... she is Stanley Jake Bernstein assistant professor of American studies an ethnic studies at Brown university and she has a new book out it's called the injustice never leads to anti Mexican violence in tax if\nYou'd like to be part of the conversation you can call into one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think at K.

I'm One of the things that really troubled her\nAs she learned a family history it was when she realized that there was no investigation into their into the double murder but also that she couldn't find historical documents\nThat gave her access to what happened and so for her it was a sort of let her on a quest uh she knew that the two men a live she had had seen photographs of them are she knew her grandmother Antonia\n... and so she um she could put together a a history of the men who they were um and the families that were interrupted by their double murder\n'em and so she she put together a family archive that gave give us access to who these people were um but but what stands in contrast to that is that the state uh and the judicial system didn't give us access to their deaths\nAnd so um you know that the work of the historians and and for a long time just Texas residents who've had to learn how to conduct history to try to piece together accounts of what took place and of course there are so many unanswered questions for\nThe descendants um in one that stands out for me is that none of my ...\nYou know she she wonders if they suffered after they died and that is a reminder of the loss of life\nAnd the ways that the generations have been deeply impacted 'em by the justification of this pilots by the criminalization of of people who died\nUm and and so there's an injustice not just in an end to violence that took place but also the injustice of the ways in which these killings has been remembered um and presented to the public as progress\nAnd that is um it's another injury they think\nI'm Chris Boyd even though we're living through the most contentious political year in recent memory there is so much more for us to talk about I think we invite you to
