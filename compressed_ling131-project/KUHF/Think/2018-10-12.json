reports from Panama City and tells NPR here and now\nThere are many downed power lines homes split by fallen trees and some looked as though the wind just shared the face off of buildings\nI think the concern here is sort of long term can people live there I mean there's no power and it seems like not really any great chance of power being restored in the near term I mean I think we're looking at weeks if not months given sort of the scale of damage that I'm hearing about\nMental powers are stored there's also no water throughout the city there's no cell phone service in general communication is still just like a huge challenge\nHundreds of thousands are also without power in parts of North Carolina\nMeanwhile in Virginia due to flash flooding and several suspected tornadoes from hurricane

turkey convicted Brunson on terror related charges and issued a sentence of more than three years in prison but the judge is also ruled that because of time already served Brits and should not have to serve the rest of that sentence and they lifted restrictions on his movement clearing the way for him to be returned to the U.S [noise]\nRented was arrested and late twenties sixteen as part of a massive roundup of suspects\nUm and and that's that's the kind of the moment that we're living in a and it's it's pretty it's pretty scary you know because it's not just an issue of\nA personal happiness it's not just an issue of I'm trying to figure out how to feel good it's also an issue of not you know not wanting to let go of ... you know making sure that other people have the same opportunities to feel good that that you that you have [noise]\nI think a lot about you know when when you write about our our sense that the only right way to view the world is kind of through these rose colored glasses we for example have the gall to tell people who are very ill that somehow a positive attitude might make them better and like the flip side of that is that\nIf we're not well if our lives aren't going well it's only ourselves that we have to blame\nYeah um it's it's interesting to think about um how much we're held accountable for um things that are beyond our control yeah um\nThe way that we tell stories about people who are sick\nUm even in our own lives um\nWe I mean a lot of people have a tendency to look for the cause immediately so I mean okay so part of part of our culture that's kind of interesting to me is we are fed this illusion of control right I mean capitalism and the way that things are marketed to us at this exact moment in time\nWe're kind of given the impression that we can control the outcome of our lives right so there's always a path to more happiness or a ... you know to smart proceeds happiness or a path to an exit out a feeling bad\nI'm an exit out of feeling jittery or you know and and by bad basically you mean every that feeling anything right now because I'm to feel things is it in and of itself kind of a moral failure unless you're feeling elation which\nUm how many people feel that for how many minutes of the day it's pretty rarified thing to to strive for\n'em every other thing you can feel it sort of treat it as something that's out of control that's not you know it's not a good feeling um and so you're supposed to fix these things on your basically we\nBecause every aspect of our lives is marketed at you know we're more we are we're told there's a better way to do each thing um that we might be doing not quite in the right way\nUm because we have this notion that we should be living our best lives which sounds to me it's just like optimizing every level of your existence I'm as a result of that but we also feel like we have control over things that are actually out of our control like sickness\nI'm a disastrous outcomes you know I'm impoverish meant um poverty um\nSo so death so um so so as a as a result of that when we meet someone who's sick we we tend to say things like\nOh God did you ever smoke or you know\nA while or is this did they say it was a weight related um\nWhat did they think you ingested that made you you know sick or what what were you exposed to as a kid um and you know this puts the it places the onus of responsibility on the individual like if you were smarter you wouldn't have landed here\nUm and it also treats the kind of ... ... everything as having a church you know if you didn't find a cure you didn't\nBattle hard enough against the you know has menace and are you know I like I mean I you know it's the sort of sounds that we\nReceive kind of echo through my head but just to the statement you know I like people who don't get captured you know kind of sums it up free and I you know not to politicize all of it because there are many layers to and it's not all political\nUm but it's sort of like if you embrace this idea that I'm only week people are are capable of sort of being destroyed or or having misfortune um that puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us you know on everyone essentially\nI'm not to you know find themselves down the wrong path and it's it's ... and not to even experienced the wrong thing kind of you know yeah\nI mean it is magical thinking to to to assume that we can make all the right choices right like if I buy twenty spin class as this month and a ten than than I Will never die we we all know that's not true but for ... for twenty spin classes I Can't believe it's true\nYeah and I mean it's nice to live in that fantasy it's\nIt's tempting and almost ... you know and I'm I'm not at all I'm immune to any of the fantasies that are put in front of my face you know I'm not living in a\nIn a year [laughter] running my own you know raising goats\nUm sometimes I Would like to be a see that's a fan of the reds yeah it is it is it's like you know the fantasy of the year and the goats is like the ... the goats or a gorgeous adorable goats that have been you know filtered through the right filters on Instagram and they don't\nThey don't eat your you know your books or um you know\nAh do their business all over the place and leave ... in your face I mean you know there's not we don't really see 'em\nFlaws and fills in our mediated experience and and part of the challenge of just living a life is grappling with um the fact that you know feeling not so good and having a headache and having being sick at times and having windows that are\nCleaned every few minutes like at a at a luxury hotel you know these things\nStart to kind of press on your experience and make you feel like you're not only that your God my I'm really not living my life um but also they make you feel like it's your you know you're you you're a failure like I you know I can actually walk by dirty window now in my house and say\nIt should be that way I have dogs which took a completely retraining of my mind set\n'em but when I first had kids and I already had dogs before I had kids um I used to just sit in my house and think\nI I Am living the American dream I had everything I've ever wanted and everything looks wrong it doesn't look the way I wanted it to look it doesn't feel the way I Want it to feel um I mean and it it didn't feel like anything because I was too focused on outlook does too focused on my own failures within that picture\nUm so yeah there it it kind of there there has to be a point and I and I you know because I'm an advice columnist I write a a vast probably calling for the cut which is owned by a New York magazine I see a lot of this and other people\nHeather ... is with us her new book of essays is called what if this were enough if you want to be part of our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think at

to the art of conversation about the art engagement with the understanding that your response to art is valid all of those things come through arts education and it's critical was it the way in which our minds can\nBe most open to that which is good and humanity you never know what child is watching something\nAnd a binding their dream finding their passion\nYou make it all possible like your

think I realized in writing this that compassionate the value of mine and so how can I strengthen that value and sometimes that does boil down to things you know things as small as like\nThis you know items to me links me to the love I feel for my daughter or links me to a compassion I feel for animals\nI'm so these little tiny artifacts of our culture and these little tiny ways of moving to the world are actually kind of crucially important to our the big picture of how we behave and treat other people you write really beautifully about um\nThe thing you kept after your dad died was his old wallet\nYeah yeah his um he has he kept all of his um all of his old driver's licenses you know box um [noise] and then he also had is I think he kept his wallet on top of the box and\nUm and it had it still has you know I still have the money that he had the cash you had in his wallet um\nWhen he died and the um the driver's license that he his last driver's license um but you know looking at those looking at those pictures you know that\nThat I mean and their driver's license picture so they're kind of interesting there's sort of um unplanned and\nThey're almost like the purest reflection of where the personal will really was that day because nothing is more you know excruciating than going to the DMV to get your picture [laughter] knowing it'll be terrible and you'll look like a you know it'll look like a mug shot um\nBut but just looking at those pictures of him over the years you know it's such a condensed um unguarded step shot 'em and it reminds me that um\nYou know it feels like a precious linked to him but it also reminds me that um you know time passes quickly I mean ... ... one of the ironies of\nLearning to live in the present is also sort of learning to lead in reality and I think that letting in the reality that you don't have all the time in the world I'm kind of allows you to slow down time because you when you when you realize that you know\nYou will also be dead one day and you know time passes quickly and you're getting older\nUm it really forces you to ground yourself in the moment and I think rounding yourself slows things down a little if that makes sense it's it's sort of like um you feel when you really are in touch with reality instead of looking for an escape or distraction\nUm everything kind of slows down and you think I have today and I can make today go more I you know it's like my my goal is just to make everything go more slowly just really appreciate each day um because nothing is worse than the feeling that your life is just passing you by and I think that our current\nOr current culture is very I'm very very very much a a culture of panic um and and and a culture where in which you just feel like the years or or\nOr swimming by your face you know there's just too much frenetic distraction in our lives this think\nI'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right let's go to the phones now we have a listener on the line in Galveston Hi listen how hard that very well thanks um\nSo I Would say it's really a touched by this discussion I think it's a really important I'm being a young professional and I'm actually a physician that were just\nA constantly surrounded professionally with this ah ideal of perfectionism and it's hard not to let that fill out a into your life [laughter] yeah and there are a lot of my uh my female friends have I've had conversations about the\nAh with me over the years and um [noise] one of the thing that um\n[noise] I really found to be helpful and life giving was ah actually I'm\nA research on them based in psychology um by professor of Chicago I'm Dr Sally swear canning and she studied young physicians and said how can we uh be young physicians and stressful situations arrive\n'em and knowing that either I think very much um but one of the things that she describes that was really a beautiful\nUh seeing like less like a pie chart and more like a piece of music\nUm with the idea that maybe right now I'm really focus on my career\nUm but in five years I'm going to go back in and spend more time a focus a on the art that that brought me a lot of joy or maybe in this season you know most of my energy is going to be focused on my young kids um but in the next the then I'm then I'm going to focus more on cooking\nAnd that to me just like give me a big deep breath of fresh air and says I don't have to do it All right now I have a long life ahead of me\n[laughter] I Love that illicit thank you for calling us or anything you want to respond to either\nI I Love that too it's so great and you know it made me think also that um well I mean first of all it's it's amazing to think about 'em but you know\nI really write a a lot in my book about not trying to do everything um and it's amazing to think about how\nUm I think that a a big a big big change for me was looking at my life and saying which they do I actually not have to do huh hum and one of those things was I'm not going to live in a hotel I have a friend whose house is it's a luxury hotel\nIt's clean clean clean clean\nEverything as spotless and its ... she knows that the value of hers and I salute that\nUm but she has a house cleaning that comes twice a week also [laughter]\nI feel is that if we can afford it [laughter] yeah I salute that too yeah or if if it's affordable yeah um but I think I realized at some point that I Can't\nI needed to trade one thing for another you know I Can't clean my house um twice a week and it's okay um my house is going to have dog hair in it because I have two dogs um and that's\nYou know I'm tolerant of it um I clean it when I have guests over and I obviously I clean regularly also but\nI think that\nThe piece of music thing um I don't really think that it's good to do what you really know is your top priority and that you love it's good to do it now I mean I you know there are things that I think I've put off\nFor years and years and years and I think that um I you know part of that perfectionist urge um that she just mentioned um it extends to um how we spend our time and sometimes it's good to just play the guitar for five minutes you know exercise for ten minutes\nWe think we have to do it all the way but we don't you know we don't have to do that we don't have to be extreme of adult things we do my guest is writer
