T. Q. community and historically disadvantaged groups but yet I didn't have a language for articulating what I was and that's a first generation college student from a low income household\nA who was white and no doubt doubt benefited from that in ways that I might never know but all the same I I did have a particular struggle that I'm kind of went unseen on campus and that was a that was a painful struggle sometimes\nDid you have to learn to Code Switch between I'm sort of the the way that your family communicated and the way that maybe the upper middle class students that you met at the University of Kansas communicate [noise]\nYes absolutely and I'm you know I ... I think that we we don't often use that fairly I think contemporary term Code Switch in the context of class but but that is what certainly the case in ... and still is for me I sometimes say I speak two versions of English country and fancy\nAnd I and I learned fancy in school and some in their ... spaces where that is the only language I bring forth\nBut um but yeah it is a different a different way of communicating a different way of using English neither better nor worse but um or just the the touchstones of of the culture are are different per class in place and\nAh and yeah I I at heck I'm Still I'm thirty eight and I'm Still kind of learning the ways that are not kind of like native to my behavior and my surroundings and uh when I'm In a very rarified place with\nYou know decent people just like they are anywhere but there are different customs and expectations and in different environments that has everything to do with class for sure\nI at least as far back as Charles Dickens we have had really sensitive narratives about um uh you know the humanity of people who happen to be poor and about the hard work they put in and how the system can be stacked against them was England it happens in the United states as well [noise] why is there shame attached to poverty\n[noise] oh my gosh you know my best stab but that is that we has [noise] you know well first of all we have that kind of um a\nNational story or or perhaps missed that you're talking about at the outset the American dream and that has something to do with um whatever work you put in you know you you report you so [noise]\nAnd um and and I think that if if that is kind of like the the default setting where like the deepest core of the story that we're telling ourselves as a country\nThere for you know there there would then be some um suspicion that people who are not having good economic outcomes must therefore not be doing good hard work and so I think the the shaming of the poor in this country which I\nCouldn't articulate when I was a kid but I definitely felt at on on a cellular level has to do with\nThat um assumption that one's I'm a wealth\nHas some sort of correlation with one's merit\nAnd you know it goes right down to our language and I I think that some of this is so um little examined that it might it might surprise some of your listeners to to think about this that the when we say the poor we say poor people and that means\nThat means I'm a lacking financial wealth\nPour is also the also means bad it had a I'm a single word that we used for something negative poor health poor test results poor\nUm air quality and so I I don't think that those sorts of tricks of of language or a coincidence we we we live in a society that is deeply suspicious of an office contemptuous of people\nWho um who have not succeeded in the ... you know for lack of better words ... fight of um getting by and capitalism\nYou write really moving we hear about the about the stress and the toll that poverty\nIt's on bodies like if you're born for there's a really good chance that your body will wear out early based on the kinds of jobs that are available to you\n[noise] absolutely the whole uh second chapter of my book actually which is called the body of a poor girl is about the um the the mark that that class and specifically and the the working class or working poor\nUm to mark that your class assignment leaves on your physical person and that might be all the way from what I I assume this is also a term in Texas here in Kansas we say farmers can force\nYou know the ... and ... the the women too you know are just brown from the middle of thereby stepped down in the neck up and under underneath that tale from their work outside and and um and that's a sort of benign example and the uh of harrowing and and downright I'm nearly fatal example would be my\nAnd my dad's taking a job when I was in second grade um a side job driving around basically spent\nChemical waste to dispose of and he was um poisoned in the process and almost died just for his proximity to to poisonous materials that people with more money wouldn't have to mess with so so yeah it's a it's a dangerous life\nI guess to Sarah ... we're talking about her book heartland a memory of working hard and being broke in the richest country in the world you can join our conversation at one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think K.

who come up and say I've our stories are different and yet they're the same and I think that a lot of people even though their life met at MIT look very different than mine and whatever their challenges where they had a sense as a child that they were somehow responsible to their family or\nI'm a ... and and you know that can happen in a middle class or upper upper class household certainly for me it it it did I think have something to do with poverty I was probably a kid who just my disposition was such that I was very um\nYou know I was always caring for the rent to whatever litter in on the farm or um I had you know what society would call a very innate\nSense of nurturing\nUm and my being female that could be um you know I'm a by extension viewed as quote unquote maternal\nUm so so yeah as as a child and having such a a very young mother she was Seventeen when she got pregnant with me there were a lot of times on the way of growing up where I I felt like kind of a mother to myself and I'm a bit to my little brother and to my own mommy then\nAnd um and that was a you know in some ways kind of on that one of the sadness of of my upbringing um but uh but it
