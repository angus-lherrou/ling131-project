became national security advisor and I think those picked people also agitated to get rid of this operation that advantage of them more or less to the sidelines\nAnd then too I think you know the the other reason is a Trump himself\nWas kind of dismissive about the whole thing I mean anybody who realize the scope of what he was about to have to manage would have been horrified at the prospect of not having qualified people to help them to do it\nBut he he had not even really imagined the job so the fact that he was so ... is the big thing is his willingness to listen to other people telling him to do this because that that's what's odd it's ... it's odd that he didn't see how important it was\nAnd you have as a result\nThis kind of comedy that leads me into the story where you have across the federal government\nYou know a ... in the department of agriculture and commerce and energy and transportation they you know people have set up that I\nGot in a conference from and plates of finger sandwiches and the briefing books are out in parking spots of set aside for them waiting for the people that role in the day after election in ... now there's no one show that day no one shows that week or the next week in the next in in in many cases I found myself receiving briefings\nOr from people who had never given them that I was the first person to hear the briefing and so that was that that does that was material\nSo just just to make sure that we put this in context a lot of the folks that you talked to who are um agency lifers you know people who have had long careers in these agencies\nThey've been through multiple transitions ... and to be clear this one is different from any transition that they had experienced before is that right\nNo one has seen anything like this yeah ah no one had seen the level of disinterest and ... that it may be true that when Bush handed the man is the government over to Obama\nAnd the way Bush did a a ... a really pressed Obama Obama's really grateful for the care with which he handed the government or\nOr maybe that some of the briefings didn't get entirely read or not ... but but in general there were lots of meetings between the people who are leaving and he knew what was going on and the people who are coming in who did and who didn't\n[noise] okay let's step back for a minute and just talk about federal agencies most of us as I'm sure you've discovered in your reporting most average Americans are able to kind of lightly ignore what they do for us like a big part of nearly every agencies existence\nIs planning for the future and and because the majority of those employees are not political appointees their thinking on a different timetable than politicians can you help us understand why that's so important\nSo if you back away from the federal government whatever you think of it or you know if I think we'd all agree it's got a basic responsibility to keep us safe\nAnd the the ... the the kind of basket or portfolio risks it's keeping us safe from is it it's it's it's pretty breathtaking and complicated\nAnd the the ... we all have to pay some attention every now and then to the Treasury Department of the state department but there these other departments that that people pay very little attention to and their mission critical\nAnd they're thinking about things a ... in the need to be thought about so far let's take an example\nUm the department of energy into which a Trump installed Rick Perry former governor of Texas who had called for the elimination of the department of energy in a in a presidential debate\nUm actually when he left out right ... he said he wanted a lemonade three of the departments and he couldn't remember the names of one of them right at least one of them and energy was what he said he'd forgotten the name of\nWell well what does it do I'm One of the things he does is it maintains the nuclear arsenal\nAh it it assembled and it tests nuclear weapons and make sure that these bombs don't go off when they're not supposed to go off it may make it tries to make sure that I'm ... materials that might be used to make nuclear weapons don't get into the wrong hands\nUm this is a this is a complicated important job it it does\nAn awful lot of I mean if you of basic science research that made it primarily as a busy one big science operation it funds and\nHelps manage national great national laboratories that are a national treasure Livermore and San Diego and Los Alamos and in these places um what happens is\nPhysicist sewer there because of the government ... them to explore all kinds of interesting questions or get interested by the by in in how to you know cast a nuclear weapon without setting went off for example\nAnd they come to be collaborators in the process of maintaining his arsenal\nOr how it works is is kind of important and the\nUh [noise]\nIf you had to kind of like extract one of the themes that runs through that whole department is that a lot of what it's doing is on a very long time scale India they're sticking in their thinking in terms of this year and next year and the next year they're thinking in terms of the next generation\n... ... in the problems that they deal with and in the possibilities that explore so one problem the dark department energy deals with is cleaning up nuclear waste there at the expense\n... billion dollars a year in eastern Washington to clean up a the mess that was made by the generation of plutonium for the atom bombs that we dropped on Japan\nIt's a buy one conservative estimate a hundred billion dollar problem that will take a hundred years to solve\nThat the stuff that was dumped into the soil and is it in in millions of gallons and his deep under the soil and it's moving slowly towards the Columbia River and threatens to poison the Pacific northwest\nThat stuff doesn't just go away and they managed that it's a it's a and it's and they manage it ... in conditions that are not really conducive to smart law into management and very as a society that its funding it short term and paying very little attention to it and uh and what kind of answers now um\nThey they\nAre fun the happy end of the department of energy\nThey fund lots of research basic science research that industry does not uh industry increasingly I mean but this is talk long been true but increasingly\nIt you know will fund research that will pay off in five or ten years not research that pays off in twenty or Thirty years and so so that the ... the solar power energy fracking

department of energy when it has worked for they worked right which because they work for a fossil fuels company or they want to lobby for the fossil fuels industry or or their the lobbyist for the ... the soft drinks companies\nThis happened in the department of agriculture a ... you know who who want to get Pepsi back on the school lunch menu\nA because it because the agriculture department decides what what's acceptable acceptable acceptable nutrition\nIn in schools I'm so that kind of thing happens or that you have people they have a purpose but if their own narrow purpose rather than the larger public purpose\nAnd I guess I see people listening Michael who are saying well maybe the people at the very top don't matter maybe it really is sort of lifelong bureaucrats they keep these agencies running I Need to what extent is that true and to what extent does it matter who's in this job\nYou know it's funny the very people who might say that are people who have been nothing but abusive towards those bureaucrats the last four years\nYou know if they if it's that were ... that there regard them as the deep state you can't hold both positions at once if they're the ones who were actually just running thing it doesn't matter who the four thousand people who are actually running the government are\nSo first is not true if you if you it may be true for a very short term effect right now uh I mean one of the reasons not more bad things have happened in the federal government is this true civil servants the permanence civil service can step in\nAnd and and occupy jobs for a while but they don't have positive they don't have that they need positive direction they don't have the authorities move to move in one direction or another without without the political appointees telling them what to do so that it's pretty it's a pretty dysfunctional way of\nOf of running the government but the second thing is\nUm the Trump Administration came in with over hostility to those very people and to the extent they went in they went and did things like at the department of energy demand a list of names of all the department of energy employees who attended a climate change meeting\nA so they might be isolated and punished or you know or removed to foreign posting Alaska uh it it's um ... and and not surprisingly\nUh about twenty percent of the top six thousand career senior a civil service executives are left in the first year the complements direction\nSo we ... they were they've been gutting the the actual permanent civil service at the same time in and and not surprisingly demoralized\nSo I think that it might be nice actually if we change the\nStructure of our government so it was less dependent on political people more like the u._k. government or the European governments where you had this permanent civil service that basically ran the whole operation no matter who is the president but we don't have that we\nHave a we ... we have a government is heavily dependent on the people who get put in by the president\nI think I'm ... I let's go to the phones now we have Larry on the line in Houston Hi Larry\nHello go right ahead please high that I\nLike all the the question I have is is if we're talking about uh the the racial that that the uh\nUh that we we gave out the ... part of it was back back to the fifties or we had a surplus of food\nAnd raise the coach Arlen was it was a visit from having food stamps is because we gave voice for plus she is we ... we had flour and it was all given ally or as like a\nFit redistribute food that's not\nThe prices of it yeah that's why they changed it fought a lot of things are are ... that would not be there or ... what about that Michael\nWell it's ... he he I think he's right about that ... the ... the origin story the origin stories of these departments are very interesting I mean if the Justice Department was created in the first place as a as a as muscle against ... to ... to have available against the Ku Klux Klan\nUm the the energy they the Commerce Department um\nI mean the Commerce Department is misnamed the Commerce Department is the uh is actually the department of data it it would it really does is accumulate lots of data about the society the census economic statistics and all the weather data's there the national weather services inside the\nCommerce Department three quarters of the budget is above the ... members especially in ... in an environmental operation\nAnd the reason it's there is that Nixon or when they were assembling all that the environmental operations underneath this agency called no uh\nUh uh this was furious with his Interior Department secretary who who ah would naturally hosts such a thing and so he just shoved it in the Commerce Department I mean the the big ... there is a there there why they start where they start is a\nIs interesting in the history of federal programs but now that it's him it doesn't know any agriculture agriculture department\nThe ... much matter where it is the food stamp program is an extremely important program I mean it is huge number of Americans depend on it for basic basic nutrition it's it gets this\nAnybody who runs it responsibly will tell you this the problem with it is not that it's abused that it's under used that that there is some fraud and waste but it's pretty trivial\nOr the problem is that the actual benefits get distributed the state level and there are states that are hostile to the idea of feeding hungry people and they make it hard for the benefits they get to the people who need them\nAh so what you need and the job wherever it is happens to be in the department of agriculture is someone who has a gift for cutting through red tape at the state level and persuading people at the state level to get these benefits to people who need them\n[noise] um I Want to get into the story or maybe we can call it the saga of of Barry Myers um first of all tell us his previous gag and then we'll take a break and then we'll get into a to do what he's doing all\nRight so Barry Myers what was the c._e._o. of accuweather accuweather is one of the private whether companies that began really as a just a way to make it the way it made its money was distributing National Weather service forecast newspapers but but has mushroomed into something more than that and Trump\nHas appointed him to be head of NOAA the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in which sets the national weather service\nAll right that that that's a good information hang onto it will take a quick break now my guest is Michael Lewis he's a journalist who wrote books including Moneyball liars poker and the big short the new one about the transition at federal agencies between the Obama and the Trump Administration is called the fifth risk\nIf you'd like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email thinking K.
