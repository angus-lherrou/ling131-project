I'm going to back up and so he moves seven miles upstream at the same time the John Henry more leading the Texans across the river like okay we're gonna we're not going to put up with this or not taking our canon\nAnd he follows them so early on the morning of October second\nCast out he left on October first and in the evening I'm just before sundown he thought these long way more follows and he gets attacked at that point and it's a real surprise and so it's a brief skirmishes hardly anything at all\nAnd this is happening especially out of town\nIt's out of town about seven miles upstream on the west side of the loop a river\nAnd when they're doing that and they get their it stops for a little bit\nAnd caffeine is a sense of what this is talk he says why are you firing on why didn't do anything and he's he's just in fact I'm a federalist I'm In favor you know I Believe in the rye I disagree with Santana and more subtle and joined us he said but I'm a soldier first I buy orders\nAnd so at that point they go back\nTo the two sides to partly breaks down and they have another skirmish at this point cast and basically says yeah\nI'm not I was not start a war and so he begins moving back toward San Antonio\nSo victories declared ... immediately\nWe look at the first of all this is the Lexington and Concord of Texas\nWe we have an email from Mary writes my take on the battle of Gonzales even calling it the ... is that it is an example of unruly immigrants the Anglo settlers who did not want to follow the laws of the nation they were in Mexico and we're angry over the repeal of a government handout the cannon is this an accurate assessment\nTo an extent I mean they guaranteed they would give it back if I asked ... and in fact it's in the science statement when they get it Nineteen thirty one that they've asked for it back we'll get it back\nHaving said that there's a lot of other things going on at this time probably the number one that's got people upset has been the imprisonment Stephen F Austin\nThis is what we talked about when we talked about the the turtle virus right\nThere and so there's they're angry about that there's been a call for a consultation which is about to take place what should we do and so everyone's really heated now they don't like paying taxes they don't like the ... immigration section of all they all six says no more Anglo Americans coming in\nUm although we we've got to let her cousin my cousin wants to come on everybody wants to come in that is really probably the biggest issue at that point\nBut what's most interesting about this is how this is such a a tiny seemingly inconsequential skirmish but as you say it really is the Lexington and Concord of the Texas Revolution it\nDoes and in fact people start following um lieutenant back toward San Antonio\nAnd in fact this massive Texas just sort of well yeah we're going to go to an army is gonna be form Steve enough Austin's officially at first but the head of it and

I think something one way to eliminate blind spots in the debate over abortion create characters plan them on both sides\nWriter Jody ... latest novel started with research into abortion law in states around the country how abortion rates have written and pollen over time and how her life and pro choice activists tend to one another\nAnd then came the real challenge because started writing about a moment of crisis that found opponents and supporters of abortion rights in the same place at the same time and then was backward in time to explore the life experiences that led them to their deeply held convictions\nWe'll talk with the ... about what she learned in the process and about what she hopes readers will gain from her new book is lots of light or conversation starts after a short break ...\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is again answering questions about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh he spoke to reporters just before departing the White House for Philadelphia\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you're going to be a\nHealthy thing but you may not be guilty of it\nVery very very difficult time\nThe FBI meanwhile continues to investigate allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Kavanaugh even as Republicans schedule a vote and pears Windsor Johnston reports the agency is working toward a friday deadline to release the findings of its weeklong probe\nThe FBI has interviewed friends of both cab and all and his initial accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nThe agency has also spoken with a second woman who claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party in the Nineteen eighties Democrat Chris Coons who sits on the Senate Judiciary committee says all sides need to brace for whatever comes to light\nAgreeing that we should have a week for a Folsom but time and scope prescribed FBI investigation we have to recognize raises the possibility of Kavanaugh being cleared and the possibility of Dr Ford being corroborated\nSenate Republicans say vote town Kavanaugh's confirmation will come later this week Windsor Johnston NPR News\nThe Pentagon says it has detected a suspicious substance on to ... that arrived at its mail screening facility NPR's Greg Myre e has more on this investigation\nThe Pentagon says the envelopes were discovered on Monday to building we're all incoming letters and packages are checked the building is on the Pentagon grounds but not inside the Pentagon itself\nThe FBI says its agents took control of the two letters on Tuesday Morning and the bureau is conducting a more detailed analysis neither the Pentagon or the FBI has officially identified the suspicious substance\nAll other male that arrived at the Pentagon facility on Monday is currently under quarantine Greg Myre ... NPR News Washington\nSenator Bernie Sanders who has been a longtime critic of Amazon's pay practices is saluting founder Jeff Bezos for announcing that all employees will now be paid at least Fifteen dollars an hour\nUm but I have I have a lot of thoughts about it and I do think that one of the things we should look at our laws other than roe versus Wade if we know that Seventy five percent of women choose an abortion because they can't afford to have a child well why not raise the minimum wage why not have universal healthcare that would cover not just maternity\nBut also the life of your child's health and what about um\nHaving federally funded daycare what about penalizing companies that don't promote women because they have to keep leaving the workforce to have those babies those are all very interesting laws that never get discussed [noise] well\nWhat we like is a silver bullet if you'll pardon the pun in this particular situation we we want something that is a direct line to the problem that we hope to solving and all of those things or indirect lines aren't they\nWell they are but I also think that you know that that for me was the the reason for writing this book\nWhat a woman believes is different when that same woman is fourteen or thirty or forty five depending on where she is in her life\nAnd how secure she isn't how stable she is and what else is going on in her life you know I think that we're we fall on the spectrum of being pro life or pro choice\nIsn't just a matter of that fundamental beliefs but it could change for an individual woman over the course of her lifetime and when you start to pick that apart you realize that in this country we legislate reproductive rights laws are black and white the lives of women are a thousand shades of gray and therein lies the problem [noise]\nI Want to talk about the character of Dr ward who is it's the study and contradictions tell us a little bit about him\nWell Dr ward is very heavily based on a real life man named Dr Willie Parker willy is one of the doctors that I was privileged to speak with interview and then shadow while he went about his day is a working at a clinic in Alabama and Mississippi\nSo I'm Dr ward and Willie Parker are are both abortion doctors they are both devout Christians who say that they performed the service not in spite of their religion but because of it\nAnd if you talk to Willie Parker who is a very vocal um feminist and an ardent supporter of reproductive rights\nHe will tell you that she was sitting in church listening to a sermon on um [noise] uh the good Samaritan and he thought who will provide health care for these women in need if not me [laughter]\nAnd he went back and got certified to perform abortions and he began flying all over the country to the most underserved areas to perform them and that's exactly what Dr ... as well and it's like he's in Mississippi on that particular day um he's a remarkable remarkable character and it was so much fun\nCrawling around in his head space because uh\nHe reminded me so much of the real life Willie Parker who is a character and a wonderful man who enough himself\nAnd you say the real life Dr Parker understands that a fetus is a life he doesn't believe it's ... can you talk more about their instincts and\n[noise] yeah it's it's pure biology basically you know it's science and and when you actually look at um at flat out science uh we know that a life process is what happens when you fertilize an egg and it becomes an embryo and then it becomes a fetus\nThe question is at what point is that all the cells that combination of growing body functions when does that ... become a a conscious person\nUm you know and that\nHas historically been decided all over the chronology and map by religion different religions believe different things\nAnd of course if you're Catholic you believe that life begins at conception there are other religions um that say that a a a baby isn't a person until like forty days after birth I mean it's really it's totally out there depending on what you believe\nBut scientifically we know it's a life process I'm an any doctor will tell you that they just will not they will not agree that it is a person while in utero\nAnd you know someone who is pro life will argue oh but we have priming janitor we're constantly giving rights to the unborn legally well that's true but someone pro choice will say All right but you have to be born in order to act on those rights and for them that is the dividing line\nYou know you have to be born you have to be able to survive without being connected to a uterus in some way or you know some kind of of a medical assistance to stay alive\nThere really is no way to draw a solution that is sad I mean that's where we haven't right but the the reason we're still arguing about a decades after it's been settled law is that there's no way there's no one from both sides to sort of get what they want with a single policy\nNo absolutely not\nAnd you know with that said I think it's really important to ask well where do we go from here ... because I can tell you we're never going to a great period [noise]\nSo what I Would like to propose having done all this research art several things I think it's really important to start with a couple of basic premises which is a that\nNobody wants to have an abortion\n[noise] you know you don't wake up and go I have nothing better to do today it's a very heavy and and well well thought out decision even for a woman who chooses to terminate a pregnancy so with that\nMind obviously the easiest way to decrease the abortion rate is to not get pregnant right [noise] and yet the people who are often the most ardent pro life are also very often anti contraception\nThat to me is a really interesting and hypocritical argument because suddenly the argument shift away from this is the fetus is a person this baby is a person it's already human it's already it's already a human being\nToo I'm less control women sexuality\nAnd I'm confused by that now I Am admittedly also not Catholic and I'm I Do not have that kind of kids in behind me\nAnd I've spoken to many wonderful women who have explained to me why they feel that the church is really important to them and why they feel that choosing not to use contraception is their choice rather than something that's being handed down to them\nAnd I think that's totally great if it works for them as long as they can recognize it may not work for for other people\nUm you know but I Do think we need to unpack that a little I think we need to ask why if people really want the abortion right to go down we are and then trying hard to increase access to contraception and sex ed\nMy guest is novelist

current situation of you know where they live and who the father is and what else is going on in their life\nThis is the right decision for them\nThey would never tell you that you have to go have an abortion that would be particularly but they they would like I think other women to understand why it might be the right decision for them the character of them themselves I mean\nThe character of Georgia is really interesting here this is the vigilante who stormed the women's center as a kind of vengeance for his daughters abortion [noise] even if he's doing this sort of caught up in this in this rage that he's had and then he's realizing he doesn't feel the way he thought he would\n[noise] right and you know there's that\nThat weird sense of vigilante justice and he's doing this for his daughter but he also recognizes that he's taking a life\nYou know he's gone in and he's killed several people and he's his motivation for going into this clinic is because people in his mind or taking away the lives of children so you know does that make him any better than what he's arguing against and I think that kind of hits him a little late\nAnd my guess is novelist Jodi Pico we're talking about her new book a spark of light if you'd like to join the conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd All right let's go to the phones now we have Barbara calling from Houston Hi Barbara\nHigh\nHigh go right ahead plates I Barbara [laughter]\nUm I just wanted to make a point that um that are the authors said that they're that\nCatholics you know on Catholic or that kind of like they're not you birth control a now while the tagline is that they don't use artificial means the birth control we do offer natural natural family planning classes\nIt's a continuing education where women and learn in their bodies are fertile and they can either choose to plan on having a baby or they can avoid the fertile period of time I just wanted to\nMake yes point I was yes Barbara you're of course you're right and I've talked to many many Catholic women who have information that I Will also let you know and I'm sure you know that there are lots of people for whom natural family planning does not work and many of them wound up with an unwanted pregnancy as well\nWhy do we have such a high rate of teenage pregnancies in the United states as compared with Canada or just about every country in Europe\nWill I can tell you the answer to that [laughter]\nSo in America there are Thirteen birth per thousand teenage girls in Canada it is a six per thousand in Sweden er and France I think it's seven per thousand ... it is I'm considerably less in many many other first world countries\nAnd we know from studies that have been done globally the difference is available free birth control\nContraception and um the a predominant of sexual education classes at the the school level so what happened that that it it it literally makes a difference that's it that's what reduces the teen pregnancy rate what\nDid you learn about why the number of abortions in the U.S has been declining in recent years\n[noise] so that's a really interesting statistic and um\nWhat's fascinating about it is that yes we have seen a decline in the abortion rate however it's a little bit of a false statistic because if you break out the the numbers abortions have been declining for excuse me for rich women but they have been rising steadily for disadvantaged swimming for poor women\nAnd that is of course but for me the really important thing to think about when we talk about roe versus Wade you know if roe versus Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court it's not as if abortion suddenly disappears what really happens is it goes back to the states\nAnd the reason this becomes an issue is because there are seven states right now that have only one abortion clinic and the only reason that clinic is still in existence is because of the little phrase and roe versus Wade undue burden that there can be undue burden on a woman going to get an abortion [noise]\nUm yeah once that laws overturned those clinics disappear and I think we'll see a lot of states particularly in the Bible belt in the south where we don't have any clinics in the state and in that case you have a poor woman who becomes at the mercy of her ZIP Code\nA rich women will always be able to travel to get an abortion but we can't say that about poor woman and that's why we tend to see that women of color and poor women are the ones who are most affected by the two hundred and eighty plus laws that have become a state level threat to reproductive rights\nThe other hand you don't believe that overturning roe v Wade would end abortions went up\n[noise] I I I think that there will continue to be\nClinics in the north um I think it would be very hard for\nA for roe versus Wade to completely be wiped out I think what will actually happen is that I'm like I said\nIt will not be a federal law it will be decided at the state level and so different states particularly the ones I imagined that are considered progressive where are the ones that are northern states I'm On the eastern seaboard will continue to have clinics [noise]\nUh I don't I I think to put America back in a place where abortion is illegal we're going to see such an incredible rate of maternal deaths\nWe thought before we know what will happen again a but again it's going to be affecting poor people women of color because a lot of rich women are going to be able even if they have to leave the states they can do it they can cross in Canada they need to um you know if you become you're at the mercy of your of your economic privilege\nMy guess is novelist Jodi
