{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Dumping into that mood discussion how do you set the mood in a horror story you know 'cause when you watch a horror movie there's so much going on there's visuals their sound there's all this kind of stuff that helps how do you do that with just writing\nWell I think writing is a very visual experience and I'm I'm influenced by novels and short stories and comics but also by the cinema and by radio shows and by story tellers and I think you pick up on the little telling pieces of\nDetail that's what makes the difference is how things male and what they feel like and and those things can be described swiftly and politically and you don't have to do it constantly or otherwise it becomes too much of an obvious gimme but I think you have to be aware of the senses when you arrived\nI Know that some of your stories they're not just straight up you know terrifying works of horror you you also tend to sometimes a its use a little bit of a satire and humor and your horror especially with something like bubble hotel or something like that where where does that sort of come from\nWell I think that ... humor or opposite sides of the same coin\nYou know it's I think Robert block used to say that you know it's just that something that's really horrifying is actually kind of humorous if you look at it from a different angle and that's the same in reverse Mark Twain used to say there's no humor in heaven and what he meant is that all humor is based on somebody's discomfort\nEmbarrassment arm pain and when you think about it that's pretty accurate\nYou've written for for a long time you've you've been a writer for several decades if you can describe it\nOr how is the the genres you write for especially horror or how would they changed over that period in which you've been writing you know are are we still scared of the same things we were scared of Twenty years ago or the or their new things to be scared of\nWhy I think there's always new things to be scared of it but it's essentially the same stuff I mean you know the\nFear of the un no fear what's gonna happen and a lot of monsters or just a stand in for you know fear of um the future of fear of the dark here what might happen to our family I think they just become a metaphorical\nAnd uh so to me it's the same things but the approach to it varies from generation to generation I think that a lot of suspense has borrowed from the mood and attitudes of horror\nWhere before it was a little different and I think that a lot of ... has borrowed from the more suspenseful pacing of of thrillers and things like that but I you know it it cross genres and and sometimes it just goes back to the roots\nI mentioned films earlier and I know that some of your works have been adapted for for film and television especially as the creator you know sort of seeing okay someone's taking my piece of art and translating it to the big screen or the or the small screen how how do you feel about that process\nWell so far I've been very lucky I mean you always feel as a writer that there could have been this or that but you know ... was a story of mine and I felt extremely happy with that because I thought it was like Ninety eight percent my story and what I wrote and I felt very\nGratified and ah some crime things that might have been done and I think they've been very good to maybe not quite\nTo the degree that but the hotel was but I've been lucky I had an incident on and off a mountain road short story of mine that was adapted for masters of horror and uh I I felt it came out well and I have some things that are in the pipeline right now that I'm hoping you also satisfied\nSo speaking of of some of those adaptations you're happen Leonard series received a TV adaptation and just this year you released a new normal in a series of ... what does that series about\nWhether ferries is about two guys in east Texas warm when one is white and straight and very liberal and the other is black conservatives are a Republican and he's gay and it's based on a people I Know or have known and oh it seems\nTo be probably my most

such a big deal last night and why it's the only thing that most people in that particular tribe or going to talk about and if you try to walk into it'd be like you know there's no national championship till January what's the big deal it's it's still October\nYou might get shined right but if you have somebody to walk you through this process you can come to understand you can come to learn and you can come to get to know people that are different than you who believe something that you originally didn't have any use for\nOkay so you decide that you're going to do this you want to get close to your future father in law um teacher now former father in law and and so you decide that you're going to learn to shoot I'm the first time that you went out with him it was awkward\nYeah

also fish in your pocket but\nThat's what I had and I was asking him to help me and learn how to use it\nUh it was still something I was very unfamiliar with\nIt was still something that I knew that if I was not reference about I can not only hurting myself like hurt someone else\nSo we are standing with each other a at are staging area where I had my firearm um was he had her fire and her brother in law my brother in law at his and Charles had his\nAnd I'm so skittish about how to use this thing that I Want to ask questions but that's not really how Charles is built he wants to see how you react under pressure not [noise] yeah so he just says you know a plant started she started\nThat that was that was the instruction that I got mhm right so I pointed started shot target\nI hit a damn thing I didn't hear anything I I I [laughter]\nI feel so terrible because it wasn't that far away you know we're talking about ten yards tops were talking about first down here right and I I I didn't know what I was doing wrong I ... I thought I was aiming correctly I thought that I was\n[laughter] pulling the trigger you know pull a trigger you know I'm I was using my one hand I had bad\nStance I had bad body position I wasn't using my daughter had all these things working against me that I Wish somebody would have just kind of clue me in on but that wasn't the point the point was okay now how are you going to deal with this but crucially\nI thought the gun had jammed right after I shot at just the one time and I didn't know what to do so I still have this gun pointed at target because you don't planning on anybody ever for any reason except to destroy that person right and I had that in my head I have that real through\nAnd I'm I'm asking for him to help me and he walks up and he takes the gun from me I'm [laughter]\nPot puffs magazine in there because hey it it's sledding out 'cause I didn't pop it in there with enough force because I was just about it then he fired three shots you hit the target and told me after turning the gun sideways don't hold it like this\nYou know in that hit me you know like like you might picture a criminal or um [noise] what some people call a thug in a bad way I'm\nLike like what that was what I was in that moment to him\nAs if that would be the way you hold the gun because you are sort of fulfilling his his expectation of what like a gang bangers looks like\nYeah but also as a joke and that's kind of the thing that was really hurtful about is that we still haven't come so far as you didn't know that just wouldn't be funny to me uh-huh you know it it

have a conversation about race and come to some fundamental understanding about what that means\nBecause the laws look the same on paper but but in reality it's not the same to be a black person in possession of a weapon that you have legal right to\nLaws by themselves or are awesome I think most people would agree that rules are pretty good who's enforcing the rules are people and people are
