signs of distress and frustration but not violence or unrest do you feel you feel that there is a um\nBoat you know in in a lot of ways this book\nIs a sports book I thought it was very important actually to right from the perspective of somebody who had played the sport\nYou know so many sports books it especially now a very rightfully so are so critical of this game it means so much to so many of us even though we have suffered mightily far physically and otherwise um it it's a it's a beautiful beautiful experienced transcending experience and I try\nTo capture that but also the football material in the book operates is sort of a political metaphor when I was a freshman at Yale the team was horrible\nAnd uh my class of freshman wherever thirty of us many of whom had no business at Yale I'm but were decent football players actually so we staged a coup\nAgainst the upper class men as freshmen and took over the team and I write about us as being a week to calm that some collective trauma had transformed the nature of the collective itself\nHas created within a team of a hundred and twenty people the team with entertain a week to come and we went on to be the most successful class in a generation won a championship almost one second\nI think we're in a very similar moment here in America there has been such a collective trauma or to occur in my generation and beyond and I think we're in the early days of a beautiful and sort of dangerous revolution\nOr in terms of the ways we live in this world in terms of the ways that we organize and participate in this society uh and I think that revolution and starting on the inside just as that football revolution started with twelve kids\nYou know standing on the sidelines Sam wow these upper class middle really suck [laughter] we got to take their jobs and I think some of that is happening at the political level in American I Try to capture them in the book as well\n[noise] we're talking about your mom I'm before you knew anything about bipolar disorder you have memories of her um I guess when you're just a really small kid ... memories of her laughing and crying more than anybody else you knew for a longer duration you remember her suffering a seizure driving school\nHow did you make sense of all that and did anybody talk to you about it\n[noise] Mm [noise] um no no one spoke to me\nAbout it uh and [noise] you know one of the things people sometimes criticize me for about this book or in general are tend to criticize right as far as what you don't have any solutions what's the alternative\nAnd actually I have a whole ... page list of alternative that I might published at some point one of which is to tell the truth to children ...\nUm when I was writing this book my mother who is such a magical and was such a magical creature she disappeared when I was Thirteen and came back when I was Eighteen or after the you know in that time I assume she was dead so she sort of I guess it raises a self from the dead and returns when I'm Eighteen\nBut while I was writing this book she started disappearing again I mean you know a\nMental illness is something that is so horribly addressed in our society and and and so I've learned a lot from my mother about this anyway at when she started disappearing again as I was writing this book my niece was twelve\nAnd a it was so heartbreaking to see her go through without going through at the same age\nAnd be able to even without her say any thing kind of know um you know she start checking on people just out of the blue you know made these very small things that on the surface don't seem particularly troubling\nBut I think I'm I recognized in them so many of the ways that I Try to bring some order to the world\nUm when everything else seemed to be falling apart\nAnd one of the things is booked helped me to do was to actually have honest conversations with my niece about this very traumatic thing that was going on first of all to tell her that all of those negative things that she feels about my mother or ... totally fine and valid you know I have a whole paragraph\nIn the book when my mother returns I say I want it to disfigured her\nYou know I had to be honest about that very raw negative hatred that I felt for this person who meant a great deal to me doing something really horrible that's the first thing I wanted to do with my niece and with other young people who are going through this\nThe nastiest Ross feelings you have about these awful things they're okay one to a that's not the end of it you see you're not alone or there's something on the other side of that pain and that trauma\nBut third and this is perhaps the most important thing one of the most important things in this book and then I've learned um I had to uh right past my pain to see my mother as a human being not as my employee\nYou see and when I did that I realized that the worst thing that ever happened to me\nWas actually perhaps the most important thing that she ever did for herself\nRight she had to get away from all the stuff that was killing her and ah and I really do understand that and so in some ways I tell people my mother reminds me a bit of blanche dubois from\nStreetcar named desire really she's really I mean if you made a she's a big star man she's great [noise]\nUm [noise] but um but I\nJust tell the story nor should we tell any story from one perspective I had to tell the story of here is a free person trying to figure out how to live\nIn a world that caused them crazy and then take them seriously and and really kind of cuts them up and ... it's so interesting that you were able to get there because no matter what um [noise]\nWhen your mother leaves and has any amounts of volition and doing that it it it's kind of feel personal it's got to feel like it was about you even if it wasn't\nA write in the book if ever your mother asked you to choose between her death and disappearance have heard that ... always\nThough not immediately of course about my editor who was fantastic I mean she really I'm a thank God for her every day she wanted to take that out you know she's a mother she says cases I think that's a bit harsh I said well yeah it is harsh that's why I'm putting it in the book is also a good sense of hope\nBut you know death is clean you know a dozen elegance to its you know I mean it's very expensive my my ... my gosh the the rates they charge people to bury folks these days is absurd but\n[noise] um but a death is clean and a disappearance is a real close to and it creates this lingering sense of uncertainty this deal at thirty one years old you know I went to therapy or the other day and my therapist um\nWas five minutes late and her name wasn't on the board and I said oh my God she's taking my money Iran you know I mean I've had a live thirty one years old have this paranoia that everybody's gonna lay and is going to take me a long time perhaps

you don't have to do that anymore uh the reality and this is one of the big interventions of this book\nIs that the standard of success that we have in this society\nDemands a sort of mutilation from so many people young people especially people from the right side of the tracks places like a cliff or you know I'm In LA places like Compton or you know I go to New Orleans places like the Lower Ninth ward\nA demands as sort of mutilation shortly after I started this book one of my closest friends from Yale\nA kid whose child that had been much like mine Hispanic kid\nOr who was like little brother to me and had helped recruit him um he took his own life\nAnd I'm not long after that you came to me in a dream\nAnd he was sitting in a booth in a in a diner and I got into the part of the book where I have to start writing about my time at Yale and when I went there there were posters put up in every school in Dallas to with\nFace on it that said look who's going to jail he did it you can too\nAnd I was about to start writing about this and I got so sad and I couldn't write and I took a nap aided by low bourbon which is like the right as best friends and uh and my friend came to me in the stream and he was sitting in this boat in this crowded diner and he laid back and he said\nYou know Casey we did a lot of things that we wouldn't advise anybody we loved to do\n... and I knew exactly what he meant I knew that if you look at it from the right angle aboard picking himself up by his bootstraps looks just like a suicide\nAnd I felt at my job in this book to confess to make planes those things and hopefully to keep or some other young people either young people in my generation of young people who are in elementary school today from feeling that pressure\nTo um mutilate themselves to put themselves in little boxes to leave half of themselves at home and take half of themselves to you you see to feel that that bargain is worth it\nUh and to really um hopefully imagine
