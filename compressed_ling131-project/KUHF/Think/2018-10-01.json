{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Well okay let's start with some positives first of all defensively they from was passed rush standpoint they looked like a team the team that a lot of people wanted them to be your daddy incline he was a human wrecking machine as was J J what this is exactly now\nConversely the colds have a terrible offensive line and we're not been good all year but the Texans were in the backfield it seemed like all day long\nI'm Sean Watson was again very good at yet quarterback and the younger rookie Kiki Kuti came in as a slot receiver had eleven catches over a hundred yards and his debut they ran him a lot in the backfield with odd reverses and Mr actions that was the good stuff I think on the bad side\nYou know they gave us they came into the game as they Andrew Luck had not thrown a pass for more than thirty five yards all year and I just jokingly said on Twitter that will change today three plays into the game he threw an for forty yards I think the thing is is that from a past events the Texans just were not good they gave up Eighteen points\nThey had no business winning this game if not for like one of the most bizarre play calls that I've ever personally seen in a game in overtime by the colds those actions would not have won this game they probably ended up time this game if not for that\nTo soccer now the Houston died of a claim the u._s. open cup last Wednesday with a three nothing went over Philadelphia is this a win this franchise can build off of\nYes and no I think on one hand it's great you know it it it is a prestigious award at some it's an important one it it lends to some things later where they can play international play and that sort of thing\nI'm On the other side though it speaks to some of the deficiencies they've had over the course of their season you know the difference between the tournament and the seasons and tournament you catch fire\nSuddenly be really good and sort of run the table you have to but to win over the course of the season you have to be consistently good for a long period of time and then it gets sort of amplified some of those deficiencies they've had being consistent over a whole season\nBut from a standpoint of this tournament it's great for them and I think it's it's always good to win something like that\nThat said the data also defeated San jose three Saturday and MLS play with four games left in the season they are now five points out of that age and final play out and bought in the western conference I mean they need help certainly a lot you know it is it's so outrageous to think the dynamo have a shot\nIt's not outrageous but they play most of their games on the road to finish the season we know they have not been good they're a Salt Lake city sort of help save their season a little bit by tying in against sporting Casey in Kansas City I which I don't think anybody expected them to do\nI just think it's highly there's no one that writes about the MLS on the regular that thinks the dynamo we're going to be in the playoffs I think it's just a very highly unlikely that they will make it but look they are a team that seems to have gotten better as the season progressed and you saw it come through in that in the in the tournament play so we'll see\nAnything's possible but I Would say at this point it's very doubtful\nTeam that wins big games can maybe when the games again you'd like to think so you're out with a couple on the road that nobody expects and suddenly yeah you know you'd like to believe that will see the Houston Rockets preseason schedule against tomorrow with a game against the grizzlies what will you look for during the pre season\nMostly I'm looking at two things chemistry for one how are these new guys fitting in how it's not just Carmelo Anthony that house James in is spinning in Michael Carter Williams what does it rotations kind of looking like\nSecond thing is how are they competing defensively that's really going to be the key for them I think all season long\nThe rockets think that they will be as good if not better than they were defensively I'm Still a little skeptical of that but I I think they have a chance reading James and this is much better defender than people think I think Michael Carter Williams is very good so we'll see um I I those are the things I'll be looking for in the pre season for sure you know pretty soon the basketball's incredibly boring\nShould we anticipate any other roster moves before the beginning of the regular season\nYou know the Jimmy butler thing is still out there floating around I don't know if the rockets are going to be able to make that deal happen and I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure I Would depending upon what what the players are involved\nBut it's still out there and tell that settled I don't think we know for sure I still think it's somewhat unlikely um but we'll have to keep an eye on it or they predictions for the Astros and Cleveland I think the ... going to win I think probably it's a you know I think they're probably gonna win in short order\n... he writes for Hugh stony a magazine and the Houston fresh he joined

first president to lose a war [noise]\nWe are asking Americans to think about that [noise] because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die and yet now how do you ask a man to be the last man to die from the state [noise]\nEven twenty seven years old how did your decision to speak out about your sense of the ways that the country had gone wrong with the war in Vietnam aligned with your understanding of patriotism\nWell I Believe it was ... and I think it it's it's as we said many times at that period of time when people would attack us for a allegedly a not ... to the party line or the national line and and supporting our\nCountry no matter what in fact we had people shattered as I remember sometimes people would say you know my country right or wrong and we'd say yeah I was right keep it right and what is wrong make it right I mean or some of them and say well you guys do to support the troops and I hear some that back in may shout lady we are the troops I mean we\nTold the truth and sometimes when you tell the truth and you're ahead of it a little bit\nOf a lot of flak comes or way\nUm I think history has pointed out we've seen Robert ... book\nA in which he acknowledges that he knew it wasn't going to turn out the way they want it and yet they persisted and they never said stop and and held themselves accountable read Neal GM's bright shining lie one of the most brilliant books written about that war\nAnd and you see how early much of the deception and the lying and self delusion and so forth took place\nSo um there were many people I wasn't alone in this effort there were lots of people here in the country or against the war and there were lots of vets who came back or against the war and lots of us who are over there and one of my very closest friends done drugs or was not\nFor the war at the time and he was killed three or four weeks after I left\nUm there are other people who came back feeling that it just was a mistake it was a it was being badly run and wasn't there was strategically lacking and uh\nAnd the fundamental threshold decisions that you need to make before he decided to go war not been properly made I eat what are we doing there what's achievable what are we able to do what's the strategy and I'm\nIn fact we entered into a civil war and we got right in the middle of a civil war we made it a proxy war began proxy war with China and Russia being involved in the background and the whole notion that do you got to stop communism and there because if you don't stop that they're the domino theory nations are going to fall one after the other\nWell the fallacy of that has now been proven many times over but we stood up for what we believed was a articulation of the truth in the best interests of our country\nAnd patriotism is standing up for your country\nNow that can take different shapes informs sizes certain times\nAnd um it was very hard for some people to fathom I think now people understand that we actually save lives\nThat we created a political dynamic where it became a voting issue and the war and therefore politicians began to respond and indeed Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and others moved to end it\nUh as as soon as they deemed practicable um but I think that was I think the people who oppose the war we're\nJust as patriotic as people who supported and that's the terrible thing about a war that is in such a conflict with the the thinking of the people that's why you need to have the American people fully understand and fully support fully buy in to what you're trying to do if you're going to send young Americans into harm's way\nYou get him here I'm a deep conversation that you had with John McCain late Senator John McCain on exactly this issue um can you tell us a little bit about that\nAnd sure well John McCain and I came from very different places initially when we went to the Senate he from a prisoner of war five and a half years I'm with an unspeakable you know torture and and uh you know\nDuring the course of those years and I was of course in a different more from him he was in the air or others down in the ... and I'm interacting with people and seeing first and sort of how to land war was going and so we um\nWe're senators I came to the Senate couple of years before him but we were together in an airplane flying to Kuwait after Desert Storm and John and I were sitting opposite each other and neither of us have fallen asleep late into the night\nWe started talking and we just talked and talked and uh I asked John many things about Annapolis about the academy about his father or his grandfather the tradition of their family how he got through the Hanoi Hilton what what it was like\nA flying I mean we talked about a lot\nHe asked me a lot of questions about the war I'd seen and being against the war and so forth and what we've resolved that night and I write in the book I write about the conversation and the experience of standing and John McCain cell with him in ...\nWhich is remarkable but John and I resolved that our country which we both loved\nAnd both signed up for the same reasons we felt a sense of duty and responsibility\nWe felt that our country was still being torn apart by the end on there were still residual ill feelings within families and from one veteran do another uh people who were for it and people who are against it and we thought we needed to try to heal that wound\nAnd one of the ways we thought we could do it was by a resolving the question of T O W MIA were there are people still alive and dead done and that was the precursor to being able to change the relationship was yet I'm itself and move beyond the war began to treat them like a country not a war\nWorked together for ten

Iran nuclear agreement and I won't but but\nPeople need to understand what the president is done by pulling out of that agreement is actually make the world more dangerous he he has\nHe has a empower the I. R. G. see that the Republican Guard in Iran hardliners had been empowered because he pulled the rug out from under President Rouhani who took the chance of negotiating with the United states when others in Iran were warning him don't do this you can't trust the United\nStates and and so a Donald Trump has now made that clear and the and and there's no greater tribute I mean I'm not sitting around a I'm Upset for our country but I'm not upset personally about it um I I Do\nThink however that the fact that China Russia Germany France and Britain and Iran are all working to keep the agreement\nAnd they just had a meeting in two days ago in New York while President Trump's in New York they met at the un in order to discuss how they're going to keep the agreement together so what do they know that Donald Trump doesn't know\nI mean all of these leaders are committed to this day and and even if you let me make clear\n\nIn the Obama administration president bottom myself others none of us\nWere lacking and concern for what Iran does in the region\nWe kept the sanctions in place on Iran\nOn their missiles on their support for Hezbollah on their human rights abuses on their transfer weapons to Yemen\nWe kept sanctions and we even raised us sanctions while we were negotiating the Iran deal so I don't take a second seat that Donald Trump or anybody about the ... that Iran can create in the region the question is how do you best deal with it\nAnd if you're going to deal with it and this is what I said and by the way I had a long conversation was secretary upon pale before they made the decision in which I told him what I had learned from the Iranians what I thought would work in order to do to be successful in the policy and that was\nTell the Iranians OK guys will like these five or six things you're doing in the region you got to change them\nAnd we're going to stay in this agreement for the next two years because it keeps you from having a nuclear weapon but we're we're giving you that amount of time to work with us to try to change these other things that way you would have brought China Russia Germany France and Britain with you and they would be supportive of what we're doing now rather than\nBeing completely disrespectful and frankly and questioning of the um of the approach of the administration the administration is fundamentally trying to crush the regime there trying to have regime change by closing off their economies so there'll be a quote revolution but they really don't understand rainy and mentality\nFrom the ... from the shootings that just took place the other day in Iran there's a big couple of articles in various international newspapers about how that is strengthened the regime\nAnd strengthened Iranian nationalism against external efforts to try to throw the government out so they're going at it the wrong way and and these are a proud people five thousand years of history I disagree with their engagements but the way to change them is to engage them\nNot attack them the way they've been attacked they think I'm ...\nI guess if our as former U.S secretary of State John Kerry his new memoir is called every day is extract\n[noise] um [laughter] so you orchestrated the back channel negotiations\nThat even made it possible ... holders to the table to get the Iran nuclear deal done there and he's an arduous negotiations and all these different parties and you know if one thing changes another thing has to happen over here\n[noise] [noise] how is it possible that all that was ultimately successful but you weren't able to sell this to the American people\nWhile they're not going to be able to support the\nAmerican people support it and Congress I mean if the guy made a little bit by President Trump will became a political football beg your pardon not people who supported President Trump well no because President Trump has spent two years with the presidential podium and the podium of a campaign for president\nHammering the deal is the worst deal in American history\nAh but seeing it especially Donald Trump saying it doesn't make it that not at all that's why\nPoint to president Xi president boom you know president Macron prime minister may and Chancellor Merkel all think this is a very good deal most countries do most people involved in proliferation believe it's a good deal by the way the security community in Israel believed it was a good deal\nThe generals in the Pentagon believed it was a good deal they didn't want to get out General Mattis the defense secretary didn't want it out Rex Tillerson from Texas when he was secretary didn't think we ought to get out so there are plenty of people who have a different position from President who's dead wrong on what what he was saying this agreement\nThe single strongest most transparent most accountable most far reaching nuclear agreement on the planet around and have to do more to comply than any other nation has had to do they literally destroyed\nCentrifuges that do enrichment they have to destroy their plutonium reactor could never be used again and we verified the destruction\nThey have to have a limit on their stockpile rich material they have twenty five years of TV cameras tracking every ounce of uranium that his mind for the lifetime for as long as they're in the agreement\nWe have the right of challenge\nOf any facility and around that we think they might be making mischief and we get to go in and inspect and if they don't let us in within twenty eight days\nThen every sanction automatically comes back in place I mean this is an incredibly yeah we have a hundred and thirty additional inspectors in Iran looking at their facilities on a daily basis you pull out\nYou'll lose all that you lose any right to complain of control and everything and you get right back on the track that is leading you to conflict and yeah I heard it President Obama hurt it King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia look\nMe in the eye and said you need to bomb Iran that's the only thing they'll understand President Mubarak of Egypt said you need to bomb Iran the prime minister of Israel came over to Washington and visited with the president wanted permission to go bomb Iran folks\nIf you want another war and you want to send young Americans to yet another Middle Eastern country or and fight yet another Muslim country that is the track you get on presidents on that track in a way\nBut if you want to be common sense approach to how you make the world safer and deal with nuclear proliferation as Ronald Reagan did with Gorbachev when you negotiated you negotiate an agreement like we did\nMy guest is former secretary of state and five term US Senator John Kerry his new memoir everyday is
