Thirteen win against buffalo Texans now find themselves in a three way tied for first place in the AFC South to what do you attribute this turnaround in the standings [laughter]\nYou know you said there have been like I don't I Can't remember the word but basically the ugly three losses they were ugly three when Jimmy\nThey played bad teams you know the NFL is nothing if not filled with parity I mean you look around and there's only a a one undefeated team a couple was one ... one when the rest are just three and two two and three you know one in four it's there's a lot of that mix and\nThe Texans are in that mix they play in a bad division and and they played against the real bad teams it's taken them to overtime and pick fixing the fourth quarter to win them\nSo it's not exactly they're playing great football but hey when is a win at this point\nIt's nice though to be on the other side is nit pick six is late in the the football game\nYeah yeah it is and I think look again if you're the Texans you take them any way you can get them and defensively they've they've been good you know are they they've been one of the better teams I think recently defensively off instantly there's still a train wreck and you know they're just going to have to try and figure that out and better to be doing that tied for the division lead them to be doing it from the seller\nThere was concern heading into Sunday's game that the Sean watching might not play or might be hobbled after getting knocked around so badly in recent weeks how they look\nNot great I mean he had two interceptions one that wasn't entirely his fault he had a couple of ... one that was he recovered and one that was turned over\nLook he is beat up you've got hit twelve more times in this game sack seven more times they just cannot allow him to get beat up like that back there is some of it is his fault you know he is the type of guy who wants to do everything he can to make a play regardless of what harm it does to him but\nSome of it is on this team just data offensive line and and real offensive struggles uh they've got to protect him and he's not going to make it through the season\nThe Houston Rockets closed out the NBA preseason friday with a one Twenty one one of the three went over the grizzlies or the rockets ready to roll\nYeah I think they are the rotation seem to be set the

by game against the Lakers on Saturday in the clippers Sunday what will you watch for these for your games\nI think it's really I Want to see their rotations and I want to see their defensive intensity throughout these gains look the rockets on a talent level and on and off in some level are going to beat a lot of teams just because they're just better than they are\nUm I'm going to be interested to see how they maintain that intensity sort of winning intensity that defensive intensity\nUh that's going to be the most interesting to me and I think will be the key to see how they're going to progress throughout the year\nIt appears Jimmy Butler will start the season with the Minnesota timber maybe a but reportedly the tables are still pursuing a trade partner for 'em or any

core\nA breakup their chemistry and ordered they want to address the butler they liked to the reports are that Minnesota wants to not only are recording but also PJ Tucker which I think is probably a mistake he is so important as a player to what they do on both ... and defense that really kind of direct their chemistry\nJimmy ... is a great player but I don't think you give them up if it means destroying the opportunity to be really really good and I think that is a possibility\nBefore we wrap up we learned last week that former rockets coach and NBA offensive ... winter has died what's

and three other counties in the Sierra foothills the proactive electricity shut offs but some school districts to cancel classes for the day\nLet's see the first and last president to inspire that level of times\nWe certainly the first and last president to get universally a in a unanimous Lee she's me unanimously a elected in the electoral college um I Would say actually he's the first president than last person to have that universal trust I think we also remember\nThroughout his two terms in office he was not so universally loved you as a political figure whether he liked it or not he was criticized the right and left but ... you what are you criticize his policies are criticizes ideas\nNo one really had good standing to criticize his devotion to the country and that really was the key for the founders\nSo they're trying to figure out what to do in the event that someone comes along who as not as moral and why as as and trustworthy at George Washington and its he Williams in of North Carolina comes up with this idea of impeachment which um he said making the president removable on impeachment and conviction of malpractice or neglect of duty\nBut then there's the matter up deciding exactly what kinds of neglect and offenses um would you characterize as malpractice tell us about the kinds of conversations that surrounded\nThat yeah this is actually I think the most fascinating part of the story because the idea of impeachment actually goes back several centuries before and British common law and the idea that a person to removed from office because they were bad at it because they were incompetent and the word that they use often was malice administration the opposite of good administration\nThat a person who was removed from office for these problems of competency\nWell if you could remove somebody for competency competency is is a really subjective I so anyone who has the power to remove another branch of government or moving official\nFor a subjective reason\nWell that essentially mixed that person's subservient to the higher authority so policymakers and as I said there the architects of the constitution really wrestled quite ... quite with great difficulty over\nHow to define and come to terms with the idea that we need to find some way so that Congress can't just remove a president because they don't like him\nOr can't just move or president because they don't like his policies\nBecause they knew that that would happen\nThey assumed would happen I mean they they they were classically trained all these gentleman um they really read their their democratic history if you will of Greece and Rome and they understood that any power that was up ... that was possible for\nA a form of government that form a government would assume there to freeze is another way there's a wonderful phrase that they use all the time\nThat power encroaches that power is always grasping power always wants to extend itself so if you give a power to a branch of government in this case if you give Congress the ability to added swim remover president the presumption is they will\nSay you have a team in basements set a ... it with helium send 'em and then there's governor Morris of Pennsylvania and it's not he wasn't governor of Pennsylvania right this is a you know different spelling yeah go governor here like okay thank you um ... why did he objects the possibility of impeachment\nWell simply for the reason he didn't want to give too much power into any ... any one branch there he was really worried that if we have someone who is impeachable\nThan that would essentially remove their ability to act independently and crucially remove their ability to act as a check against the other power in this case the legislature and he actually had really pragmatic view of this he said you know the truth matter is if a person is a bad president\nThey will be voted out of office the next term if a person is a you know ... dastardly president they too will be voted out of office in an extra essentially he said\nTime solve all problems and that the disruption and the destruction of the political system that would come inevitably from trying to remove one branch of government by another\nThat that's worse in many ways than just letting things right out and I have to say this is a a real you know if you will Eighteenth century idea the notion of time\nTime I get a lot less down in four years in the Eighteen century\nWound and you you had a lot less worried about nuclear missiles or to be honest so this is something I think that argument that it's difficult for us to wrap our minds around we think you know the next news cycle is is too long and here is is more is arguing that well\nIn case of the really bad president just sit tight and worked to get him a removed from office next election\n[noise] so um that was a pragmatic argument and made makes some sense and Franklin comes along with a truly realistic argument and says listen\n[laughter] well you know one of one of the things about Franklin and this is not my phrase but it's often used that he is the founder who links at us and all of his writings that he never entirely sure when he's making a joke or not which I think was also part of his political power at the time so Franklin makes the point in the middle of the constitutional convention\nThat really a president should embrace the idea of impeachment embrace the idea of a trial if they do something wrong because what happened in the past whenever we had bad leaders well they got assassinated and really isn't it better to have a trial the assassination\nAnd we need to find some way of simply to keep violence out of this problem\nUm what's interesting about the the debates and sue is that I'm no one actually comments on Franklin's assertion that one gets the sense from reading Madison's James Madison's notes of their constitutional convention there was almost a dead pause where people look at Franklin and say\nOkay we're going to move on now because they're not entirely sure if they're if he's joking himself but he does make an important point either way which is that you want to find a legal way of doing these things so that the rule of law is always paramount you don't want an extra legal violent way of removing authority because that's ...\nOpen up the door for doing that again and again and again\nSo is it it's article ... section for the constitution what does that say\nWell if the president can removed or if he is guilty as you mentioned bribery\nTreason or high crimes and misdemeanors let me also stress it's actually not just the president of any high federal official I'm so judges for example we've heard a little bit of talk about perhaps and move against justice Cavanaugh a sport impeachment protecting is not going to go anywhere but it would be the constitutional remedy if you will\nIf people in Congress decided that new evidence came up to any federal official should be removed from from power\nAnd really the bribery is something that we need to understand that we typically understanding our own day I'm sort of courses treason\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors that that's the one that always gets everybody going in our day\nSo I actually we're going to make this a cliffhanger because I Want to make sure we have plenty of time to talk about this we're going to take a quick break now my guest is Jeffrey a angle founding director of the center for presidential history at Southern Methodist university\nHe's

informed citizens TCU lead on\nNixon was going to be impeached and I think it's very clearly he was going to be convicted at that he had read the writing on race so after um the Judiciary Committee half his articles of impeachment and sends them to the full house for a vote\nThat's when Nixon decides he wants to get out so that he can go down in history as a president who is not impeached officially we all know what's going on here but it's the the legal technicality\nShe's the president I think who really of all the three that we look at is the one who is in died in most for doing political harm to the country for hot dry\nFreshly during those high crimes exactly you know Johnson I think you could say was the victim of a bad policies but really the victim of politics um I have no sympathy for Johnson except for the fact that I think he did not actually commit a crime or a misdemeanor I'm no sympathy whatsoever\nNixon on the other hand I think did things which ultimately we think in retrospect there really is very few historians of any of that ever found\nIn the twenty first century who look back and say you know Nixon was innocent Nixon didn't do anything we all can debate Johnson and Clinton who I'm sure we'll talk about in a few moments but nobody debates the guilt of of Richard Nixon at this point but what's fascinating about that\nIs that he was not necessarily politically unpopular until the very very and in fact most Americans didn't we're not in favor of impeachment even Eighteen twenty months after the Watergate investigations have been going on\nIt was only after irrefutable evidence that period of the president's guilt by which I mean revelation of what we call the smoking gun audiotapes which are tapes that Richard Richard Nixon made of himself in the oval office\nAdmitting the crimes that he did was he was conversing with ... writing and saying very explicitly here's how we're going to get out of breaking the law um once Americans heard that it was all over and he has ... support collapses within a matter of days\nJust to think I'm Chris Boyd before that smoking gun tape Nixon had pretty successfully said this is the time\n[noise] yeah you know she she she really came up with something which we hear a lot of it you're simply wrote the play book if you will um he says it's a witch hunt\nA he says that this is a fishing expedition that basically they're just trying to find anything that they can pin on him his political enemies I remember of course the Democrats do control the Congress at this point so they have a great deal of investigative authority\nUm he also says that just has gone way too long that if there was something why can't you produce it we need the investigation to wrap up already it's distracting from the American people and basically tries every way possible to undermine the legitimacy of the investigation against him\nHe knows of course that he is guilty um with the truth the matter is he also thinks he can get away with it and I think you know if you ran that experiment again there was a series of events that occur that really set the ball rolling towards what we think of as inevitable impeachment and removed from office\nBut I think there's a very good chance that he could have politically survived at the ... a lawyer had made a different move a person had not\nConfessed to the tapes being available for example that he would have survived is by doing exactly what he suggested which was by trying to get the investigation to and prematurely and having the majority of his supporters believe it's an illegitimate investigations that didn't matter what conclusion was reached\nUm and that was helpful to Bill Clinton ultimately\n[noise] yes well you know Clinton I think is is that because he's a third case he again is the is the one who\nIs most clearly in my mind's a victim of opposition politics which is to say you know Johnson is a victim of politics but the majority and he was ... were were Republicans and he was actually elected though he was a Democrat on the Republican ticket a Clinton was clearly impeached and then tried by the opposition\nAnd very clearly Clinton was not tried or impeached for\nWill anything that I think a reasonable person ...\n... how the either a lot of people remember it as as Clinton being impeached for his affair with Monica Lewinski but that's not specifically what what got him\nAnd try and now he was impeached think he was a street and the specifically for lying to a grand jury over his previous relationship with Paula Jones and then subsequently over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky so he was essentially indicted for perjury if you will\nAnd perjury about is a fair so everyone in discussing the matter if you and I was sitting at a coffee shop in back in Nineteen Ninety nine we'll be saying to ourselves should a president be impeached for an affair\nBut legally he was impeached for lying to a grand jury about the affair which raises the question if you lie about where the nuclear missiles are or if you lie about how much you've stolen from the treasury that's pretty clearly a high crime\nIf you lie about trying to cover up infidelity\n[noise] most Americans are necessarily hurt by your infidelity no matter what you did your marriage is not necessarily about the nation is not a high crime and so really that's ultimately I think why Clinton is able to win acquittal in the Senate\nNot only for political reasons would just say the Democrats had enough votes as they held together to keep a super majority from occurring\nBut ultimately because they recognize that this was not a high crime and therefore they could but would their party instead of with their conscience\nClinton was and is a really masterful communicator how he managed to actually improve his approval rating throughout the\nDating against ... you know I I think uh a couple of things um first of all he tried very hard and they actually I like to say that Clinton actually ran three presidential campaigns are the first Ninety to the second section in the third to stay in office if you will and it really was an active presidential campaign trying to make public opinion\nEssentially believe that when you and I were having this discussion on a coffee shop\nOver whether or not the president should be impeached for having sex if we had that discussion\nThat exactly what he wanted she wanted people not to think about the illegality he wanted to people who nor the perjury right because because it doesn't affect the economy it doesn't affect national security it doesn't affect you know the the price of coffee in Topeka um it's about she's life and the laws he kept it focused on his life people could think he was a jerk and people did\nBut they also could think that he was a jerk who is being persecuted by his political enemies for moral reasons and for political reasons\nNot for actual impeachable reasons and he ultimately is very successful in getting people to focus\nOn those elements on who's enemies if you will\nBut also we have to remember the country's going pretty darn well at this time you know and he was doing exactly we this is our unit polar moment um this is my one of the United states is popular and and Clinton as popular around the world and he's a very appealing charismatic leader so consequently people look around and say well I'm not sure this was a high crime\nI think he's being unfairly persecuted and I liked the way the country's going why should we remove this guy\nAnd I guess is Jeffrey angle founding director of the center for presidential history at SMU and co author of a new book called impeachment and American history
