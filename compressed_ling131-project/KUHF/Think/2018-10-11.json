V. eight point six years of service of the University of Houston it's one o'clock\nI'm Chris boy I think lots of people worry that the administration is he was on foreign policy would create problems for America\nWe'll talk to an expert who says that hasn't happened Randall ... is editor in chief the journal purity setting and he says although the America First Trump Doctrine is a radical departure from the way his predecessors approached international affairs\nTrump's approach maybe just for the country needs given the new realities at the post Cold War world about how economic nationalism important terrorists and one to one deals instead of multilateral agreements might think that the U.S even if they are not good for our allies representation starts after a short break [noise]\n...\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... us stocks are lower again today after around yesterday the push the Dow industrial down more than eight hundred and thirty points as NPR's John Ydstie reports so far the losses are much smaller today\nThe Dow fell about a hundred and thirty points at the opening bell but a positive report on us consumer inflation help support the market which bounce back and forth between losses in games in early trading then some negative news from the White House on trade tensions with China pushed talk slower\nAt the morning session low the Dow is down over three hundred and Seventy points\nIt regain most background later investors are worried about trade issues and rising interest rates which are negative for stocks President Trump again criticized the fed for raising rates saying the fed is out of control and making a mistake John Ydstie NPR News Washington\nPresident Trump says results of an investigation into the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... may be released soon in the meantime as NPR's Ayesha Rascoe reports Trump is pushing back against calls from both parties in Congress for the U.S\nTo stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia Trump says the U.S will take action against Saudi Arabia is a term in that Saudis harm ... but he said he does not want to impose sanctions that will prevent the Saudi Government from buying US military equipment\nI don't like the concept of stopping and investment of a hundred and ten billion dollars into the United states\nBecause you know what they're going to do they're going to take that money to spend it or Russia or China or someplace else\nTrump said there are other ways to punish the Saudis though he didn't offer any examples Ayesha Rascoe NPR News the White House hundreds of thousands of\nHomes and businesses are without power in the southeast us today after hurricane Michael it came ashore along the Florida Panhandle just shy of a category five before weakening to a tropical storm over South Carolina North Carolina governor Roy Cooper says it's now in his state\nThe ragged but still raging remains of hurricane Michael have now come to North Carolina\nThe storm has already been done to lash our battered stay with strong winds and heavy rain\nThe media loves soaring rhetoric and just don't get that usually from from Trump the wings at a and there's a sense of him he ... he says what's on his mind he he's just nothing filtering his thoughts so I think he's incredibly transparent\nAnd I I don't think that's a bad thing I think he's a president that would be exactly who he is in private as he is in public and to me that's a good thing but too many people particularly I Would say like the the foreign policy establishment\nAnd the media this is just you know this is just he's he's a bullet in China shop he's just nothing like they've ever seen and um\nSo they just can't stand him and I I I think they they tend to misinterpret everything he says I'm\nYou know ... I'm not saying he he he walks into it lots of times but I I just don't like you know I was just listening to NPR\nAs before I got here and I'm listening to Max Boot excoriated Republicans and people who voted for\nTrump is they're all race is that the you know the the Hillary Clinton they're deplorable and um I I just think that's such a missed mischaracterization of the people who support Trump and Trump himself I don't I don't think he said all\nRacist but I think he's a man of his time you know he he he's he's not politically correct\n[noise] you know that President Trump discontinued the Obama era policy of avoiding large scale conventional more in the middle east but where Obama was criticized by many people for allowing Syria to sort of cross that red line into chemical weapons President Trump did launched an air strike in retaliation for ... use of those weapons on civilians\nCan we say the Trump's actions will keep aside from the plane chemical weapons in the future\n[noise] no I you know I I think that's going too far um I that was a strange rather uncharacteristic it it's not a very\nRealistic response I Will say that but [noise] um because real is would say you know it it it was about human rights now having said that the United states an enormously\nPowerful country and so you know we can do all kinds of things that other countries can't dream of life project power and I think that this was a case where Trump's all these children dying of nerve gas and it was appalling and he said well if we can go in there and and and\nYou know a launch an attack and and uh won't cost us very much we have the military out there and then let's do it and teach them a lesson\nI'm willing to do it again I don't know he's very unpredictable leader us us out so I Can't say but I think if he does it again he'll probably get the same treatment maybe a little worse than next on\nWhat is the ... don't push ISIS mostly out of Syria and Iraq\n[noise] who you know lots of things but uh [noise] they let the generals do more\nUm up front you know they they gave them more power to do things on the ground or it's a complicated story I I Would pretend to know all the details of how they did it but I just think Trump deserves credit for the fact that\nISIS has been almost annihilate you know they are they still they're still around there on the Internet and things like that but for the most part ISIS is gone and again I I don't hear anyone\nYou know there's occasional talk about what a good thing that is but I don't hear it on places like CNN or MSNBC and I think most Americans are quite grateful that\nISIS is gone and I I'm not going to say the Trump is you know entirely responsible for that but he he certainly deserves some credit for that\nWell I think there and I'm not an expert in this part of the world but there are people who would argue that it ... it wasn't like a unilateral us effort to push ISIS out ... the U.S is not on the ground in Syria there are a lot of other\nUm there are a lot of other entities fighting ISIS and and that sounds like the kind of international effort that you're saying maybe isn't a great idea or isn't necessary in a in a realist political world there\nWell I I think it's a good outcome and like I say the United states has a extremely safe country I mean we are extremely sick or secure maybe the world's most ... we are the world's most secure state\nThe world has never seen a state more secure than we are so we can do things like get rid of ISIS that said I don't think that we should expend enormous amounts of blood and treasure to do so I'm In fact in the middle east I I really would think and I would hope that\nThe U.S tries to get out of the middle east there's just nothing in it for us anymore and one of the good things Trump is done like Obama is\nAvoid large scale war in the middle east so whereas I'm happy that ISIS is gone I don't think I was a great threat to United States it was a very bad annoyance\nUm but that's about it so the fact that we could get rid of ISIS and they wouldn't cost us a you\nKnow we didn't need a large scale invasion to do it that's a very good\n[noise] so you know President Trump has rejected many of the kind of foundational ideals of the liberal international order that his govern geopolitics really since the end of the second World War what kinds of activities would you say the U.S has taken on as a responsibility in the past as obligations\nWithout consideration to how much it would cost us domestically\nWell the middle east I mean I have to do is think about what we've done in the middle east and what is it really gotten us very little of anything but I think this whole idea of ... that we engage in a social engineering sort of on a global scale with the rest of the world is higher\nInterventionist foreign policy that was endorsed by both the left and the right whether it was liberal engage or is or or a neo conservatives on the right\nUm you know tried to make the world you know democratic promoting democracy you know this whole thing in the middle East that Bush started where he we we were going to democratize the middle east\nAre these grandiose plan somehow you know a few guns mock a few heads and will somehow have a demo democratize Middle East I'm\nJust I'm I Would say like our foreign policy has just been mismanaged for two decades criminally\nSo uh by the foreign policy establishing whether it's you know what we did in Bosnia what we did in um [noise]\nUh Iraq Iraq Afghanistan Libya and you can even go back as far as the Vietnam War about just you know that's that's going back a ways but you know the the foreign policy establishes done a lot of crazy\nThings that have done

[noise]\nI just feel like you know he says he gauges and racist comments were what in particular did he say that you think is racist um you know\nI think a lot of people have seen the president's responses to 'em pretty significant uh situations I'm ... and has he has seemed as if he was not particularly concerned about uh attacks on on people you know black lives matter demonstrators that sort of thing\nUm I I just disagree I Know I don't see that at all in fact now I I I I think um\nI also think forgive me I I'm a white person and I you know typically if a person of color says something is racist I tend to\nBelieve them when you know I I don't think that that's a reason to believe someone but you know I I don't think\nThe color of a person's skin a is a determining whether there are truths say or not because I think that people of the same color skin will disagree I'm On\nWhat they see and hear 'em I think what Trump does is like I say he is not\nHe's not um self aware of how his remarks can be interpreted and and what we see is a very generous interpretations of what he's saying\nUm and then we could just go through every remark I mean you have to go through each individual case and I will show you what I think he is saying when I'm confident that he's saying and it's not racist but this is you know people want to believe is racist you know\nThey've been calling Republicans racist for decades and decades decades I I just have to disagree with that\nMy guess is Randall ... he is professor of political science and director of the program for realist foreign policy at Ohio State University You're listening to think I'm crystal and [noise]\nI don't want to talk a little bit about a trade deals ... what was once called NAFTA has been replaced by an agreement now known as the United states Mexico Canada agreeing that it was negotiated between the U.S and each other partners separately what's the advantage the U. S. pursuing bilateral trade and security deals rather than multinational partnerships\nAre multi ... as I said earlier you if you um see multilateral Islam multilateral deals are designed to place limits on their returns to power in\nA sense that's one of them by that what I mean is that you have it's much\nHarder for the U.S to use its bargaining leverage in bargaining power in a multilateral setting [noise] um\nSo you know\nThe Trump was pointing out when he was doing renegotiating NAFTA Mexico is a very different country from Canada and so it makes a lot more sense to negotiate with them individually than it does collectively\nUm some observers have worried and you address this in the piece that President Trump is looking to dismantle NATO first of all do you think that that's true have you seen indications that that is\nThe case she wants to those areas instincts but he can't he he has hired people that are more foreign policy establishment type like Rex Tillerson and then I think my my palm patio and\nMadison certainly John Bolton and um I don't think these people actually they're not radical and their views on foreign policy is way Trump is\nTrump's instincts are and I think they are correct that NATO is obsolete\nBut he he's not going to be able to dismantle NATO though I I Will say a people of that I respect greatly\nUh out right after the Cold War back in Nineteen Ninety One said that maybe NATO's days aren't number but it's years are so this is not something that is radical from the perspective of let's say real is very famous real is Ken and I'm a chemist waltz I'm\nVery very respected real said that NATO did see the point about alliances that their their greatest enemy of an alliance of success once you defeat the enemy the alliance is supposed to break up but NATO has not broken up\nAnd you know that the question is who is NATO what is it what is the target of NATO and some would respond well made it was designed to um keep America in ... Germany down and keep the Russians out maybe it's still doing the same thing I don't know\nDo you think Americans who have concerns about the president's apparently college all relations have vitamin ... and with Russia um are are worried about nothing should should we be concerned that that Russia could pose a a military or an economic or a geopolitical threat to the United states\nRussia cannot pose an economic or military threat to United States and\nYou know we have a lot that we can do in concert with the Russians but our relationship is right now and ... off the rails and I\nAgain I think Trump's instincts are correct that there's you know we don't have to love them you're pointing to recognize that we have an interesting comment and we should try to\nBe on good terms with them the Russians and I honestly I think um Russia has been misunderstood and in many ways I'm not saying that", "show_name": "Think", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "11"}
