has told himself a version of this story where he is the victim in this and that and and told me as much you know and I write about this a little in the other side because so I got away and he got away there was a a little bit of time during which I was working with\nLaw enforcement carrying the United states to try to lure him back into the country and so I ended up corresponding with him for a little while\nAnd and during that correspondence he made clear that I had misunderstood what had happened to me well\nThat I had misunderstood the kidnapping um that I had misunderstood the rapes that I had misunderstood his intention to kill me\nAs really just an expression of his extreme devotion to me and how he in fact was a victim um in all of this uh and he was a victim of my of his love for me um and so if he thinks about me at all I'm\nSure he thinks about it in that context or has told himself a version of the story in which he is my victim rather than the other way around I think I Would find that unbearable um I guess the point is you don't have a choice but to bury right [noise]\nRight [noise] um I think that a lot of times when we think about another person's experience and imagine it being unbearable um ... you know it\nI don't know what else what what not being able to bear it looks like near as my will to survive was stronger\nThan my um my desire to give up [laughter] or to or to feel pain [noise] um that that my um determination to live past this was was stronger than my capacity for pain I think\nBut I Want to be clear because there's no doubt on your mind that what happened to you when you were Twenty one what was done to you it it changed you forever you're you have no illusions about that\nNo not at all uh I and I think um [noise] and it changed me in different kinds of ways so\nYou know at first and and still I continue to have an in capacity for\nRecklessness [laughter] you know in um to to be spontaneous um I I don't like being surprised even sometimes when it's a good surprise I don't I'm not very capable of being adventurous or doing things on the spur of the moment\nI'm In in the way that I was before you know before all this happened I was um you know before I met him I was you know oh a wild girl you know and in ways that may have a\nYou know I'm I may have made some poor choices that got me into that relationship and the first place but I'm finding now myself\nLet's see Eighteen years after that experience I Am a stronger person now than I was before I'm capable of doing things now that I wasn't capable of doing the for having survived this and having carried\nThis pain with me all these years has made me I'm a has shown me a potential that I may not have discovered if it hadn't happened so there are ways in which it has changed me\nIn ways that I regret but also in ways that I Would refuse to give back when you say that you do wish for a reckoning what does that mean to you\nI think it means a couple of things um I Want\nHim to hear from me the pain that he cause I I Want him to to\nNot only hear it um you know the full tale of it these are all the ways um that you harmed me\nI'm not just even um you know the kidnapping and rape and an an attempted murder which was um by far the most acute and most um [noise] you know spectacular and the way that things are spectacles but wasn't the first\nTime he harm to me and and may not have even been the worst way that he harmed me you know I write in the ... about how I think the most enduring harm that he caused was\nChanging the story that I told myself about the person I could be on that that was the worst violence that he committed against me [noise]\nUm and so to to to be able to tell him all of that is I think the first part\nAnd the second part is that he reflects that back to me and takes ownership of that harm to say yes I did these things to you and to not only admit that to me but that to to admitted in public um so that it's\nNot um something where my testimony or my witness could be called into account that everyone is fair to bear witness\nTo that to to what I say I'm as being true and being valid and that he validates that experience back to me and then um the third part and\nI'm not necessarily for him to suffer or to be punished which is not um I sort of I'm not intending to give up my right to you know pursue legal action against him\nBut that he um he spent his life in service to other people's joy [laughter] you know she took so much joy and capacity for joy out of my life\nI think it would be justice for him to spend the rest of his life putting it back in\nMy guest is writer Lacey Johnson her new collection of essays is called the reckoning that explores the complexities of trauma injustice and mercy\nIf
