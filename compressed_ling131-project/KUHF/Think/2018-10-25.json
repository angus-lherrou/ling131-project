V. eight point six years of service of the University of Houston\nLive from NPR News in Washington on Lakshmi sang federal investigators are searching for the person or persons behind at least ten suspicious packages addressed to several of President Trump's critics NPR's Quil Lawrence has an update\nPresident Trump called for calm at a White House event and a political rally after news of the apparent bombs broke but today the president and his press secretary blamed the mainstream media for fomenting anger by reporting negatively about the president\nThe suspicious packages of all targeted Democrats and critics of the president many of whom are the subject of right wing conspiracies\nThe addresses include former CIA chief John Brennan former attorney general Eric Holder Hillary Clinton Brock Obama and now former vice president Joe Biden an actor Robert Deniro\nAuthorities say the packages are linked and some contain bomb like devices they were all intercepted before reaching the intended recipients and no one has been injured so far Quil Lawrence NPR News New York\nMore than two thousand members of the national guard are already deployed at the U.S Mexico border NPR's Tom Bowman says at the department of homeland security is now requesting hundreds more American troops as a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants travels north through Mexico to the United states\nPresident Trump already has said he's worried about this caravan heading toward the United states and he wanted to send a lot more troops down there so this is what we're seeing now again the department of homeland security has made the request to the Pentagon for hundreds more troops\nAnd defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign that today sending about eight hundred army troops down to the border\nThat's NPR's Tom Bowman reporting to Republican led house committees are considering today's testimony from George Papadopoulos the former Trump campaign adviser who helped kick start the special counsel probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion\nIs meeting was close to the public it was among several interviews of the judiciary and oversight and Government Reform panels are conducting in their probe into allegations of partisan bias at the department of justice\nThis year's winner of the Nobel Peace prize not him a rod is in Paris to appeal for justice for the ... people Here's NPR's Eleanor Beardsley\n... told journalists it isn't easy for survivors of ISIS crimes to speak out but they are hoping their testimony will help bring justice Murat who wasn't slave by ISIS shared the Nobel Peace prize this year\nIt's about a group of about eight or nine men who had the singular experience and they alone had it in the whole of American history of\nWaging major wars and sending large number of ... numbers of Americans off to die and they have some things in common a lot of them have\nEmotional breakdowns LBJ as a great example of that you know I use these tapes of his\nTo get into his head you know the secret tapes he made his private conversations which I did two books on uh some time ago on Nineteen sixty four and sixty five but these covered the later years which I have not covered before\nAnd he gets more suspicious and he gets more angry and it gets more wound up Woodrow Wilson had a stroke they also physical breakdowns Franklin Roosevelt had progressive\nCardiovascular disease so that's one thing they all become with almost no exception more religious even Abraham Lincoln who was a young man was considered to be almost an atheist when he's a war president one of his old friends comes to see him and says I'm so shocked to see reading the Bible\nAnd Lincoln says you know I Can't imagine that anyone would not become more religious going through this experience Lady Bird Johnson told me that\nLate in the Vietnam War she thought her husband Lyndon was going to become a Catholic because their daughter Lucy who converted to Catholicism at the age of sixteen took her dad to Catholic Mass and he found such comfort with the men whom Lucy called my little amongst down at the church that you'd like to go to\nSo another thing is that you really find religion becoming very important in the lives of some of these war presidents where it had not been at all\nDid James Cape poll find religion because it seems like he was he was ...\nHe only did at the very end he got himself baptized almost on his deathbed but I Wish it had more religion because I think he was a very bad man he did some good things he ensure the Texas is what it is today which I'm all for your oh four\nBut he did a terrible thing he was a liar and it was a scoundrel and he was a bully and\nA newly and the presidency he contrived a border incident that anyone in who knows Texas history will know at least some version of so that Mexicans would come across the river and attack Americans in a very small way\nAnd poked did this deliberately had sent Zachary Taylor soldiers down they're hoping that this would happen so that he could go to Congress which he did and say we need an immense war against Mexico all the way down to Mexico City which he knew would take a very long time\nAnd he said his purpose was to retaliate for what the Mexicans have done to us in this incident and also if isn't that we prevent that we performed so this is the first case of something we regrettably I write a lot about in this book these fake incidents the president's either stage or exploit\nThat stampede Americans to get into war is that they otherwise would not support\nBut pokes ulterior motive which he did not tell anyone didn't even tell a secretary of state but it's all in his diary was he wanted to have a war with Mexico so that he could get under very favorable terms nearly a million square miles of\nTerritory from Texas up from Mexico incorporated into the United states so that we would become continental nation from Atlantic Pacific very worthy aim but he didn't have to do it like a semi criminal\nHow could you have done it without a without starting a major war\nHe could have negotiated with the Mexicans are offered a large price for it that's the way it's usually done uh and as I say this was a case of ends versus means I Love the and I love the fact the taxes are secure I was just in California I'm Glad as part of the United states\nBut the whole dream of the founders and Seventeen Ninety seven was that we would do things the right way honestly as straightforwardly and poke was really a cheat from beginning to end\nUm there have always been people who saw through these defections 'em when they have a current why didn't anybody why wasn't anybody able to stand at the park and say we're not going to do that\nIt was something that you've seen as a theme all through American history which is that once American Soldiers are engaged and there's a natural feeling among Americans you want to support the troops it's very hard for someone to get up and say we should stop this they're not there for the ride struggle\nAnd my view is that true American history\nThe protesters have had a very important role that also was seen by the founders you know you go back to the monarchies of Europe\nThere weren't any protesters when there were war's declared because these were absolute monarchies the founders felt that in our society there's a place for those who are protesting against the war the way of wars fought for instance because that makes presidents and congresses they have a little bit more wisely\nBut there were some people who oppose the ... the Mexican war in late Eighteen forty seven there was a young congressman who\nRose on the floor of the house and he said basically I think this incident of pokes that causes war was a fake you show me the spot he said\nThat the Mexicans attack I'll bet you can't find it and the congressman who was so brave in opposing post war was none other than Abraham Lincoln in Illinois\nDid his experiences opposing poking doubting what had happened shaped away Lincoln decided to deal with the secession various states\nVery much so because Lincoln was an idealist but at the same time he was a very tough guy\nAnd for instance as he began to fight his word wages were against the secessionist\nHe was not going to do this with one hand tied behind his back he suspended habeas corpus he did other things that lead people have the time to say that he was trying to be a tyrant or a dictator himself and I think that was not wrong he was doing things that even went outside the constitution\nWrong thing but remember I was talking about ends versus means he felt it was necessary to win the war and in his defense I Would say two things number one lake and kept on saying whatever I'm doing that seems questionable my word is but that's what he was trying to say\nI Want it known to all future presidents that I'm not intended to set a precedent that some later president in a much less challenging situation\nCan use and the other thing is that I looked all through Lincoln's life and particularly what he did and said during his presidency I Can't find any evidence that he did this out of lust for power there are other presidents in American history who have\nCut corners and broken laws I think to become a more powerful person\nMy guest is historian and author Michael Beschloss we're talking about his new book presidents of war the ethics story from Eighteen oh seven to modern times\nIt's going to join us we have

grab opportunities I Want to talk a little bit of outlay and McKinley um how in the world did to us for a time really become a true colonial power under McCain like well\nThat's the thing of you know ends versus means if you like the fact that we're a world power you know let's put a flower in front of the portrait of William McKinley but he did it in a terrible way because\nUh Eighteen Ninety eight we had a ship not for a large ship called the main the main was in Havana Harbor and the main yeah the uh the ship was sunk and everyone said remember the Maine and tabloids in New York We're saying these Spanish to sank our ship this is a terrible thing\nSo Congress exceeded to William McKinley is request to go to war with Spain only one little problem Chris of the ship was sunk actually by a boiler accident I guess you couldn't go to war against boilers to Ninety eight\nSo Americans were brought up and furious against Spain and we have to avenge the sinking of the ship so we conquered the Philippines and we did the same with ... we did the same thing with Puerto Rico and we liberated Cuba from really nasty Spanish tyranny that was a good deed\nBut the point is that was sort of like poke with the border incident\nWe went through this large war based on a fake incident that never existed you know terrible for our democracy\nLessons here about how easy it is to spin the American public up into support for wars that are not justify at all in the long term\nAnd the danger here is that one day it may lead and unscrupulous president to stage a fake incident of his own in order to get Americans to back a war that otherwise they would not support\nA Nineteen sixty four you know another example of a variation of this was the Gulf of Tonkin incident\nLBJ was dealing with reports he had of an incident firing on American ship in the Gulf of talking and he went on television said there's been an incident an unprovoked attack\nAgainst the American ship while he knew what the time but if there was an attack it was not unprovoked because we were doing all sorts of things to talk of the north Vietnamese and little boats that were there\nAnd so he went to Congress got this Gulf of Tonkin resolution almost unanimous for the next almost a decade he and Richard Nixon wage this war almost sixty thousand Americans dead based on this flimsy Gulf of Tonkin resolution\nAnd appointing a thing as a privately Johnson found out within a few weeks that there had never been any incident after all the report had been false so basically that whole war was waged on the basis of a resolution passed on uh in in retaliation for an incident that didn't happen\nTo think I'm Chris Boyd\nThis program is part of the Texas Station collaborative a consortium of public
