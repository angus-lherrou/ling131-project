[noise]\nSo it's it would be hard to overestimate the effect it had on you when you realize that you were undocumented you um as you describe in the book you wanted to start driving like every teenager you snuck your green card on your grandfather's filing cabinet went to apply for a learners permit\nWhat happened when you got to the DMZ [noise]\nWell I didn't think anything was to happen I thought I'd show my green card and I show my Mountain View highschool ID and you know I was listening to a lot of more set and voice to men in my walkman today and I'd get out done so seriously just let it out but that's what I thought [laughter]\nAnd then the woman's a DMV when she looked at my green card she flip the twice maybe less than ten seconds and she lowered herself into booth and she looked at me and said this is fake\nDon't come back here again [laughter] [noise] so in many ways she was actually the very first person to like save me right because she could've reported me she said don't come back here again but here's the thing the moment she said that I immediately deep in my mind the thing that first came to my mind was I'm not Mexican\nHow you're going to be documented right yeah\nBecause in this country at sixteen years old in Nineteen Ninety seven whenever the newspaper or the radio show or the television news said anything about anyone who has big papers or someone\nLegally it was always about Mexican people\nAnd because my name is will say I thought maybe she thought it was Mexican so isn't that horrible that I actually took that in and I believe that\nYou know I'm happy to see you now you know your your listeners are in Texas um I think we owe the Mexican people in this country a tremendous apology\nHow we have completely racialized this issue and pointed our fingers by the way what thirty three million Mexicans in the United states many of whom were been here before\nThe United states of America and yet this issue has been synonymous with them and I wonder what happens when you're young Mexican kid in any classroom in America especially in a state like Texas and you have a teacher or you have a classmate and they talk about what about illegal people out of a sudden you start thinking that they're talking about you\nHow horrible a stat and then\nIn fact you know that that today the largest growing fastest growing group of undocumented people in this country are Asian people\nAre from Asia Koreans Indians Chinese Filipinos and yet you know I\nAs you know in the book there's a whole chapter called the master narrative yeah which I wrote kind of um as as as a way of a way of gratitude to Toni Morrison who has\nSignificantly impacted the way I think of the country in the way I think about myself but the master narrative of immigration in this country specifically illegal immigration is all wrong and we and the news media specifically have a really big role to play as to why it's wrong [noise]\nMy guess is journalist so say I'm telling you about I guess he is founder and CEO of the nonprofit define American and author of the memoir deer America notes at an undocumented citizen\nIf you'd like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email stink at K.

S. citizen box and unemployment forms which is something that by lawyers probably don't want me talking to you about right now [laughter] [noise]\nBut if we're going to tell the truth about the issue I have to be honest about that I live in the government forms I broke the law when I was Nineteen years old when I first did it knowingly and I remember looking at the forum and it said perjury on it if you lie\nYou know I didn't have an iPhone I couldn't just like Google perjury but I knew that it was bad but I checked the box I wanted to work I wanted to pay taxes which we do I wanted to make sure that I could make a living from my cells\nRight so that's the third option to fourth option which is not an option in many ways but it is a choice which is to leave I can just leave\nAnd I actually think this is a really important points mix so as I mentioned one point eight million undocumented people in the state of Texas millions more if you count the u._s. citizens to live within documents with people\nIs an incredible did every day we're still get up to go to work driving places we're not supposed to drive and dropped it gets off to school right and provide for families is not a miracle that even at a time like this when the president talks about us like we're insect office box right that we still\nGet on every day see I find that I find it miraculous and I would argue that that's the miracle of what America does to you it dares you write and America is like one big dare\n\nYou told a friend that you didn't meet the kind of white people who would put you in your place until you moved to Washington DC and there's just so much wrapped up in that statement I'm\nA ... a lot of\nWhat was different in DC and did it take you by surprise like oh there are lots of white people who are just going to dislike me because I'm a ...\nHeard it was you know it's so interesting because like you know I grew up in Mountain View California right like we're we're Google in Silicon valley is and whenever when I got older whenever like you know for example my first film premiered at the Tribeca Film festival and two thousand ten before I came out and documented and in the film\nCivil my high school principal my superintendent the principles I'm second like everyone from my high school came to the film festival and my friends were like\nWho are all those white people [laughter] and I'm like well during my high school family you know and they flew all the way from California to New York just to be with me and my friends were always shock especially my friends where people of color always shock like\nYou were raised you were like mentored by those people and I guess I was but when I was growing up it was\nThey didn't see me as someone to be saved I wasn't someone to become to send it to I wasn't someone to be explained I wasn't a problem to them you know I was just a kid that they just wanted to help out\nThere was something incredibly just pure about that\nBut you know I didn't know any better so I didn't know I didn't I didn't even really know that they were white I mean some people the white I mean yeah Julie Roberts is white you know I'm On hold Trump to slight yeah there's that but for me it's more about how people make you feel\nSo it wasn't until I moved to DC surrounded by a bunch of white people ... and ... and ... many who doubted why are you in this room [laughter]\nHow did you get this job oh you you went to a state school\nOr bad right over the Washington Post you I mean you could swing you're you're a person I had somebody went to an Ivy League school no fest Ivy League schools are wonderful right but I didn't go to one and so people wonder like why how did this to get here [noise]\nAnd more often than not there were
