we have and we need to know about his um you know he didn't separate his businesses\nOf himself from his businesses when he became president we just need to know that because the suspicions that this

a post demand credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two and had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin\nNow there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting them like seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me for so many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails it's I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nAnd tell me about some of the places where these libraries and our tuition with the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up this sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them um in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and the king while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nOf course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love it\nOf if I've got a book and I really loved it sometimes going and sticking it in there and that all you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of this idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little libraries big heroes

Trump might have said that [noise]\nJuanita broader speaking right before walking into the presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nThat Susan Glasser the read on that was Trump was willing out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work\nWell I think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and raising it out\nAnd denying or telling the truth slowly you know Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself against that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the case throughout\nThe subsequent me to revelations which took place after that twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included\nBelieve that part of that sort of national furor over the meat you stories has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly accused of misconduct by numerous women in Trump's case I Believe it's Nineteen women\nDo you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky scandal if it unfolded today\nYou know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted publicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about members in their own ranks\nWho are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandoned Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota you know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does that leave us or is it time to\nLet it go well I Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clintons at every turn suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time\nYou know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated this issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep recurring is largely a reflection of the fact that we're grappling as a country with the unique\nPresidents have Donald Trump and the many allegations of wrongdoing towards him [noise]\nSusan Glasser now a columnist at the New Yorker thanks so much\nThank you [noise] ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News

P. D. through a federal court order is justified really as an insult to the farm\nAre specialists are changing she wasn't able to get prescriptions that she was totally able to get before suddenly they weren't covered there was more who suddenly to jump through and then I think like the fourth year we started to notice that that providers are pulling out of the marketplace every year they just started dropping like\nFlies by twenty Seventeen Maricopa County where body lives with down to just one health insurer innocent tire marketplace [noise]\nOkay at this point in our conversation school let out and kids start spilling into the street in front of us body way and that Sophia which one is she\nShe is she's coming in actuality\nI fear okay this is now a ... ten year old with a huge smile gliding home and I think scooter I really hate lock\nFly wise walking so bad it's it has hurt spy legs\nBut riding a scooter could be really risky now because remember how Maricopa County\nHad only one insurer left on its exchange\nWill turns out the hospital they had always treated Soviet terminated its contract with that one ensure and Bobby decided staying with those doctors was important to she cancelled the families plan under the a CNA which means the bodies don't have any health insurance right now\nWhile I'm thinking what happens when some emergency happened right with severe exactly so really know what what is your\nWhat is that right now it literally what I say okay we'll cross that bridge if they come to it like I don't have a backup plan right now\nI don't feel it's terrifying it's absolutely terrifying\nBobby's hoping this will be temporary she will have more options for coverage during the next open enrollment period in November\nBut when she thinks about how hopeful she was when Democrats ruled out the a CIA she says but she didn't see at the time we're all the puck marks underneath the make up when you hear Democrats cheering about it a plotting themselves are passing it is there is something a little bit impatient that well inside it\nI think in patients is an excellent way to describe it I'm like a it's an impatient because I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting\nWaiting for what for some sort of change some sort of champion maybe some ... some things would be amazing grin Bobby says she doesn't know exactly what that fix should be but she knows she wants to see Republicans and Democrats working together to come up with some compromise\nAnd she says this is the single\nMost important issue for her in this entire mid term election\nAnd for more on how health care is playing out in Arizona as races we're now joined by kj ... Will Stone who covers health care there Well hi Elsa so you know we see a lot of issue ads about health care throughout the state including one that ... gene started\nBut what candidates actually saying about health care\nOn the campaign trail Democrats are certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care and another referendum on the Affordable CARE Act that voters can expect a GOP to do what they tried to do last year or repeal the healthcare law\nI'm In this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call more defensive posture\nUh it's very much on display in our tight Senate race between Democrats have been the defense of ones for the past eight years but you think it's Republicans now that is seems to be what's happening right now I mean if you just look at the race between Democrat gears didn't cinema\nUm she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent Martha mix Sally and you know in response from ... how to kind of soften moderate her stance on the issue saying we cannot go back to where we were before the CIA that we need to fix the law and protect people with preexisting conditions\nAnd so for me I think it shows the to win a statewide race in Arizona which before the AC I had one of the highest rates in the country Republicans like makes our need to reassure voters\nThat they support certain key provisions of the healthcare law and not just a full repeal so you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in the states not so much and you can see that you know in the political races and a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid\nArizona expanded Medicaid under the ace EA and we had a lot of people who needed coverage\nSo there was a big rush joined the program\nThat was at risk under the ... bill and people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program a Republican moderates like the program it functions well\nSo no one wanted to see that a damaged or cut\nAnd as for those who shop for insurance plans on the marketplace they say they want more options cheaper plans lord a duck to bowls but they do not want to see a full overhaul yeah on on more options you know we heard current Bobby said that she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month\nWhat does it look like I mean it looked like there will be more options for the state it's looking remarkably better of the market has stabilized arts rebounded health experts I talked to said will be more options and it's really one of the more resilient are examples in the country or the marketplaces working that kj these Will Stone thank you very much well thank you [noise]\n\nThis is Elsa Chang from NPR News

were apparently able to push their way through a Guatemalan border fence if I were both Mexican authorities calls for an orderly migration and US President Donald Trump's threats of retaliation but

Wisconsin\nUm these are states where Trump made a lot of games and the Democrats are cutting bouncing back Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio is way ahead as a Democrat I'm Richard Cordray the Democrat running for governor is it a very tight race a Democrats are doing quite well in Wisconsin and Michigan I think\nOn election night we're really going to learn a lot about how strong Trump's whole is on these key states if those states goes south\nOn Trump or the whole operation is in a grave trouble and the Democrats are short doing better uh this year than people would have predicted two days after the twenty sixteen election\nMargaret would you agree with that Democrats are doing a lot better than might have been predicted\n... well\nThey are doing very well and it is likely that they'll take back the house of representatives you look at every single poll right now ah but\nYou know we don't get the generic out the generic ballot average as Democrats leading Republicans by you know the low end eight percent to the high end fourteen percent\nSo that is at\nNot historically a surprise uh it is typical for the president any new president to lose seats in the house of representatives and after that first at election cycle but they'd proportion and the extent may actually end up being historic\n... let me turn each would totally different topic ah the case of ... ... this is of course the missing\nLikely murdered Saudi journalist a President Trump just this afternoon said for the first time he's open to considering sanctions against Saudi Arabia if it turns out that they were behind this but he continues to stress Saudi Arabia is a great ally of the U.S that we need to wait for an investigation which he says we may know more about by Monday\nMargaret why the reluctance to call out the Saudis\n\nYou know Donald Trump wants to have it both ways right he he wants to be able to put his arm around ... and say wouldn't it be great if we can all just get along with Russia they have no incentive to intervene in our election and then he also wants to be a tough guy on the world stage\nAnd ... ... ... ... ... it's a it's very difficult to understand the reasoning or that the rhyme or reason behind\nThis other than what's on the faces this was his first diplomatic play as a president in the United states has first international trip or a wide range of Saudi Arabia and he put his arms around Mohammed bin ...\nAt this is at\nFrankly it was encouraging I think to the secretary ammunition pull out of the Saudi Arabian bath in conference the treasury secretary who was also have to go to Saudi Arabia right ... and and but then again you've got these mixed messages on the Trump Administration are yeah secretary ...\nGoing to Saudi Arabia and hang out we're going to need more time what we really look too and hope for and I'm hopeful though so the Republican leadership in Congress also\nReinforcing this idea that a Saudi Arabia must not be allowed to get away with murder and American resident and a journalist\nA full\nFull ... alright EJ jump on that first up and I want to ask you about something that the Washington Post your newspaper

the great ... you know Soviet the Soviet ... up I'm hauling and do anything you have to do on behalf of Donald Trump it ... the post ran his last stop ed written before he was killed\nA and it was a defensive free speech it sounded almost red white and blue and how much it talked about the importance of freedom many appears to have died ah died for this cause\nI think all of this in terms of Trump or raises a question about the transparency of Trump and his business dealings there were so many questions though out there not only about\nBeing invested in the Saudis in policy terms which clearly is about what kind of business dealings we have and we need to know about his um you know he didn't separate his businesses\nOf himself from his businesses when he became president we just need to know that because the suspicions that this might if his views on this might be influenced in any way by this this this is terrible for him and it's really terrible for the country\nAnd we
