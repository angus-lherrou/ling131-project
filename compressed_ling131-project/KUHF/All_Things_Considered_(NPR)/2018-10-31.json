Presley had spent more than a decade working in politics as an aide to lawmakers like Senator John Kerry before she decided she should be the candidate\nI've certainly been a toiling in the Democratic politics working hard to elect Democrats and the comment while then throughout our country and so for people to tell me that I should wait my turn a my mother did not raise me to ask permission to leave and so I raised my hand\nI spoke to her about some of the optical she face when she decided to run for Congress\nWhat did trouble me and hurt me was that I was ... by the charges of identity politics throughout my campaign\nAnd it was just sort of um an assumption that my message was not appealing to or that my work had not been to the benefit of\nA broad and diverse coalition of many people and that was hurtful because that is a a play out of the G O P handbook\nNot a charge that would have expected to be lobbied against me by Democrats and certainly not people that consider themselves to be progressive\nI Want to jump in here because I'm their democratic groups that did not necessarily endorse your campaign right um the Congressional Black caucus a pack also emily's list\nUm you had people like Deval Patrick a former governor you had John Lewis I'm of Georgia that civil rights legend who all came down for your opponent capital into what kind of message\nDoes that send to you\nWell first and foremost I'm no Neal fight to this and I knew what I was getting into there's usually a de fall to incumbency I did not expect that I Would have the support of the establishment locally or nationally I knew this would be lonely I knew it would be up hill I knew that it would be bruising\nYou mentioned the idea of having to go up against incumbents right and a democratic establishment what are some of the obstacles that people who are newer to politics are going to face especially as black women are there other kinds of aspects to running that they ... they may be locked out of either by tradition or through other factors\nWell listen I was told everything from I shouldn't be wearing my hair and twists I shouldn't wear hoops I shouldn't be as transparent

into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office I left school\nNot because I didn't know the value of an education but because my mother got sick and she lost her job and I was her caregiver in battling that pre existing condition of leukemia which ultimately took her life\nThat is a story that millions of Americans can relate to\nAnd we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people is because people are not at the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia right if I Need to become the first black female governor there's Linda Coleman running for Congress in North Carolina why now it's been many many years where there haven't been that many women of color running what do you think is different\nWell to be clear even though we have an ad that leadership parity and gender and race black woman had been leading in faith communities and social racial gender and economic justice movements we've been on the frontline we've proven that our boats matter\nThat our voices matter\nAnd now we're proving that our leadership matter the polls that as down my Thirteen points and we won by Seventeen\nBecause we expanded the

gone to the site in Texas and Florida Puerto Rico and has tried to represent the country and the country's\nEmbrace of these victims at times this worked at other times it's been quite awkward particularly in Puerto Rico and then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in twenty Seventeen equating or some people felt he was drawing up on a quibble it's between some of the people who came to\nTo rally as white supremacist as white nationalist his Nazis and the people who came to protest that route\nI think the blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it either\nDo you think this way that Trump reacts in times of tragedy do think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react or is he just somebody who's uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic controller\nIn fairness a public shows of empathy or not President Trump's strong suit he he did not promised that sort of a presidency when he ran\nLet's face it he has a great talent for bonding with rally audiences and it's just less comfortable for him to acknowledge the powerful details of a tragedy such as Pittsburgh and far less comfortable for him to you to critics who urge him toward introspection\nBut should president be judged if they're not good at consoling the country in times of tragedy\nNo president should be judged solely on that one particular part of his role that he has least control of book there are going to be those people who are going to feel that the president should be able

said Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races billions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money project study total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during this entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion how some compare\nTo previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's at thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now TV\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back where we see that a almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media\nWay uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media uh advertising on TV for the competitive races I digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook\nYeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly a successful in the two thousand sixteen of election cycles for a lot of victors are so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred and Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a\nIt's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd actually said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence I think both\nCome into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters in other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling a by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state that represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really\nCounts so that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that\n... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout if they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes more\nMoney does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank
