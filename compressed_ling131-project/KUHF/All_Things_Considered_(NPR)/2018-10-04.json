fellows many let's call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat his rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that on the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself well\n[laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of\nInternal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and

solution and one platform\nFeaturing digital video and audio with screen sharing\nAccount registration and more zone dot US\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro all the senators have been going in and out of a secure underground room at the Capitol viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe report is confidential and reactions have been divided Democrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau\nA final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's Kelsey Snell hike healthy as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us later in the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge cabinets\nPorter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that support here's what he said\nAnd I think after all the stronger in terms of understanding the facts before and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here\nMurkowski has mostly been ducking reporter it then she's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day others like Susan Collins of Maine and flake\nDid they say you know they haven't said exactly how their vote but they both say they found this report helpful\nCollins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually called for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before he Libya yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be found\nThere was still kind of reading the tea leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nHonestly virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential it is locked behind those closed doors in sub basement as the capital\nAnd we what we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR has confirmed the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cabin on forward from high school they also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who accused Kavanaugh drunken Lee exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties so like I said there's that one copy and the senators are just circulating through\nAnd telling us that and you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription and some of the conversations that they had we also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they're not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that [noise]\nSo senators now have to report the Senate majority leader has said he wants a vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh some time will likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote\nThat is necessary for them to move on they need fifty one votes to pass that and that makes this a really key test because fifty one of those does all it takes to approve his confirmation when that comes up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it and wants to find a book comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their mind after procedurals like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because vice president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final though comes about thirty hours later that means sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final the\nHealthy we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats in great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized then the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that you need to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this was in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet gets confirmed so we we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much\nInk you well as we just heard Kelsey note there the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he won so Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by from the due to than told me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for the form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the presumed reviews and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases would be allowed\nSo you filled out the form do you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called buck or we're by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question you\nKnow I think it's relevant because first of all the good ones should learn from the view so usually a committee or would have taken an oath and what is also trying to move to so it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\n... the ... was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being on aware of the phrases black you know I think we can use that was passing out but the black Neal cruise means doing things that you don't know if you've done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the student who talked occasionally frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nThe complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I speak to what I Know about new three maybe four to eighty five year college\nI Wonder what people here a little bit more about your work for people who aren't familiar with it so start with that portrait of Thomas Jefferson that I described talk to me about what you're trying to do\nHere so I had a conversation with a um American history teacher\nAnd somehow within that conversation there was this phrase that she authored yes but Thomas Jefferson was a benevolent slave owner\nAnd I I was sort of shocked by that I didn't really understand what she meant and I asked her to elaborate on it but she couldn't she didn't and we sort of suffer in silence for a little bit I went back to the studio and this is the painting that I made\nAnd so that particular piece is kind of pulling back the curtain on these ideas these illusions these stories that we tell ourselves about the founding fun to do that you're literally pulling pulling the canvas of the traditional portrait down that's right that's right\nAnd that really has to do with trying to for myself find a way in to these concepts that physically I'm so if you're asking yourself a question about what is it how do you make a painting about torture then you change that measures of the question what does it mean to torture paying thing\nRather than making paintings about something you make paintings that reflect the thing\nIt it sounds like if I'm hearing you write your big point isn't we got to forget the past we are going to erase it it's we have to shift or gays and confronted why did well I mean why does it matter to frame it in quite that way [noise]\nI don't think that pretending like it didn't happen is beneficial I think it's in fact damaging\nI think if we are not honest about our past than we cannot have a clear direction towards our future\nAnd so you know we're having a sort of national conversation right now about public monuments and in this discussion we are talking about a we have to sort of binary conversation about keeping these sculptures up or taking them down\nAnd I actually think that the binary conversation is problematic I think there's another possibility and I think that possibility has to do with bringing in a new work that speaks in conversation with this all work\nIt's about a willingness to confront I'm a very difficult past\nSo practically speaking you know apply that to all the robber daily and all the Jefferson Davis statutes that are all over the south is what you're saying they can stay there but let's build something alongside them that makes you think about this man this history and a different way\nLet me be absolutely clear\nIf we're continuing that binary conversation where we are saying either keep it up or take it down ticket down I don't feel in love with these sculpture that's not what this was about\nUh what I'm saying is the binary conversation doesn't bring all of the issues into consideration so there's a third option the third option is we engage our contemporary artist of this time\nAnd the same way that the WMBA did we bring in contemporary artists we have the mixed cultures that exist in the communities that they live in\nWe present those sculptures and the same community squares where these Robert easily sculptures exists we pull those ... sculptures\nDown from the pedestal brings them at the same level as these new contemporary works\nAnd we force these works to engage one another I think one of our challenges is that we we sort of consistently try to make public sculpture in a way that it's a sentence with the period at the end and inevitably it's not it's a comma and there should be a clause after that\nRather than thinking of the things that's the sort of like\nOn shifting concrete blocks at our favorite dish unintentional or just finished sentence Titus far\nArtist sculptor and now

accusing a group of Russian military intelligence officers of more cyber mischief the indictment from the U.S Justice Department describes hacks\nAgainst sports stars and against anti doping agencies in the U.S and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted a Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nAnd beer national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was at the Justice Department today she is most days and she is back here in the studio now with details you carry Hi Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged and why now it's tiny\nYeah the defendants are seven current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt paper say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all\nOf these seven Russian officers are in Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so cool why bother charging them\nWell FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries\nWhere there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ facets practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers America knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund\nThe assistant attorney general for national security joined emerged told reporters that Russia launched that cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations that it's athletes were invading drug\nTest embarrassed by the truce Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself now\nMary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of discharges carry and I have another question along those lines for us unknowns these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence\nOr coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt their press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for
