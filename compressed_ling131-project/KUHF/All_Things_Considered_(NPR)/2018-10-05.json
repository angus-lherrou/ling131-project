McDonald's sixteen times as he held a knife that aside the release of the video the shooting sparked widespread protests\nAnd a lot of people are asking what effect the partisan fight over Kevin ... might have on the high court a question no one is better poised to answer than NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so speaking of partisanship I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second\nStart with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about the ... that he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before a Supreme Court nominee using part isn't language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition\nPurely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact caused retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nA he said that he'd like cabinet as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote\nBut Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stephen since Stevens said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the root of the court who is not the ill see they get a new justice you know all they do for a part time job\nNo I don't really think the cabinet as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify and which ones it\nAppears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens than others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect chief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYou know Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on somebody's question she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh\nTo lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be mean for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes\nWhere the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that end than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the center of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning [noise] wow NPR's Nina Totenberg thanks as always thank you [noise]\n\n\nYou're

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been divisive and bruising and many fear it has been damaging to revered institutions the U.S Senate and the Supreme Court\nRon Elving is senior editor and correspondent on Washington desk here with NPR News and he is in our studio to talk about this higher on good to be with you Ari\nIt's always been known for a special kind of ... geology where members can work together respectfully despite political differences and reach compromises for the sake of a greater good that's been deteriorating for a while now do you think that Kavanaugh's confirmation process\nHis down even further damage\nIt's the latest symptom of an infection that's been present for some while we've had parties in the Senate almost from the very beginning but there have usually been at least a few conservatives in the liberal party liberals and the conservative party lots of moderates in between\nThe politics of the last quarter century however had been purging those crossovers and those moderates even those who now remains sounded increasingly like hardcore partisans\nAnd here's Sen Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina thought of at times in the past as something of a matter of brick somebody who could talk to both parties here he is at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a week ago addressing the Democrats across the room\nBoy y'all tower God I'll never get it of course Lindsey Graham is referring here to the mid term elections next month when Democrats had hoped to have at least an outside chance of getting back in the majority\nLindsey Graham new cameras were rolling then does language like that actually poisoned the kinds of relationships and interactions that you see behind closed doors or some of us just for formative\nWe should say there have always been occasions of heated rhetoric and angry words uh and especially from certain members at certain times but as you say that collegial nature of the chamber and the long six year terms that they have and the need for certain ... arrangements in super majorities that they have to get\nThat tended to bring people together\nBring them into a more cooperative mode of operation but that can break down and that is what democratic leader Chuck Schumer was referring to this morning on the Senate floor when he concluded his argument for rejecting Kevin\nOf the Supreme Court end of America\nMy colleagues will do so\nWe've been talking about the impact this fight is having on the Senate what about the Supreme Court where if confirmed Kavanaugh might serve for decades do you think this will have a long term impact there\nIt will be a burden on the members of the court who have proven remarkably good at times at least that ... their political differences within their larger relationship to each other and to the court and to the country and to the law\nNow that gets harder after a confirmation process such as this process that is stressed by the collision of major movements within the culture\nWithin the Supreme Court for years we've heard stories about justices with ideological differences having close friendships having a relationship that flourishes even though they might be on opposite sides of a political divide do you think this affects that kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are very different justice and yet quite close friends who would spend every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and so on\nThat kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with the background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will\nMake the court more visible doesn't mean they have to come out from underneath those robes doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN with that they're going to stop their very small group conferences but it does mean that for many people the court has been identified as something different from what it was before\nNPR's Ron Elving is a senior editor and correspondent on our

didn't eat meals for three years and ... men striking\nSo then I got hit by the ... gained the weight back and then some of it again to spice go\nAnd then you know it kind of slowly came off after a couple of years\nAnd then I developed asthma which maybe go on steroids which made me eat trees of cause and people I gained a lot of weight and I just made history as the first woman ever to host the

little too much\nAnd there's never an attention towards mental health will self love and appetizing and I think that's what needs to change I think we need to be more capital needs to be more police

of investigation she thought it was a thorough investigation I knew we were in trouble or they interviewed Tim people no more but ignored eight witnesses produced by Dr Ford twenty witnesses produced by Mr mirrors it was not a fool some incomplete professional investigation breathing means\nSenator Durbin referring there to Senator Susan Collins Utah man has been charged with threatening to use a biological toxin as a weapon for sending caster beans in four letter addressed to President Trump and other top government officials and here's Greg my radio has more\nThe FBI says the suspect William Clyde Allen put his name and home address on the letters he mailed to the president the FBI chief the defense secretary and the chief of naval operations\nFBI agents arrested Allen at his home in Logan, Utah and he made his first court appearance on friday\nAccording to the affidavit Allen a thirty nine year old navy veteran acknowledge sending the letters and his threatened the government officials previously he said he purchased caster beans on E. bay which were then matched up to create the poison rice and\nA memory works that way I mean Dr Ford the scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough to stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about of Ford's account against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more broadly\nSo I I I think that it's an important hearts they seem to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to a great deal and her and her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any cooperation and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm at in the case of ray Moore when he came out\nAnd accusers came forward to the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of the circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and express sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and and sort of in the early ... them from Republicans this has been\nA very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we ... we saw Brett Steve and and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone um let on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Susie ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was a fear Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play\nI I don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president's ah with the comments that you played\nA I think that really ... the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like that\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly\nIt could I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be at a function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much of this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I I think that there's probably did maybe pushing more rightward than he would have otherwise been had to spend as smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela

from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the clown McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this is guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge\nThis is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think are those activists it's yelling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course\nI'm happy with this verdict and concerned for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described with chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes is blank\nUm he said that that that that was ... raised in life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this and that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there than other trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald at present that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a\nA problem that the community feels but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'll be watching closely what happens in that trial on how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shot six soon made a big difference\nThis case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who account on Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that would require a lot of folks that I noticed\nDiversity improves company's bottom line that's why the greater Houston partnership invited community and business leaders for a summit called Houston next

to the Supreme Court tomorrow now the two previously undecided senators say they will vote yes Maine Republican Susan Collins and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin announced their support this afternoon\nPeople have been gathering in Washington and other cities to protest Kavanaugh's nomination NPR's Brakkton Booker spoke with some of them earlier today\n[noise] outside the U.S Capitol they held signs that read the lead the survivors and stop Kavanaugh Rachel ... is an attorney who traveled here from Anchorage, Alaska for a trip was funded by the American civil liberties union\nI'm here and part of the hash tag when you're in a gay women that group and the last count all the way down and dropped our lives or dies dollar responsibilities to attend to lobby our senators specifically Senator Murkowski said you know against the confirmation\nSki wound up voting no today as far as tomorrow's it's unclear sell it is clear on where she stands on Kavanaugh she says she would be trouble to appear before him especially after what she says for his partisan attacks last week during a city hearing\nSo I think there are many reasons not confirmed hand I think that one alone and how\nAll of our senators have breaking\nAnother woman Susan Barnes arrived in Washington from Rockford, Illinois with her daughter Leighton they're also here to protest and read me there are signs Eighteen year old lady who goes first\nIntegrity still matters now which is good for a beer with the guy's\nNot good for the Supreme Court\nSusan barn says she doesn't want to see Kevin ... on the high court because of the impassioned testimony of Christine Blasey Ford she told lawmakers last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her decades ago while they're both in high school\nI definitely felt for I ... I Am doctor for a bond\nSays she was sexually assaulted in high school and never once her daughter to go through something like that Kevin supporters were hard to find outside the Capitol today but Michael ... who says he's an independent was happy to take up the men's\nNobody else is out here on his side right now they're all here they need to hear that they need to hear that\nAs the time New York for the Senate to vote protesters huddled around a portable speaker of the clerk\nWill take a moment in the Senate to record the official tally expected to be fifty one to forty nine and the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination we'll advance\nFinal confirmation vote could happen\nSome protesters vowed to come back tomorrow even though it looks likely Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nIf that happens many say they will take their term casting a vote in next month's midterms\n\n... here in Washington [noise]\nIn July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee\nAmong the people gathered at the White House for the big announcement was John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome\nIt's a pleasure to be with you and my writing thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now ... and the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum interesting questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs assigned to the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo American cities or not he said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation as a family that he would have acted like an all time to time I had\nBy the way he acted like Tom and Tom\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nWhile I forward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific were marketing or he went on to say it was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up or when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and the ... gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nMy grandmother reminded me often or that I was very lucky not to be addicted to heroin when I was born a she was so you know anytime there might be a news report you know in the in the early mid eighties about kids who are addicted to drugs when they were born she could just pull out her cigarettes like you know you you're lucky you were born like that right you know that right [laughter]\nRight yeah you know whatever\nSo you begin to draw right but when you're very young and what kind of outlet does that come for you\nI becomes an escape it becomes the one world that I can control right so um it by the time at it it's therapeutic it gets my mind off things my mind as they are on the page a part of my research into this book because I saved every sketchbook\nI had throat my my teen years really and looking through them\nAll I could think about that kid was angry [laughter]\nYou know what I my grandparents never once considered you know putting me into therapy and part of that was their generation you know they they came of age and the great depression you just just didn't talk about things\nUm and so I you know I had friends that I could speak to I I certainly had some adults in my life I could speak to family members and and teachers at school who always very patiently offered listening ear to me but the sketch books to be able to work through some of this sort of darkness I had in my head\nUm it gave me an outlet\nYou write in your dedication you write in any dish into your grandparents and mom you said that the book is called for every reader who recognizes this experience ICU\nThere there is a rise in the number of uh grandparents raising their kids right the ... of the opioid crisis and when you read these stories [laughter]\nDo you think oh God there's a lot of kids who who are going to go through what I'm going through or what I what I went through\nThere are a lot of kids going through that now and of course when I was a kid I thought it was the only one in America being raised by my grandparents you know\nAnd I didn't take any other my peers and my elementary school a great school had these sorts of problems and come to find out later I mean they certainly did so I Know I Hope that dedication to young readers who are experiencing a similar\nAttracting life might feel less alone by that to know that I'm acknowledging that this might be an experience that they are also having\nIn the book you do kind of reconcile with your birth father you find him and you develop a kind of relationship with your birth mother do you feel like you ended up having a good relationship do you feel like you've kind of ... gave her for how you grow up\nWe had a great relationship for a number of years so she's she's skipped my high school graduation which is where this book and I'm Sorry spoiler alert the kid graduate high school and a and a ... and um\nSo I went off to college without having had any contact with her but my my grandparents made sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and so over the years we did develop a great\nRelationship um we danced at my wedding you know she got to meet\nMy first two kids um but it was it was it was when my second child was born that she started getting into trouble again sort of getting arrested again and a loss you wouldn't say say as much it was it was pretty clear that she started using again it she certainly was\nA surrounded herself by some nefarious individuals but I did ... my last discussion that last time I saw her was about a year before she died and we we left it with she said to me I Love you and I always will\nAnd without missing a beat and I said I Love you and I always will um she she never really took ownership though of if any of the stuff that happens um she would often say when are you just going to get over it which is a tough thing to say to a kid or\nYou just sort of learn to move past things but it's it's certainly nice when it's at least someone owns up to their poor behavior right which she she was never able to do\nWell ... thank you

I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about the\n... that he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before\nA Supreme Court nominee using part isn't language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition purely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCaused retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nAnd he said that he'd like Kavanaugh as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote\nBut Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that apparent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the root of the court who it is not in a healthy they get a new justice you know all they do put a part time job\nNow I don't really think the cabinet as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones it\nAppears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens and others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect\nChief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts and best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYeah Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on somebody's question she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh\nTo lessen the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five or ... says and\nHow big a challenge is that going to be mean for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes\nWhere the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that end than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes
