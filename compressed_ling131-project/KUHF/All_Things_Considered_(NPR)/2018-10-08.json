Chang\nWe're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food in the U.S ... taking a calculated risk\nThe country was growing people were moving into cities and industrialized nation Gaye food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWith fake re back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever\nThat's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S and acted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talk with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking ... someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one dairy man seeking to sort of stretch their profits what Senate with water it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which it was pond water pond water\nPond water and and and it was a notice when the family found worms wiggling and the mom\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would send them out you had to reconstituted in all kinds of weird way and say what shocked us that people were plastered ...\nThey look where a cold ... guys and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab to kind of make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish blue Russian then because it was prone to rot so this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives in it and the most popular one rose formaldehyde which is an embalming compound\nWhich is not good for humans to ingest\nNo and so you actually go out and can sing newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk scandals\nSo along comes the protagonist of your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue [noise]\nI always thought of them is kind of all how holy roller cameras right you of Harvey Washington while he was the son of itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry and the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemists that the U.S department of agriculture I mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded\nAt the department of agriculture was it an food safety he took up that cause\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from a project to tamper took it really shows his commitment to this ah describe but the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes that and the recruits other people at the department of agriculture especially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nThat three three meals a day seven days away super fancy meals they're cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree that half of you\nAt any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing suspected toxic come\nSounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they didn't they were from page news they were songs and you know musical numbers about them everyone is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there was this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly Congress men who are on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights that spans decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poisons glad experiments wants that law went into a place we started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out Salah ... acid went out bore acts went out we\nAre cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compounds\nIn this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story or something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person\nWho changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember that someone who is focused than even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century thanks for talking

strategy an official document which basically named to China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude you know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a rogue regime and one of the top threats to us security that it has to be dealt with harshly\nI really think that's the tone that China's reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials had been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's top stance with China hurt the U.S his ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nOr well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors is not just the north Korea issue\nThat the U.S needs China's help on it's it's so many issues of global importance but to us seems to want to put a competition with China in front of cooperation on these global issues\nAll right That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn thank you very much Anthony You're welcome it also [noise]\nYou're listening to your NPR station Houston Public media

Chang mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party many presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and news as NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything Democrats\n[noise]\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a crime all over the place you're going to be boring the border to lose your right to those guns you can ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to go into it as well ah\nThey really do even for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president last midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing their houses is a problem losing the son it's a contest\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nHave you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved and then the house the big the big problem will be the job of endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way that we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the Benghazi investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means but Trump I is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to talk to voters\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are re elected to the majority of ... of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIs possible to try to lead which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues but we're talking about a climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago and so\nDemocrats word or two people it would be you know an ugly would not find\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did with Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever shows that should be fired because clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think the president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do\nReal fifty six houses going up on what people were so like when they were sixty three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTrump rules whose party by fear are going to see them a lot less is they get their butts kicked he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been\nThe steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops that Instagram post that that really lengthy almost like scorched earth ah posted about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people got to really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that site today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still launch it appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure rating her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think it's going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always had an inside her mind from Italy ... Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything\nKind of has like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it I think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this\nShe kind of a looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out and like she didn't stay with us we're um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when it kind of music DJ\nIn ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... um I Would make myself more presentable I thought I'm I was careful of ally spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called out the races in life what well one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas\nAnd he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath\nAnd we could all pick a gift and it was like get gifts like we'll be cushions and all of this other stuff he's just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I pick the gifts and\nThere was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water gun\nAnd one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and\nBecause some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to\nUm and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that I was worth speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinated with this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white [noise] it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes through a ...\nOn a hot and so it costs though\nBut you still don't know if they did anything wrong\nOf us while we searched but if they open the door or reached through an open window they're probably going for with sort of I think I see a guy I don't hesitate to shoot it was so\nInteresting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just white against black racism it's much more complicated right you're ... you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know\nUh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols were free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught in some time that system can be taught with African Americans as well so you have that version and then also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys them inside ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma\nUnfortunately yeah yeah yeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and all these new I wanted to write young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because so often victims in these cases are teenagers or young people on Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve and\nI think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that when adults pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl them a thirty year old woman\nFor some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence who has so little experience you literally witnessed this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma\nAnd I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nWriter Angie Thomas and director of Georgetown and their new movie is called the hate you give thank you
