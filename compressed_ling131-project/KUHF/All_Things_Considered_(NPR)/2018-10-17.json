restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war there been high civilian casualties\nAnd that's something the U.S could press the Saudis on if they so chose\nThe other is this boycott of Qatar Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar is a very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there\nUm and and so that uh is something the U.S could could stress and say hey play

likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try

Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer about eleven ... million barrels per day\nSo Saturday El Al is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a

fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is\nHow it must be very different\nThe chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a de facto civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act\nWithin them that job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decisions the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during World War\nTwo he shared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case in before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a

as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when soldiers walking to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the rush\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSoldiers to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was where you go there would be questions potentially being asked if they have\nEver used marijuana and that can be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past the he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law\nBut because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nStill crane says it's hard to predict how the administration will proceed disastrous flooding in central Texas this week

this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly last name the two U.S Senate candidates from Texas debated in San Antonio\nThree weeks before election day it was an important opportunity for democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke an incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to make their cases to voters that debate like the race was downright nasty as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nSenator Ted Cruz is reelection campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent congressman Beto O'Rourke on TV\nI'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message medical more is more extreme than he once he didn't\nWant to attack ad which eventually seemed to backfire Cruz's campaign misleading edited video tape to make it appear as if all work said he supported flag burning which he did not say\nFederal roar physicians are too extreme for them just do this for ...\nUntil now Beto O'Rourke has declined to participate in negative campaigning but what the polls showing cruise with anywhere from six to nine point lead the congressman relented and has gone on the attack\nRepublicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform and yet Ted Cruz he's the only senator vote against moving forward with that conversation vowing to deport every single dream\nLast night or their debate in San Antonio this trend continues cruise painting O'Rourke is a dangerous extremist\nIf you work in energy if you work in oil and gas congressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking\nBut unlike their first debate last night O'Rourke hit back\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz and not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or ever take is dishonest why the president called on line to and it's why the nickname stuff because it's for\nAlthough cruise would force a laugh when a war attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats as a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment in forty nine years Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes in low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nIf cruise generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or work tended to speak the voters better angels\nWhether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now\nThe partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of the national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough our workers running way ahead of other Texas state wide Democrats close still gets you know cigar\nI think that a very good democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through that's why O'Rourke came up so strong on\nCruise ... is a professor of political science at Southern Methodist university\nCrews and ... is an acquired taste people respect him as a conservative fighter they don't necessarily like him they gave a roar of luck\nBut Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out it's not two years if not for years it's longer than that because demographic change is very slow\nBeto O'Rourke will appear in an hour long CNN town hall of it tomorrow evening and talent on the Texas border Ted Cruz declined to participate so ... role after the voters questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants\nThe case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see the missions policies change not to have race it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents Missouri's missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of give this a Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher and everything else similar to what is happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing\nWithout context what do you think of that idea so\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from the inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to somebody's opportunities or resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of that sort of have the same goal of diversity out of college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty\nWhat I like to do is just walk really slowly and look at the ground in his new book

Reserve\nWill back in July he said he wasn't happy with the fed rate hikes he suggested that they could interfere with the economic expansion\nAnd then more recently right after the stock market sell off he complained again the some a lot more strenuously you said the fed had gone crazy and was out of control\nThen yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat now the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend its policies if they get criticized\nYou ever heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independent so I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nYou know that's true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William McChesney Martin this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and in Nineteen sixty five LBJ some and Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talked\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening now\nHis rhetoric not surprisingly how blunt it is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other president who said the fed is crazy\nOr what one person is unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents want lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally make presence more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House it can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also serves kind of at the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere's no indication of that the fed is supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed Powell and that the fed is independent but the fed is relief seemed to have gotten the fed is really seemed to have gotten under your skin\nIs NPR's Uri

have control they hand out punishment\nNow she's got influence because she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive us threatening and I'm In er right you know that she threatened me\nNPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get disciplined at higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rolls\nOff twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a

specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are trimming corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about men that causes
