that if I told him this would make him cry\nThe someone did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would

billionaire claiming that he built his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay them back and I had to pay him back with interest that\nIdentity as a self made success with central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes the Trump family used to avoid gift and the state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws\n... one of the reporters who wrote this story welcome to all things considered thanks sorry\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred and Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump's set up over the years to funnel money to as children are especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities rehab general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one sprawling article and I'd like to tell me about one of them\nYou're right about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and install refrigerators and other appliances improper to use it for Trump owned\nIn practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all county looks like a\nCompany you know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper Fred Trump had always negotiated personally the prices for the things he bought\nBoilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety to ... bills for those items began being invoice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice they get the money and then they would create another envoys to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then doing\nFred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split\nBetween Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners of All right ...\nThat's right and they were performing no word for that the only work was done by an employee of Fred Trump's who was also a nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these billing things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against his son Donald us Fred Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors and he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him his father or somebody in the room realized right away this is\nNot where we want to go with this and he pushed back\nAnd ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge in a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or input over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties Russ ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me or\nThe New York times story you just heard about says Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do sell\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of ... so to the extent the IRS has resource as they're not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nIt appears to me that the state department of finance as an utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions involving the term family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nWe feel you weren't someone who would ordinarily reach out to in my email or you wouldn't ordinarily make the

between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nUs so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalize this agreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they up and up to clear burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to

of judge Brett Kavanaugh who wrote a letter in support of the Supreme Court nominee in August and now says he has changed his mind\nMark all slur within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program they keep for having me when you think back to the late eighties when you when Kavanaugh were in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was intense experience it's a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience were both among the most intense of my life\nWas Kevin all like back in law school when you were students together\nWhen we're in law school a wreck was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never and this is important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin all over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election you know I'm certainly aware that Brett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I would've chosen in that way\nAnd so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett that he was somebody that I liked but I called some people practice in front of the court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia\nAnd they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks in real good opinions\nAnd so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support I think\nIt really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr for given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government\nAnd having civil discourse with the quick quote branches of government is something that we have to expect from the Supreme Court in particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy club which are\nWrecked Kevin started by recognizing is uh that he liked her that he had my work but then when she has a hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he'd done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like the gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing no he did come back and apologize for that at least to center cobra char but that's something that is very hard to get over\nWhy do you consider that disqualified\nLike I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear irrigate the power to themselves and if he's going in with that kind of contempt ... equal branch it's deeply troubling\nI Know that you've been in touch with other classmates\nDo you feel that your representative or more of an outlier\nI'm an outlier in two ways I mean there was a lawyer for signing the letter in the first place was only twenty three out of a\nHundred and sixty some members of the class who signed it in the first place so that made me a liar and certainly an outlier or with by Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise] um so it's it's really only the two of us are among said oh group who who did those things do you still consider a friend [noise]\nYes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect that might be screened and my calls right now but uh I Hope not\nMark all sorts of Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor officer now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government wise so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier the fear that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chest inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also too you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWill contradict some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the age as held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and it's just and after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHa chest by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the H. S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nSo has federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\n... are there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAn even go to the point where one of the officials at the embassy\nSuggested that if this debate went ahead to the u._k. might get less favorable trade tons of to brag said Harwood was done it's just quite shocking that within an institution that was a hundred and Seventy five years old that prides itself on hosting free speech free exchange debates\nThat an outside influences trying to change that will try and stop us hosting a speaker\nIn a statement the Chinese embassy denied pressuring the union to Malcolm risk into former British foreign secretary was one of the speakers at the Durham debate he didn't think much of China's alleged tactics\nI thought it was pathetic it's something that the Chinese very foolishly do again in a good\nBeijing has spent years trying to influence how the world talks about China and risking says when the country was much weaker it was easy to ignore\nWhen I was a foreign secretary I was involved in the final stages of the negotiations or the transfer Hong Kong back to China and wants to the Dalai Lama was going to be in the United kingdom and I told my office that I Would be very happy to see a split or did they complain they said it was inappropriate\nBut nothing more than that happened because at that time they didn't have the diplomatic way to they have to de\n... says they were important reasons why China wants to frame it's global image Mitt or is that China scholar at Oxford University one\nOf the context for the obsessive way in which Chinese officials can sometimes think about the way that China is portrayed overseas is the fact that for the best part of a hundred and fifty years China was of course not in control of the time destiny\nIt was a period when foreign powers carved up China which the government calls the century of humiliation the government's recent economic boom changed all that\nThese days ... much better position to actually spread that narrative talk about itself in those terms\nWith we might say much allowed to make a ... and that is creating some cognitive dissonance I think for some parts of the American establishment which may be for a long time so that democracy was not in any way that China could guys but the only way that any country could possibly guys\nNow Chinese President Xi Jinping has gone further than past leaders arguing that China's authoritarian system is a model for others and alternative to liberal democracy young white ... with the Mercator Institute for China studies the Berlin based think tank\n... they would do is just point fingers and say well look at where democracy has gotten you look at the rational decisions you caught all Trump and the White House ... we just about a more\nWind field says the goal is to undermine support for the western system\nWhen young people can get off about the attractiveness or ... or ... so it's really ultimately about competition\nAnd who wins comes attempts to censor people as in the case of the Durham University debate have backfired but China's had success intimidating businesses as apologies by Mary odd and Mercedes Benz show Benedict Rogers says ... under only encourages the Chinese government Rogers works\nHere with the conservative parties
