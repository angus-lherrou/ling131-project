how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to let them know that number one they're um you have to let them know that they would be concerned about more than just the sport or basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou it was okay um I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and and the right way more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a drink a lot of the time\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your

and I'm Mary Louise Kelly did the Saudis murder Jamal cause showcase that provocative question is the headline of a New Yorker article\nExploring what happened to crush again fifty nine year old Saudi dissident and journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in its stumble a week ago today\nAnd was never seen walking out Robin Wright wrote that New Yorker article she is a long time chronicle or of the middle east who's been visiting Saudi Arabia since Nineteen eighty one\nAnd she joins me now Robin good to speak with you\nGood to be with you [noise] let me flip back on you that question that you posed in the New Yorker how real a possibility is it that Saudi Arabia murdered Saudi journalist ...\nIt's just stunning that there has been no proof of life now in a week and that the Saudis have offered no explanation for what happened to him his fiance waited for eleven hours outside of the conflict and\nFinally because he left his cell phone behind with a warning to call ... she did\nAnd that's where we stand and that's as little as we know today\nThe Saudis have offered a denial of any involvement the embassy here in Washington put out a statement calling or any claims of involvement outrageous and expressing concern for ... well being um it sounds as though you take those denials with a grain of salt\nWell I'm very struck by the fact you all had talked to me quite frequently over the past year about the threat he felt to his life even being in Washington DC\nYou've known him for decades I should mention I've known him for a long time and Jamal head I've talked to him quoted often over the past\nYear in his growing criticism about\nThe government effectively led by the crown prince Mohammed bin film on\nAnd he he told me in August that he was worried about the threat to his life and said that the kingdom would like to see him out of the picture as he put it I think he didn't realize how real that possibility would date or otherwise he would not have gone into the consulate\nIn Istanbul yeah you're right that the mystery surrounding his disappearance fits into a broader pattern a trend of silencing dissent to me about that what's the pattern that you see\nThe pattern is a clamp down on activists even as the\nGovernment talks about reforms in modernizing society and opening up to whether it's women\nMore the young a social\nLife and allowing movie theaters for the first time it's very striking that the kingdom jak as it allowed women to drive off all started picking up some of the biggest women activists one that's recently been sentenced to death and one of the most striking things drum Oliver said to me\nWith quite recently when he said that the crown prince with totally autocratic and\nTotally a liberal and that he was concerned not just for his own life but for others which had led him\nTo take a position he never thought he would remember this is a man who was a reluctant dissident he was someone who had supported the monarchy and still get in principle it was the type of role and the the tactics\nOf the young ... print that had led him to worry that his own life and to speak out for the first time after years of saying nothing on his own friends were\nArrested how far outside the realms of what is normal and Saudi Arabia are the crown princes tactics I mean Saudi Arabia as you well know it's never claimed to be a liberal democracy\nLook there are many murderous governments around the world and Saudi Arabia has arguably the most dismal record on human rights of any country in the world but this kind of\nExtra territorial action\nReally very unusual and a crackdown against someone who's not in Saudi Arabia crack down on people who shouldn't be the face\nOf a new young person who claimed that he was a reformer\nReally is very telling about to stay in the kingdom\nThank you Robin thank you that's the New Yorkers Robin Wright speaking with us about the disappearance of Saudi writer and dissident ... it's been a little\nMore than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key positions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places and the rules apply to all employers regardless the size of this comes as new\nPeter shelf coauthor of ... deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy already been written down\nNow that that's on his radar he says he'll come fly you know we're more bureaucratic hurdles that we're not used to\nCertainly for worthy causes of course Frank Kenya is Rochester base human resources consultant\nHis clients are small businesses he doesn't even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\nKenya estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected and he says prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then it requires feedback from the employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York state you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is a New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd you don't have training that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protective category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer knock during this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nPolice says she still deals with gender an expectation\nThat guy was that to me after that and he said no you're actually really good for a ... it's ... like

hearings in the Senate things were quiet inside the court know disruptions no arrest\nKavanaugh's wife actually lived there his two daughters skipped school to attend\nRetired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there to of course Kevin replaced him on the bench\nAnd at the start of the day chief justice John Roberts said it gives me great pleasure to welcome justice cabin out of the court\nAnd Roberts wished him along and happy career\nHe has been busy already he has hired for clerks all of them women I Will note uh we're told he spent the weekend reading up on cases did he actually speak much from the bench today he was really active for his first day on the job I counted more than ten questions from him to both sides mostly technical questions about the state of the law\nThe court today heard two cases about what kinds of crimes should trigger the arm career criminal act\nCongress passed that law to take dangerous people off the street it sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past the question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or burglaries counted or not [noise] sounds like neither of those cases today or\nOnes with big political or ideological divide winner cases going to come before him that would test this new five for makeup of the court yeah\nThe docket is not super polarized so far but there is a good chance the high court will consider whether to accept some cases that could wind up being blockbusters cases that they have to do with President Obama's docket immigration plan\nCases that might hit religious liberty against the rights of algae P. T. people or cases about the power and reach of the executive branch at least one of the justices today appear to be playing a long game that Elena Kagan she was appointed by President Obama but she and Brett Kavanaugh go back away she hired him to teach at Harvard law school when she was a dean there\nThey behaved very warmly together today laughed a lot and he shook her hand as he left the bench\nThe issue is whether she's trying a charm offensive on this new justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench Everytime huh\nBut what about the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan was so rancor is I think that were used that there would be this cloud of partisanship hanging over him and hanging over the court did you see any sign of that\nNot in the courtroom today Brett Kavanaugh of course introduced some of this himself in the Senate when he mentioned in organized campaign to go after him even citing the Clintons he\nSpoke Monday Night at a ceremony at the White House saying he wanted to be impartial unfair and part of a team of nine justices on the court but Kavanaugh off went out of his way at that event at the White House to thanks senators who made the difference in his confirmation\nPeople like Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd President Trump did not help matters when he said Kavanaugh\nHad been proven innocent of assault allegations that actually did not happen the president also apologized cabin on Monday for what he called the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to him during this campaign to get on the bench there was no hint of any of that in the Supreme\nCourt to a very different story inside the Supreme Court it sounds like a thanks very much carried my pleasure

the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's done an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly but she also is somebody that gets it\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for trying twenty I can promise\nYou what are we doing it for that one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nAll right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of that same are high also so why now why is really stepping down\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote a resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally near self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure forum\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as\nKind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right might have been held yeah\nSo the thing that's different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of many relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get confirmed today she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different what the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately not some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we assume that this is really the end of her\nPolitical career we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in ...\nTwenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run in twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina F. one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley says she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family\nThat's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin thank you [noise]\nThe national Security Agency

allegedly charge too much to whistle blowers who claim they suffered reprisals\nStorage a former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms still he's playing a visible role at an agency that

Edward Snowden a whistle blower to some and a traitor to others revealed many agency secrets in twenty Thirteen\nSince then the NSA his face much greater criticism in the debate over privacy in the
