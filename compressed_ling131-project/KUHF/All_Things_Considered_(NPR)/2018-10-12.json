when you just said uh we don't even know what it would look like and it above two degrees Celsius and ...\nShow on what we do have is we have some models\nAnd look at what the projected impacts would be and um for some of these impacts we have more certainty and for others we have less certainty there I said these so called wild cards on\nThat probably are are low low probability on but what had very high impact and where those thresholds lie on for some of those we are not completely\nI sure so if you think about shifting of ecosystems from a tropical forest to savannah like state or because you have such extreme drought and that would be not only catastrophic for the ecosystem and by diversity and services but also for carbon for carbon storage\nYou know and but frequently struck by people who say you know if we take it's gonna cost us money is going to cost taxpayers money to implement some of these things we're talking about\nBut the other side of the argument never gets talked about it what's it going to cost in terms of lines in capital and movement of populations and farming if we don't do\nAny of these things it's just it's so totally unbalanced on the other side\nThat's absolutely right and interestingly the report found that economic losses are actually much greater as temperatures rise and with middle income countries in Africa Southeast Asia and India Brazil Mexico\nI'm projected to be affected the most and they looked at on global GDP losses for one point five versus two degrees and found that it was significant like different\nOn a lot of these losses sometimes aren't even in the calculations to begin with a and I'm certainly if you have short term as um where you don't value later on economic impacts are as well as those that are harder to quantify um it doesn't get into the equation\n[noise] so uh you know we'll just have to wait and see what happens when we were because it's not a pretty picture the way we're\nNot ... it's not a pretty picture but there there's a lot we can do and we must do I you know first time in terms of the international process governments in twenty twenty on are invited to up their commitments and to increase the ambition of their ... and that's going to be really important\nOr what we know is the current commitments are not good enough to get us on track so I think on making sure that there's an expectation and a pressure for governments to do that on\nBut also for for people not to throw up their hands on because there is an incredibly were important role for everyone to play not on the government's but the private sector and also individuals and I'm a lot of different things that on individuals can do for sure most you know as they say\nWhy I was just thinking individuals can do I

station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nAnd I know said Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't to knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nAnd for people have been

fallout today over the disappearance and possible murder of Saudi journalist ... ... and\nWe're going to talk next about economic fallout titans of business and media and the tech world are supposed to be gathering in a couple of weeks in Riyadh for a huge investment summit Davos of the desert as it's been dubbed the hope was it would attract much needed foreign investment to the kingdom\nBut the RSVP list is suddenly shrinking among those pulling out the head of the world bank the c._e._o. of Viacom the editor in chief of the economist British entrepreneur Richard Branson\nNPR foreign affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been keeping track of this ever shifting ... and she's here now hey Jackie Hi matter so is this all down to concerns about Jamal sugar and what's happening there where people pulling out\nWell part of it is the fact that turkey is blaming the death of cars show gate on Saudi Arabia so it doesn't seem like a good idea for a lot of these participants to show up in Riyadh talking business or for a photo opportunity with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on\nUm some like tech venture capitalists Steve Case said they'd been looking forward to attending the event\nBut they want to find out what happened in ... and until then they're going to put their plans on hold\nMany media organizations such as the Financial Times in New York Times CNBC and Bloomberg among others it caught on which I just mentioned earlier on I'm going out there all pulling out as well in a number of their reporters and editors were due to be on panels despite this uh the Saudis say that the conference will go ahead\n[noise] from Saudi Arabia's perspective how worrying is this I mean how big a deal is this conference to Saudi Arabia and its economic plans\nAre hugely important to Saudi Arabia foreign investment in the kingdom has been falling quite dramatically over the past two years and it's also been a major flight of capital so sad either\nPulling their money out and putting it in to real estate or offshore banks or or shell companies so this conference was seen as a way to renew interest in doing business in Saudi Arabia and organizers were probably hoping for a replay of last year as conference which really generated a lot of excitement about doing business in the kingdom\nBut just two weeks after that conference the crown prince rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and government ministers are the ones where they were all\nIn in under house arrest and the Ritz Carlton and\nRaul under house arrest with almost three months and the Ritz Carlton which by the way is where this conference is taking place again this year [noise]\nUh I Know you have recently visited that hotel you've just been reporting for NPR in Saudi Arabia I mean ...\nTo what extent does\nThe kingdom remain an attractive investment opportunity for the rest of the world\nIt's still remains an attractive place to do business for sure and there is still keep business leaders that are going to attend the conference\nBecause of those opportunities the head of the major Wall Street banks um such as J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie diamond still expected to attend you know they've been are vying for lucrative role in the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco which is the world's largest oil company\nSays a lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steven ... is also expected to attend ...\nAll right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there a civil Wall Street will be there what about Congress where what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten ... billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week\nStock price has plunged Trump ripped into the fad for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed has gone crazy\nI think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fad for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also [noise]\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like that it's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans\nHe was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing\nAnd a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself or with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes are no I don't think\nThe president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe ... read it could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nWell you're not drinking them you're tasting them and says them out when you tell people that you for a living you have to taste four thousand whines a year\nThey're they're not exactly

Republicans but you think it could help a Democrat and house races because of the suburban women do it to ... the the biggest battle grounds there are largely in the suburbs where we had you know again the the women's vote is going to be absolutely crucial\nOkay I'm going to switch gears now Karen late last week your paper the Washington Post had\nA big blank space on the opinion page where a column from one of her papers journalists democracy hokey should have been ... has been a critic of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he's he disappeared out ten days ago after entering the Saudi conflict in Istanbul and he has now\nSeem to be dead your paper Karen tied his disappearance all the way to the crown prince personally how your colleagues make that direct link to someone\nYou're right that the you know increasingly the presumption a by intelligence sources on Capitol Hill and in the White House is that our colleague a Jamal ... is dead end that Saudi Arabia is to blame and one of the biggest pieces of evidence are U.S intelligence reports that\nThat shows that the crown prince actually ordered an operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia where he was supposed to be detained that the timing of all this is unclear but it is\nA it's if what we're hearing from from Turkish sources is true which is that a essentially is a hit squad Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the consulate\nUm it is just impossible to imagine that some kind of that an operation like that would not have happened without the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi\nGovernment tend when President Trump was asked about 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWill like John we'd all like we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars are being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to they\nDidn't let me turn to be let me turn this should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nWell like the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a pretty honest that were selling a democratic principles were selling human rights were selling us residents life\nDown to two for for money or even stipulate at a price and so it's sort of ... ... it's like the axis of greed and we're the Saudis are part of it uh and the second thing that's seems clear here is that we have spent the last couple of years\nSucking up to the Saudis and you would think if that would have a good effect on Saturday foreign policy you'd think they wouldn't do this sort of thing and so the idea of flattering people to get them to do your thing flattering really dictatorial regimes that does not seem to work so I'd say it's a low in sodium moment for American foreign policy\nRight that

Chang\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years\nAndrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pasture around a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see a some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this clerk for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThe

specifically Russian Spies not normally there might not be that much to talk of that's in spy craft is\nSupposed to be invisible but lately Russian Spies have been all over the headlines we have got to stories and in a moment we're going to meet a group of investigators who have been busy on masking Russian intelligence officers\nFirst we're going to dig into these headlines about the G argue Russian military intelligence and here to help us do that is NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre a graying Hi Mary Louise so that you are you has been around for\nA century since around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about that one was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have ah been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents the alleged agents who are accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a trade it is why spot flop was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all ... and his\nDaughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nThat assassination attempts that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on\nThat is correct and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go bad are back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing insults Barry but it will\nFill the\nSo there are blaming their explain that solved there is is beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you are going to to England\nYou would make a trip to falls there to see this power the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and fluffy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones\nRight and so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents\nAh with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing the the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March\nUm now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow has only been used a couple of days earlier\nI'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were caught I think\nWhat we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny uh\nThere's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions but what is the U.S trying\nTo do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details at a level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents Greg Myre thank you thank you [noise] turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nProblem is is that there is no to that conclusion other than the Russians face was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is

attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russia in person I put her photo shows are boy ...

Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases and abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill colonel worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't to knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal relief today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from
