he wanted to make\nBut I think people are also very aware of the flip side of this I mean I have many many Saudi friends with a lot of people that I keep in touch with and a lot of them are very scared you know again one of the best examples that we've seen that this was the fact that somebody like democracy who he who had worked for\nMembers of the royal family and then sort of part of that elite society decided that it was time to get out of town and go live in Virginia\nYou report it over the weekend about the tremendous turmoil all of this has caused with in the royal family besides the crown prince his father kings how mine could exert any meaningful pressure on the crown prince to change course at this point\nIt doesn't appear that there is anybody um and we really have to do differentiating between the leadership of the kingdom which I Would say is the is the king and the crown prince with the with the crown prince being the one who's doing the day to day management of the kingdom\nAnd the rest of the royal family I mean the royal family is a huge sprawling family we're talking thousands and thousands of princes princes\nOr what you did use to have in Saudi Arabia before this current leadership came into play was a much more of a consensus system of governing the place uh-huh throughout Saudi Arabia is history you've had kind of a group of ... princes who

T. guy spent six hours pushing water out of the building as a fire alarm begged him to evacuate that's\nProbably the one time that are really had a really deep concern that what if the building where

campaign today is the one and only day that you\nCan support meals on wheels and Heather associate with interfaith ministries of greater Houston is here with us talking about how this really is a personal touch for a lot of people I mean this is this is something that\nThousands of folks in the Houston region rely on for um human connection for the dignity of being able to live in their own home or just things that we take for granted on a day to day basis\nThat they've had said earlier or was it helps seniors to remain independent well what does that mean it means that they can stay in their own homes they don't have to give up their independence and move in with relatives or into an assisted living facility which is quite expensive\nI brings to mind a couple that I Know they live and Katie the man is in his nineties his wife a little bit older than he is he has been grappling with cancer for several years now and he is her primary caregiver and\nUh he gets older legs are a little weak it's very hard for him to stand in a kitchen preparing the meal and so he will say the only reason we are in our home today is because of meals on wheels so he can get up in the morning and prepare a very small breakfast for\nHim and his wife as well as a little snack at dinner time but\nThe hot meals that they receive in the afternoon it's so important to them as well as their volunteered driver they happy friended her they treat her as a daughter she knows them inside and out\nUm he loves mystery novels and so when she comes to their home and in addition to bringing up a meal for him and his wife she'll bring books that she thinks they might be interested in and so you know not only are you giving them nutrition and the ability to stay in their own home that you're giving them an outside\nFriend as well as someone else to interact\nWith and you know if you're thinking about that and you're thinking you know I don't know I mean this is the perfect opportunity\nTo give if you've been on the fence about giving to Houston Public media this is the day to dip your toe in the water this is the day to say you know what my ten dollars a month really will make a difference my ten dollars a month we'll make a huge difference for Houston Public media\nAnd for senior citizens in our community who rely on meals on wheels\n... another way to you know we hope as

pledge to this campaign will donate to meals calls right now eight eight\nNine zero nine zero eight eight seventh of eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight eight seven or you can go online to

hundred dollars a month or more thank you so much made a we appreciate that all of them supporting Houston Public media\nAnd lots of folks saying you know what I don't need to thank you gifts forego that thank you gift and allow me to instead use that little bit of money\nAnd send some meals to senior citizens Heather associate with interfaith ministries is here with us interfaith runs the Houston area meals on wheels program you guys recently expanded to Galveston as well\nAnd you know I'm sure\nIn the past year you've seen that the needs have changed a bit because we had a major disaster here in the Houston region that I'm sure affects the elderly population\nAbsolutely there are countless stories that we can tell you about it there's one lady named Donna who stands out particularly in my mind\nI'm trapped in her home she was rescued I'm with a a little tiny kids swimming pool the neighbors just pushed her to the floodwaters in that pool but unfortunately she can track did some bacteria from the floodwaters and had several toes amputated from one of her feet\nAs a result that's very hard for her to get around now says she has a new clients to meals on wheels and relies heavily on that one hot meal that has delivered to her every single day and as a result of Harvey we certainly do have new clientele with new needs and a waiting list of people\nWaiting to I'm not only get their hot meals every day but so many of them have pets and we want to bring food to those dogs and cats\nAs well as we said last hour we discovered years ago that when we were delivering meals to our seniors many of them were taking those meals and\nPutting them right down on the floor to have their pets out those pets are their family their and their best friends and we knew we needed to do something about that and so the ana meals program was created to bring dog and cat food to their pet sit at the seniors\nWould also be getting their nutrition well\nYou can support both those things right now with your donation to Houston Public media we are now the halfway point in our goal of providing five thousand meals thank you so much to everyone who's given the number is eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org from NPR News this is all things considered\nI Know if the Chang and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump declared over the weekend that the U.S is pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed the treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nFor the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case a complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio ... okay\nSo the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does history actually do\nBut you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S and Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could research targets and only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty record the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know if this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land based intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's so provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and administration are getting their way and it's not the state department this doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote it\nTwo thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and\nBolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government uh not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei ... was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency has says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U.S spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remembered thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has a stockpile ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ... administrators and might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the IMF at us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the threats has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stove nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting You're welcome audience [noise]\nThis is new San Diego seven your NPR station I'm Laurie Johnson it's our fall on the air
