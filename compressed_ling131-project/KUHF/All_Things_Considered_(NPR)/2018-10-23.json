you both thanks thanks ... president\nTrump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he reiterated the administration's announcement from this weekend that the U.S does intend to withdraw\nFrom the thirty year old nuclear nonproliferation treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and the cow Gorbachev today in Moscow Bolden said the treaty has outlived its purpose\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral for sickness all related treaty and I'm all for\nJoining us now to talk about what all of this will mean is Melissa ... at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ... nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thanks for having me too is what John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed its prime\n[noise] no not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union a first agreed to this in Nineteen eighty seven at one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect allies by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them\nHow we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe\nWhen they originally created\nThis agreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able to\nPrevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do and\nTo uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of this treaty\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called a ... twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installation or to hit an aircraft carrier and that's what the U.S has ... considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal then they can do so\nCould point out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both hold today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now does leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't do\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under potent and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nThe largest warhead is the one that has the security and\nUm that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\n[noise] Melissa ... of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise] [noise]\nMore of all

out inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish authorities sicker show was brutally murdered a Trump Administration says a record number of migrant families of arrived at the southwest border during the previous years NPR's Joel Rose explains that's according to official figures out today\nUS Customs and border protection apprehended more than a hundred and sixty thousand members of migrant families at the border and the fiscal year that just ended despite the Trump administration's effort to deter illegal immigration by separating families at the border\nThe total number of undocumented immigrants apprehended for the year was down slightly to just over half a million far below the numbers of the Nineteen nineties into thousands\nStill senior Trump Administration official caused the situation and unprecedented crisis because many migrant families must be released into the U.S to wait for their day in immigration court under a long standing settlement agreement\nThe Trump Administration calls that a loophole immigrant rights advocates say it's a crucial protection for families seeking asylum Joel Rose NPR News New York\nSupreme Court chief justice John Roberts says he is saddened by the news the Sandra Day O'Connor the first woman to serve on the high court has\nNow she has the beginning stages of dementia O'Connor who's eighty eight made the news about her declining help public in a letter yesterday she was appointed to the high court in Nineteen eighty one retired in two thousand six jittery investors sold off and largely bought back shares today is volatility return to the u._s. stock market\nHere's NPR's Yuki Noguchi concerns about a slowing Chinese economy and increasing tensions between the U.S in Saudi Arabia prompted an early sell off at one point the Dow Jones industrial average that nearly five hundred fifty points before rebounding in the latter part of the day\nOkay so you had a number of concerns there or the U.S relationship with Mexico the very real migration concerns is there also the concern for Mexico about its international image and all it is\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that since two thousand fourteen when Mexico started ... very high numbers of Central American migrants ... there's a double challenge here one is domestically\nBecause a lot of people in Mexico believes that Mexico is doing to us is quote unquote dirty work by stopping in deporting these individuals' back to their countries taking care of the problem for the U.S taking care of a problem for us with very little returned from the U.S for doing that\nAnd then the other challenges with international multinational organizations and NGOs that believe and I I I agree with them in many ways that Mexico is not observing it since national obligations to provide individuals who have a bona fide reason to fear for their lives with a refugee or asylum here in New Mexico\nWe the Mexican authorities deploying riot police but the police don't seem to be using force they don't seem to be stopping these migrants in any way does it seem like Mexico is not making a real effort to stop the flow of these migrants into the U.S\nI think Mexico is being doing humans work and supporting us since two thousand and fourteen but in an area like why does that mean what does it mean to support that it it means that does not fleeing because of persecution or fear for their lives most of them are being detained\nAnd deported and I think that Mexico using force\nTo shut down its border would play into the hands of those who are in this country or weaponized sing or seeking to weaponize immigration policy and who would use\nOnly deterrence to modify trans migration patents that have structural reasons and that will not be addressed by deterrence alone\nDo you get the sense that it should be the Mexican government's obligation or it should be their burden to process has many asylum seekers as possible within Mexico's borders rather than letting them continue their journey to the U.S\nThose who wish to stay in Mexico I leave the problem is that the majority of the Central America and don't want to stay in ... migrants don't want to stay in Mexico Mexico is a\nConduit to the U.S Mexico border challenges when you are Mexican authorities tell them you won't apply for asylum in Mexico they say no we want to go to the United states so unless you have something akin to what the us has to be with Canada\nIn terms of safe third country agreement it's very hard to ensure that by processing them they can stay in Mexico instead of right doing the truck to the U.S border well\nHow do you think the incoming Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador how do you think he might approach the situation differently if these caravans do continue into the next Mexican him an inspiration\nHe has said that he will try and give these many of the Central American migrants a work visa to be able to stay and work in Mexico\nFor ... years of labor perhaps as as a source of jumper labor the problem here is that unless Mexico and also the United states devise a feasible temporary worker program that allows for the legal flow of temporary workers coming back and forth our borders\nThese issues will be stopgap measures\nFormer Mexican ambassador to the U. S. Arturo sorrow Khan thank you very much for joining us today my great pleasure to be with you\nToday retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced that she has dementia and that she has decided to withdraw from public life she's the first woman to serve on the nation's highest court NPR legal correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nO'Connor's letter released by the court begins with these words friends and fellow Americans I Want to share some news with you some time ago doctors diagnosed me with the beginning stages of dementia as this condition has progressed I'm no longer able to participate in public life\nSince many people have asked about my current status in activities I Want to be open about these changes and while I'm Still able share some personal thoughts\nShe used the occasion to press for causes she has championed since her retirement twelve years ago judicial independence and the creation of a nationwide civics education program for middle and high school students\nWhen President Reagan nominated O'Connor to the court in Nineteen eighty one it was the fulfillment of a campaign promise to name a woman to the court and as O'Connor observed years later and an NPR interview in some ways it was also in affirmative act\nThe president reached out to decide I Want to appoint qualified woman to the court and I'm going to do it if I have a chance and he did that was out of the ordinary\nFor nearly a quarter century O'Connor's served on the nation's highest court casting votes so pivotal uncontroversial issues that she was often called the most powerful woman in America\nHer appointment we'd have a galvanizing effect on the place of women on the bench and in the practice of law\nO'Connor would preside over a period of change as women move from being anomalies in the law to a third of the state Supreme Court justices today and the majority of the students in many major American law school's\nChief justice John Roberts in a statement today called O'Connor a towering figure in the history of the United states and indeed the world\nShe serves he said as a role model not only for girls and women but for all those committed to equal

eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or make your gift to Houston Public media dot org\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Audie Cornish the Trump Administration says it's taking action against some of the Saudi officials at police are responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal ... secretary of state Mike palm pale made the announcement today\nWe've identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr to show that\nWe're taking appropriate actions which include revoking basis entering visa look out and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel the head of the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because she'll just killing at the fatty consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that does it look I'm Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said is temple along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nThe CIA never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe how things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they're conducting these sort of ... separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on and this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's the key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending Haspel there well the president clearly wants\nThis to end very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses um he talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea\nI think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and my ... to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who is responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYeah I think we saw today president or the wine gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis and and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country\nUm turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract so the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where whereas the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to to finish it up pretty quickly\nUm the ... the Turks have or we believe audiotapes um there's still a question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ... del of the Brookings Institution um and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think are to want to enjoy watching him BS twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded to all this wealth\nToday was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS of backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance and and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the big question of course will be will Mohammed bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties and ailing a so far NBS you're still in line to succeed him\nThat's NPR's Greg Myre thank you for your reporting thank you\nYou're listening to

NPR\nNews New York us national security adviser John Bolton says he raised the issue of Russian interference during the twenty sixteen election during meetings in Russia a doting you told Russian leader Vladimir ... and it's been detrimental to the country's own interest bold and commenting after two days of meetings in Moscow where he also said such actions of not really benefitted Russia\nThere had been public condolences for the family the Arab News where he got his start for his career published tributes to the slain journalist\nAnd while most Saudis have been afraid to offer an opinion publicly this morning I got a message on a secure phone apps favored by Saudis and it said simply Don Corleone did it period\nThat's Deborah Amos speaking to us from Princeton University and also NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Thanks to you both thanks thanks ...\nPresident Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he reiterated the administration's announcement from this weekend that the U.S does intend to withdraw\nFrom the thirty year old nuclear nonproliferation treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and the cow Gorbachev today in Moscow Bolden said the treaty has outlived its purpose\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral thoughts to national related treaty in a multi polar\nIs joining us now to talk about what all of this will mean is Melissa ... at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ... nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thanks for having me so it's John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed its prime\nNo not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union of first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven and one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect allies by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them\nHow we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe\nWhen they originally created disagreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able to\nPrevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really multi fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do and\nTo uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the street\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called the songs on twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installations or to hit an aircraft carrier and not what the U. S. is kind of considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal than they can do so\nCould pulling out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both holds today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now just leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that\nAnd you could retaliate if they didn't do a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under ...\nAnd she's in pain we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nLargest warhead is the one that has the security and um that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\n... more than in Middlebury
