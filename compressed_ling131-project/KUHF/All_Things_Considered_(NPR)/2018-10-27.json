{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Um that's a that's a really interesting um perspective I mean I don't think I've heard that phrase that way before it makes a lot of sense and a lot of ways it's complicated at a bank is that there are a lot of transgender people\nWho you wouldn't know were transgender walking down the street you know what I mean I think it's a little dicey where you draw the line you know what I mean [noise] Beatrice\nAt the start of this conversation you know was really she was confused at first about\nThe wording that question but that was like oh yeah I Do yes I support equal rights for everybody it's sort of [noise]\nAnd everybody can kind of agree on and then she suddenly introduce this idea that this could allow sex offenders and criminals to take advantage of this week law and\nPut her grandkids at risk and then she suddenly starts to weigh a bunch of things on one hand she says she used to be a nurse and she would have never turned away a transgender person at the same time she's like ever since I was a little kid I went to Catholic school and like there were boys' rooms and girls ... and that's just like how the world has worked\nAll along when the campus or D left Beatrice this house what was the net net of the conversation so at the end he has asked the same question she asked at the beginning how are\nYou gonna vote on this when our our ... laws on the ballot will you vote yes to keep these protections or vote no to repeal [noise] but yeah I mean do you say definitely us are probably [noise]\nRight I think here and I think I really appreciate [noise]\n\n\nHow do you feel that way [noise]\nWell um [noise] when she was saying about having um different restaurants or transgender people like the words like separate\nBut equal across through my head and that's not necessarily a right argument to bring to her because it's you know we don't want to be too confrontational over doing this work um 'cause we can't you know we can't bring somebody all the way but she was somebody she she was she was a nice lady definitely a good conversation\nOr genetic [noise] let me take one second\nI'm gonna call and I don't know I left feeling a little more skeptical some conversations I definitely felt certain I was like yeah this sort of binoculars your idea has happened but I think a lot of times\nIt can be messy and you leave people with like a storm of ideas that maybe aren't completely resolved and some of it like you're not going to resolve and them ten or Fifteen minute conversation with a stranger out your door\nAnd maybe it planted a seed and now is Beatrice Jesus and the new season the newspapers he's a commercial like this show understand the context which it exists but it's also possible that she'll never really think of this again\nNo this is all interesting bit of a political science and campaign strategy speculation at the moment but it's also something particularly of the moment\nThe Trump Administration apparently is working on a worked around so that transgender as a category of citizen effectively will cease to be and then therefore any particular protections\nRendered moved\nDoes that added urgency to the question three campaign\nMy theory going into this and I when I heard from people on the ground there is that basically if this loses in Massachusetts anti trends activists all over the country can go round and they say if liberal Massachusetts doesn't want these protections why should we have them in Wyoming or West Virginia or anywhere that they've come up for debate\nSo far as the mainstream even for the People's Republic of Massachusetts\nExactly I think the other thing is that it took a long time for the gay rights movement to get to a point where they had majority support it can be really hard to get a majority of people to vote for minority especially if they don't know them or if they don't understand them\nThe trends community is so much smaller than the gay and lesbian community I think it can be even harder to move the needle so if a strategy like this inoculation thing works or at least shows us a new angle that that might be able to be taken in the ... movement\nIt's promising I don't know that it might work as well on an issue like abortion that a lot of people have thought a lot about and made up their minds I think that's where the research wants to see where you can continue this\nRight now I think it works on something that people haven't actually given a lot of thought to in

horrific as NPR's hammer Keith reports Trump says it's an act of anti Semitism\nIn prepared remarks President Trump said it was a wicked active mass murder pure evil and unimaginable adding you wouldn't think such anti Semitism would be possible in this day and age\nOf ... of anti Semitism must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere to fears there was no tolerance for anti

Schaper NPR News Fort Lauderdale\nAs we heard Cesar say I allegedly sent pipe bombs to individuals and a news organization CNN that President Trump frequently criticized last night though the president bristled ethic gestures that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we want to if it's fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today\nI talked about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication we talking about the complaint of critics that President Trump has normalized and quote unquote other ring of people attacks on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nAnd to the extent that he it spans those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are now Andres in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctions and further that we have the whole Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around the state of his meeting with all kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them a later this weekend\nThey profess not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individuals the media I you know I was asking them about the tone that the president sets but they prefer not to hurt any of that\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically it's going to be a background of sanctions there\nHave been any device of moments in American history of any violent moment I mean assassinations politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you can ... the era as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is that now exist in an environment in which\nThese horrific acts that is bombs were sent to people ... two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them but it suggest as we've lost our capacity be horrified by the sort of action we've lost our ability to say whether they were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly\nAnd we are going to ask if the climate that is conducive to it's something that we are in any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with pictures that suggest just remember him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that than go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts\nHow we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say whoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we're going to look at the broader culture and ask how we minimize the likelihood that will ever happen\nAgain that is Kathleen Hall Jamieson professor of communication at the

will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them watch and they're on what's on their minds this election year and help us understand but we've been hearing we asked WHYY state Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Allen Say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of estate me and for the last six years Pennsylvania have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even fiber Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can say that name off\nFamily they grew up in the city they grew up in where they went to school what they studied pain they may have felt that you and I couldn't fathom that all that's how they approach problems and we put all that together\nAnd it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal by pulling everybody's unique perspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers ... says it's a legislative version of that\nAnd I tell everybody I mean if you ever had a chance to sit in on one of those meetings you'd be so proud of your country because you honestly guy cannot tell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whatever that is or run or whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say\nThat I I did my part when I was there to advance that belief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what Bob Said checked on their voter registration form when they're Eighteen we got to get past that\nCongressman ... thanks so much for for talking to us today thank you and WHYY stave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did but the Republican Party what do you make of that\nHe has a case to make that he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like India and he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and flow of legislation and nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\nThat's a WHYY state David statement seems so much for being with us today do to be with [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd we are continuing to learn more about the deadly shooting a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning the attack took place at the tree of life congregation ... morning
