allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law\nThe d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options to secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk it back in ... reverse it when they tried that earlier this year\nAnd so now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families speaking about crossing a such as those in the caravan right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail the separation in many cases they don't have\nThat of course is the case that the administration made when they rolled out of the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what would a watered down version look\nLike well they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one that could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely\nUntil their asylum cases resolved currently a court ruling says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks right as this would extend fat and immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear the objective a binary choice policy that the administration is considering punish and Cher families can protect this round ... of the administration's handling ration policy\nJohn Burnett in round two or water down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation the same challenges or if they're right I mean for example if they want to ramp up detention of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days\nOf the government doesn't have enough detention beds so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families being arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the devil and the Trump Administration\nAll along NPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Louise\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke ... has been one of the most controversial members of President Trump's cabinet there are numerous investigations into his conduct a secretary when the day began there were reports that he was planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening in Paris ... report\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling hub employees that Suzanne Israel tops HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary candle\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything and Liz Hempel which of the project on government oversight just house didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nAt really are they should be non political issues that over there and they should have an investigator background that kind of crime and that kind of watched outlaw\nTops is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other investigations says crusader director of the western values project a Montana based conservation watchdog group\nThere's another that involved a real estate deal that secretary think heat Family Foundation with potentially involve within his own town that would have in finance in art but in terms of Halliburton which of course has a lot of it before the department of interior\nBut today in a statement to NPR Interior Department spokeswoman Heather swept said Carson's email had false information in it that no decision was ever made to move tops to interior that while she was referred to the department by the White House as a potential candidate for a job in the inspector general's office quote\nAt the end of the day she was not offered a job and interior Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\nI'm any Robbins and news eighty eight seven morning news anchor when you support Houston

all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump is on the road again tonight he holds they rally for the Republican Senate candidate in Montana the first in a three day western swing\nNPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has been analyzing Trump's travel and she finds he is going to largely friendly territory\nAs President Trump came to the big finish at a recent rally his supporters crowded into the Kansas expo center shouted a law [noise]\n[noise] like\nMost of his campaign stops this year the rally was in a state Trump one and twenty sixteen the two candidates he brought up on stage or in races rated as a toss up by the cook Political Report\nHe doesn't go to places that are sure when they go to places that are short losses\nBill ... is the White House political director\nOf the point in time and the campaign where there isn't any time for for waste or to send the president to a place that in which the outcomes order decided so he's in places that are competitive that are up for grabs and and and in which he can make a real difference\nTrump's ability to help is limited though control of the house could be decided in suburban swing districts outside of major democratic strongholds but an NPR analysis finds Trump is largely avoiding those areas Jesse Ferguson is a democratic strategist\nIf he were to come to a suburban swing district most vulnerable Republicans would likely be busy washing their hair\nTrump is concentrating his efforts in areas where in twenty sixteen he outperformed previous Republican candidate\nPlaces like Erie, Pennsylvania where he campaigns last week areas Steffi and says\nThat are you know fashions of of Trump is that that can really are are more Trump and Republican\nTrump is campaigning for a mix of House Senate and gubernatorial candidates who is Debbie and puts it are echoing the president's message on policy ... most boldly and proudly boisterous rallies or a big part of the Trump experience\nBut the people who attend to these rallies aren't necessarily Republicans or regular mid term voters which is why I'm here Trump saying that while he isn't on the ballot his policies are\nWhat's it continue our in front of a moment\nYou after you get your friends your family your neighbors your co workers and get out and vote early voting\nSteffi and says as many as thirty percent of those in attendance at these rallies either voted for their first time in twenty sixteen or typically only vote in presidential years\nSo these are these are real opportunities in front of big crowds for the president introduced his coalition members were better quaint his coalition members those in attendance with the Republican nominee\nRepublican pollster Robert blizzard who worked on a congressional special election in Ohio where Trump held a rally on the eve of voting says he saw the president boost enthusiasm among based Republicans and in the places Trump is going he doesn't see much risk of it backfiring sense\nI mean democratic voters won the timescale are already like uh Thirteen\nWhich is to say democratic enthusiasm is through the roof and complacency among Republicans is a bigger concern\nAt this point in time Republicans will get all the negatives that are associated with the president we sure as heck my you know my going to go after the positives as well\nThe Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson isn't so sure about that\nWhen she goes to a district she is a reminder that Republicans in Congress had become is yet and voters right Shaq and balance not a servant\nDoes the president help more than he hurts it's a debate waged every mid term Trump said this week though if Republicans lose the house he doesn't bear responsibility because he's been campaigning so hard for them ...
