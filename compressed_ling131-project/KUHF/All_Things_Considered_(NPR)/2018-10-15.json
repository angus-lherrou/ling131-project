{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "But you argue and I think you use a boxing analogy referring to the famous rumbling the jungle between Mohammed Ali and George Foreman that he's not winning\nA that is correct both a recall about fire you know the foreman was heavily favored in fact so heavily favored many people fear that we would be killed them before and round seven the penultimate round if you were to ask you observers who's winning or most of them were them said foreman by a mile\nBut in fact the next round Ali came off the ropes and knocked him out\nAnd I think that that's a moment very close to where we are now Trump has expanded massive amounts of energy and political capital on a whole stream of initiatives but in fact they've had very little effect\nRight now has said he's going to go out the Paris climate accord as you say he has ... tell me why\nHe hasn't done it on my point is that the laws much bigger than Donald Trump I was asked can you stay the thesis of your book and three words and I said yes\nHe's not winning in the flurry of activity as with George Foreman it looks like a lot of happening but when you actually measure the long term impact he hasn't prevail so all they've done to make an announcement a so this leads to an interesting phenomenon\nBin Laden states across the board has resigned but not left from many of these organizations were still in the Iran deal\nUntil the end of twenty Eighteen but in these arrangements which the United states helped to create we now have little or no influence because who wants to listen to a lame duck\nWhat if he gets to ...\nWell I mean that's the question or a lot of what he has been able to do is because he had majorities in both houses but uh if you're asking what does it look like when I'll eat comes off the ropes you could see the following scenario that Trump loses one or both houses of Congress\nAnd then suddenly it might be that the traditional Republicans decide that Trump is not their candidate for twenty twenty\nFor the first time in a very long time we have a coalition government between\nTrump bites and traditional Republicans and they have a few areas of overlap of interests\nBut if that group decides that Trump is not the candidate who's going to get them back into the White House in twenty twenty or they have others available um for example Nikki Haley UN ambassador just resigned how\nDid you think ... resignation was intensive internationally and within the Trump Administration\nWell I you know in the land of the blind one idea is is queen she was better than others but her basic philosophy made little sense there are rumors that she was the person who wrote the famous anonymous out bad and that this was a face saving way for leave I don't know if that's true\nOr maybe she just decided which I think it's fair that she had gotten this much mileage out of business is going to get you know being associated with Donald Trump isn't good for your long term reputation\nDoes it matter it's he's trying to undermine international law given that international law he's all very well on paper but he's rarely enforced\nI think it's enforced every single day I just got back from the u._k. my bags were protected by the Warsaw Convention I landed I went through a passport line which was affected by the Schengen Agreement\nI went over to an ATM machine and withdrew pounds from us denominated account pursuant to\nSwift and other kinds of a banking protocols are protected by international law it's invisible but it's extraordinarily important in facilitating the way in which redo everything\nWhat do you think about the Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh ice quite well known in legal sickles sorry ... the idea of the international could be a restraint on executive power [noise]\nWell it's true there is one justice was my student back in the day he will take some time to find his feet or he certainly had a rough confirmation\nDo you think he got a real deal you knew him pretty well presumably\nA I think that I'm a here is supposed to do three things tell the truth\nAct like a Supreme Court justice and show that he is knowledgeable and trustworthy I don't think he did any of those things\nIn your book is also\nA cult election ... walk kind\nWell ah the Reverend Martin Luther king used to say the

this is a two plus decades problem in the making\nBut can I come back to this point because I think you know lawmakers contribute to divisiveness the way you talk to each other the way you talk about

of people are rooted in grounded and they're not going to make very good leaders for a republic\n[noise] so you don't sound all that excited to be a politician and yet people talk about you are in terms of uh maybe running for president one day talking about that you don't sound that excited to be fair\nI I think politics has a very useful role to play but it's about a framework for to liberty it's about the frame right the picture friend but the middle of the frame is American families thriving and working with their neighbor and disagreeing over the dinner table for days\nAlliances

wolf how did he get on to law enforcement's radar and the first place\nGenes love is fifty seven years old and he worked as the security director for the Senate intelligence committee for twenty eight of those years he's often being in the background of those pictures you see of well known people who were going in to testify or\nProvide interviews as part of the congressional investigation into Russian election interference he's for instance the guy behind the scenes\nA guiding President Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen in in into and out of\nThe Senate office building but what's himself came under scrutiny as part of a leak probe into who may have leaked the notion that Carter Page Trump\nA campaign advisor may have been the subject of a secret foreign intelligence surveillance court warrant\nAnd I was in that interview lie to the FBI and December twenty Seventeen about his contacts with reporter I mentioned you're at the courthouse you were in court this afternoon for this hearing how did it play out did this plea deal comes the surprise\nYou know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with reporters taxed encrypted messaging apps and that made it a hard case to defend now Wolfe was charged this year with three felony counts of lying\nBut in this plea deal he'll only plead guilty to one which means he likely faces zero to six months in prison and the judge ... brown Jackson let him go home today as long as he promises to return on December twenty for sentencing\nDid wolf himself speak in court today\nHe did the judge asked him point blank did you knowingly and willfully make a false statement to the FBI about your dealings with reporters and we'll send yes he broke down a few times got emotional and choked up\nEspecially when the judge told him there would be no trial in as a felon he couldn't vote or serve on a jury or own a firearm his defense lawyer pressed in Britain had\nHim on the back and handed him some issues on occasions to wrap this hearing and the defense lawyers also pointing out with with not charged with and did not admit to sharing any classified information\nThe defense team also says they are going to emphasize has long public service when he sense later\nThis year but this into context for us because the Trump Administration has made a point of saying it wants to crack down on leaks and on leakers does this case represent that in fact happening on are they doing more beyond this case\nYou know this effort is a little ironic because this administration the Trump Administration is among the leak gift and the last thirty or forty years they have their Justice Department has charged people in the FBI and other intelligence agencies sharing secrets with reporters\nAnd there are lots of ongoing investigations we don't hear about much the FBI of courses\nQuietly working many of these cases and even when they don't charge a compromise or leaks of classified information like they did not in this James with cave\nFor people who are interrogated or investigated by the FBI there's always a risk could they could charge you with lying to investigators instead that's exactly what happened in jeans with here and could be happening

states attorney who approved the sixty criminal charges against Duncan Hunter is a Trump Administration appointee\nThat data is being used without being classified as property and without explicit consent authorization and as a result there's this whole gray area about can you really make billions of dollars from a discovery that came from me\nFor a company has just rolled out an act that would let people specify how their medical data can and cannot be used people still won't owned their data but they can agree to do business with companies who are more explicit agreement about how it can be used companies could potentially be each user ten dollars a month for access to their data tours of\nHumanity dot code is framing it's for profit business as a fight for a new human right\nOr the palm of his company president\nBut data absolutely has a fair value as a real market value it's sixty billion dollar business right now just the medical do so why should we not have some component of that\nAnd they say they are taking one piece of building a technical framework to make these transactions possible Richard Harris NPR News\nWe're going to hear more from lawyer Jody Daniel she's going to talk with us about what we as consumers can do with our health data welcome to the program it's great to be here\nI Want to broaden the discussion out because Richards reporting focused on patient records but there are other ways that are health data can be collected by private companies especially now that they're smart watches and fitness trackers and things like that so um what are the rules around what can be collected and how it can\nBe used [noise] right now there are no federal rules governing the use of health data disinformation apart from what they say in their privacy policy\nIs basically the wild west any only limitation on what they can do with that data is what they stay in their privacy policies and you and I know that most people don't read the privacy policy is because they are very hard to read a hard to understand a very complicated and we just want to use the tool that can help us in managing our healthcare this\nFeels crazy to me because when it comes to the smart watch business which is only growing if you look at a company like apple they're kind of doubling down on this technology is because we are basically by agreeing to use the product handing the stuff over to them like how come the rules are different for them\n[noise] the rules were designed when all of the health data was in the doctor's office and hospital and in the health plan and so the rules apply to those entity is but yes when we sign up for a smart devices smart watch a health that we're basically giving them permission these companies permission to use our data\nHowever they see fit and they usually outlined on their privacy policy which could also mean they could sell it that's correct if a company gets access to your information because you give it to them they may be able to sell it and it might be perfectly legal unless they specifically say they won't\nDo they sell it is there a market right now for and people's data about their blood sugar or whatever\nYeah health information is incredibly valuable and a lot of companies that collect vast amounts of health information from individuals are selling at least aggregate or do you identify data\nTo pharmaceutical companies that are trying to understand how their medication might work or what might be an opportunity for them to help improve diagnosis or treatment of and you said\nThe identifies I mean you're a data point in a large spreadsheets\nYou could be a data point in large spreadsheet but there isn't necessarily any prohibition on them selling identifiable data and so you really have to be careful and make sure that\nThey said that they will not use your identifiable data in ways that you don't want like for sale\nIs there a movement to give us more control over our health data or privacy protections or something\nWe are seeing a lot of conversations in Congress and we are seeing some changes at the state level for example the state of California has recently passed\nVery privacy protective law regarding data generally but they've carved out health information that's protected under federal law or under California state law to these added privacy protections actually don't apply to the health data\nAlready a subject to a mix of the law\nWhich is kind of a big deal given that attempt to Silicon Valley [laughter] very interesting yeah Jodie Danielle is a digital health
