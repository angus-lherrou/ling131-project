have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stories with a partisan or mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flag about one hundred Facebook pages that millions of followers and he's with us now for school Smith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America\nAnd he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York critical for thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me ask you to walk me through this now distorted\nBecause you were trying to understand how well you are legitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and was pushing content with it and had more followers than you tell me about that correct yes so\nI was just helping my communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they've been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European website the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people are just trying to sell T shirts or something\nThey're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nYou tell me about that what kinds of things where they using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located them and in Bulgaria\nOne particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed in on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond\nNow it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build the following this was a conspiracy\nWhat I'm basically doing is is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team can take the actual experts to analyze the data die found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it\nWhat is it that you think is attracting people as it is it because they could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically\nSo blends in their goal is to blend in with and amplify the extremes in this country\nThat the ultimate goal here is is not veterans it has to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function as a democracy in the way that they do that is they sabotage any\nIdea of bipartisanship not just for our elected members of Congress but for the electric and we use a society need to start educating ourselves on the issue

a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\n... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated may have watched her testimony and I felt it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot\nYou know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar I get something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and a half step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me\nBecause I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us one out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa\nShe looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her panties off and then he he pulled honest than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\nMy only theory is that\nHe wasn't used to being told he couldn't do something I look in the court testimony it came out they're not here to impregnated in another woman at one point and had threatened her and kind of pressured her to get an abortion and that one and she did and that worked out and many of had this other son\nOf four or five years before and then ... Adams was absolutely adamant that she was going to have this baby I do not think he enjoyed being told no at any point in his life\nAnd so that's the only I I guess you know there's far more to it certainly been just that but I think\nThat's part of it is that you know athletes have to learn but no means no just like the rest of us need to learn it and it's a it's a lesson that I think a pro sports is trying to teach but still has a long way to go\nThat Scott Fowler the Charlotte Observer he's produced a seven part pod cast and printed series called curve Ruth about great careers who is released from prison tomorrow\nIt's going to sound like thanks for joining\nThank you so much [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's been more than a month since natural gas fires and explosions erupted across three communities just north of Boston thousands of homes there still don't have heat and now things are starting to get chilly in New England Craig lemoult of member station WBUR GBH has the story of families they're bracing for colder temperatures\nAnd that September evening Kelsey grinding in Tim Kurdish noticed the smell of natural gas in Lawrence apartment\nAnd then we actually felt the explosion from the house I Believe on ... street\nAbout eighty homes and the three neighboring communities Lawrence Andover in North Andover were on fire several houses blew up including one explosion that killed a teenager I mean if it's if it was scary thousands of homes were evacuated including theirs and they stayed with family for a few days\nBut they're back home now with their one and a half year old Ricky who titles around holding a rubber duck\nGrounded worked at a pizza shop down the street but it's out of work because it's been closed since the natural gas was shut off more than a month ago and they don't have any eat at home\nAnd it's been cold and then he ... and then you know basement apartment so naturally the concrete as got me call just what that alone [noise]\nA small space heater sits in the middle of the floor Ricky keeps tunneling towards\n... since the incident utility\nColumbia gas has been working to replace forty four miles of old pipeline\nThere also busy replacing thousands of damaged furnishes water heaters in home appliances and they say they're on track to meet their target restoring all service by November nineteenth Curtis doesn't trust that'll happen and says he just doesn't know when they'll have you know no idea\nI don't even know how this happened you know that's under investigation a preliminary report faulted Columbia gas for not taking proper safety measures to prevent the disaster\nAs it gets colder utilities putting people up in temporary housing and grunt and says she's been trying to get one of those spots they told her the family could have a hotel room in Nashua New Hampshire about twenty miles away\nRights alone for say that's not going to work we don't have a vehicle\nAnd her stepfather who also lives with them is getting cancer treatments nearby and can't be that far away Andrew mailer the manager of north Andover says a lot of people would rather stay home\nBut I think as it becomes multiple days of the next week or so were steadily in the thirties up in the evening that's not something that can be sustained in a safe way\nEspecially since there's a real concern that some space heaters might start fires Columbia gas spokesman dean Lieberman says they've taken in more than Twenty one thousand claims from customers for everything from damaged appliances to lost wages and they place more than ...

know a profession because you I think it really helps you to when you're teaching it helps you to um you know be grounded in what you really believe\nAnd you know so much I think back then was based around the French kitchen and so both of us through ... and then through working in\nGreat restaurants which were all French restaurants at the time and and in France and Italy and France right we both work the year Mary Sue in Paris and myself in the south of France and I think that training gave us technique and skills that\nI think was really the backbone of us being able to that explore other cuisines or at least that's how it felt to us is that there was such a great strong background and the French kitchen that then when we were able to explore other cuisines we're able to take them apart in ways that I don't know that we could have if we didn't have that training\n[noise] this is super interesting 'cause I Want to get to to your cooking um because I think you're known a you know like when I was growing up I first heard of you through your TV show too hot tamales and I'm like okay they\nDon't act like you're so young friends at work so called [laughter]\nWow so what I was in the ... and my mom would have a show\nLike no no but I was a you know what that shows Nineteen Ninety five\nNinety I listen to this rally Food Network began um but anyway my point is I I thought of you as being chefs are good Mexican food and certainly reporter grill which is your family of ah restaurants\nBut I Want to go back a bit to see in Nineteen eighty one you're opening her first restaurants and cafes or what you switch of the stove and the kitchen you're cooking practically in the parking lot and running the food\nAnd no no no not practically [laughter] we had to have bad days on the ground in the parking lot where many of the customers park\nAnd we only use them at night yeah we only as dumb at night that the day time it was more sandwiches yeah salad yeah [laughter]\nSo you're literally cooking in the you know it's just very um you know somebody who is very by your bootstraps kind of place\nAnd yeah you get into following because you weren't cooking French cooking you were cooking is really internationally inspired food so it's interesting to hear you had classical French training what inspired you to start taking in all these other influence and this was\nEighty one right so this is not comment at the time in clinical chef restaurants\nYeah not at all it was actually um\nYou know there was mommy's on there is boggle opened in eighty one also no no no no I used to oh I only had if I go and do they do and that's right yeah so there was a little bit of a kind of a addressed towards more um\nYou know casual but modern and really exciting food with Wolfgang ... ... but are you on that\nThere was ... you know Martin's Valentino\nNot very many um restaurants that were pushing the envelope and ... yeah we decided I'm too pretty much follow our hearts you know we were at a tiny restaurant with eight tables and nine students at the bar\nAnd we cooked whatever we loved but the first couple of years there was a lot of ... country French food because that's what we were drawn to much more than the nouveau cuisine and the fancy hot cuisine\nI mean we had married soon I had met at little pair okay in Chicago and he was doing very cutting edge dishes that and you know the ... that was just an amazing restaurant tour so we were doing things like taking hold baby lambs and stuffing those and then\nPoaching all the different components of it and when we both came back from being in France and we decided to open up our first little place the menu was made above things like cats are they part of the ... the a duck so mall country ... not anything\nBut we also did things like pasta salad and yeah and you know sandwiches and things that were very um you know it was a it was a cafe it was open from eight in the morning till ten at night so it wasn't anything like um you know any of the fancy restaurants we'd been trained in so we had to also kind of dig and\nFigure out what what let's make Susan's mothers\nColeslaw or her pickles or let's make you know German potato salad that my mom made and we would do that but then\nAfter about two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan\nI'm decided that she was going to take a trip and go to India and I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of\n[noise] like a fake\nFight to her racing we were racing to see who

I think we sort of ignored it a lot of the time we can always be our [laughter] I Know and it and then it was like okay we got to go so it was but it can be oh but see you next time yeah [laughter] it was\nIt was pretty fun and we saw we almost salt we're on vacation because we weren't used to working you know from seven in the morning till eleven at night you know six days a week\nIn the studio we'd be getting off start at seven to get off at six\nAnd we'd be like oh yeah we've got the whole night a lot of New York and he has rake\nAnd yeah but okay so like\nFour years I think show read to her tamales round so remember hundreds and hundreds of episode you've had many restaurants with the urine and Susan you actually have restaurants apart from Mary Sue\nAs well put together you've been a business partnership for Thirty years\nIt's an eight I think that eight now thirty eight\nHundred yards like five years into my marriage it feels like it's the only thing I don't know how to help\nTo together and did it feel like\nYou were in there but we're going to be together for Thirty years plus\nI'm I think it did for me anyway um it was when I met Susan we were the only two women she I was the first and she was the second ... okay and I had never met anyone that I could that was so comfortable with just to cook with it was just really very automatic and easy\nBut then you know she went her way and I went my way and I didn't really think about it or there was no conscious decision but after I'm kind of keeping in touch when we ended up in France around the same time kind of serendipitously we I think we that was when we\nUm had a couple of bottles of wine and looked out the window and there was a rainbow and we said okay let in Paris let's open a restaurant together and um\nYou know I remember I still I got to find that no book because it had things that have had like names of restaurants like mad ... says [laughter] really goofy like didn't have any money or anything\nBut you know I think over the years um it's been a real sometimes challenge and a real joy I think the times that uh I appreciate Susan the most is when\nWe've gone through a failure or were failing because failing together is so much more fun than failing by your cell phone [laughter] you can imagine and of course there's plenty of ups and downs and we've always um I think been\nReally sensitive to each other's needs you know I've got two kids and Susan's you know got her partner of a long time but basically you know we're different people and we ... we have different needs\nSo it can't always be the same it has to change our partnership has to change\nAnd I think we both\nProbably through each of our individual therapy you know took responsibility for you know where we were at in our lives and what we want it and I think\nThat helped because we were willing to be flexible so we allowed that openness to happen and so I think that's what helped us be able to stay great partners and\nThere's there's something so amazing about having a partner who you trust in ... you know it doesn't mean we don't disagree or that we're always on the same page because we definitely are\nAnd sometimes we might not even completely trust each other [laughter] I Know you think we do\nBut there are times when Hi this is brand new way to think of her being out there but when we argue about\nThings it's definitely like [noise] you know I don't trust that point of view [noise] oh yeah you know I I I think there are things like I Know that no matter what like if something were to go down that we would both be there to take care of it you know we pulled together in a really strong away\nAnd we must have you know intuitively known that our skill sets were different enough that we would complement each other a lot and be able to kind of fill in the blanks which is a good thing in a bad thing because you know I never really have um they had to develop certain skills because Susan would always take care of that like\nYou know coddling and babysitting the employees [laughter] I didn't know them [laughter]\nBut uh you know so I um but when we we've had we've matured we've both gotten better at doing what the other does also ... to just become more of a well rounded sort of individual yeah because I think in the beginning we were very\nYou know we had real separate um I Love pastries I like order I like things to work I like things to happen and the flow and the way that they should Susan adores\nThe hotline that chaos and she loves the problem she loves everything falling apart [laughter] so I it's just you know we're lucky that we have those complimentary skill sets\nA with what your this is such a cheesy now to him and I have my ... year like this to you for each other's live union things would sharpen each other what a gift to have the answer is friendship can garage\nLeft one she's the I like that yeah I feel for each other's knives I think that's brilliant\nAs all like if we can do when you're saying like oh it's\nDifferent but we had to learn to do each of those things are just coming oh you you sharpen yourself against one another I think that's such a key to a a creative partnership\nSo congratulations again on the award on Thirty years together and business\nMaybe many many more and it was great to talk with you\nThank you so much
