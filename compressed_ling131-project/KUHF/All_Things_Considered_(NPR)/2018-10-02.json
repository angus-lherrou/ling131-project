but could lead to changes in the process NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been posing those sorts of questions to lawyers have been responsible for vetting judges carried joins us now hey Carey I also\nSo that they will judge is already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising that the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nIt's true that judge candidates get asked a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll Russians things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a ... what about financial improprieties but those questions usually start at age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but\nThere were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rockets parties his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC words like what happened at Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown ...\nIn a time in a speech when he reminisced about baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours I mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have pointed out the system has adapted in the past

dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVern in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned

would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are

explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate sun himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point in time to say look

that much time does about six emails and press conferences and and telephone interview I think tomorrow it'll thinking\nNow I understand you when your word for what's called ... pulls amplification I had never heard that phrase in my entire life but I read that it is a technique used in laser eye surgery which I badly need so I'm very grateful to you um when that paper came out this was your first scientific paper ever right\nThat's right so in the simplest way you can ... can you explain to all of us when his shirt pulse amplification\nOr actually it was done and radar we didn't realize that you know during World War two so it was quite a few years before we did it again in optics\nBut it is the idea that if you really want to a huge a fourth on something like an electron electric field\nYou need a the take power and peak power energy per unit time\nAnd at the time of a CPA invention you could have either big energy lasers or you could have short pulse lasers but if you put a shortfall through this enormous the electric field actually destroyed the amplifier the couldn't have both\nAnd so the idea of tripped false amplification is if you ... where ... comes from a bird's chair 'cause they changed the frequency in time if they came up or down\nAt it really means that all the different colors of the light travel faster or slower I sit down with a fiber so that the rest

F. A. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster\nNPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Jeff Hi Ari first of all what are these chemicals\nOr pee fast it's an entire group of several thousand men may chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at repellent oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\n... also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers in the millions\nHow harmful to people kind of chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say P passes are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\nPiece off chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease elevated cholesterol\nOn the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U.
