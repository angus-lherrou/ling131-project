Louise Kelly we're going to talk now about the man behind name you have been hearing a lot these last few days ... he is the Saudi journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate and assemble last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped or maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose but who is or was ... and why would he have been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime\nAt such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion\nOr we're going to put those questions now to ... of the Brookings Institution welcome Hi thanks for having me glad to have you with us All right we know some basic facts ... age fifty nine\nOr that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government in Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support\nNew Saudi policies under a new leadership and he left Saudi Arabia in June twenty Seventeen he went into exile he came to the yeah came to the U.S\nAnd started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader Mohammed bin Salman also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he supported some of the general reforms that MBBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that if Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people had to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and NBS in particular increasingly moved in a direction where they didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd ... he couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained\nTo have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote what he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting to put himself into danger\nYou know I don't know if we can point to one moment but I think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post\nThe fact that he knew many and the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively I'm casting doubt on ... been selling man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen Mohammed ... says he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformers that America should hit shit swag into\nThis is interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a as a more of a danger than others at that he had such a platform that he was so well connected\nIn Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different if you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it still strike you as puzzling now I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like\nA massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it\nThat Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials said yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference it's almost as if you know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that\nBut I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks so much for having me and my pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal ...\nNow cause show these disappearance and possible murder is straining relations between Washington and Riyadh and it comes at a time of heightened tension between the U.S and turkey where because she'll be was last seen\nThe Trump Administration says it is giving the disappearance high level attention but the U.S has new ambassador in either Saudi Arabia or turkey NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nRobert Jordan was the Bush administration's ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the wake of this September eleventh attacks and he says in times like this it's crucial to have an ambassador someone who's appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate\nYou can't really deal with the highest level or government on the ground without aggressor and without someone constantly ground for American in\nJordan now a diplomat in residence at Southern Methodist university says an ambassador would help coordinate us efforts on the ground in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia to find out what happened to a gym out cars show

show the world every ...\nCushion or Trump's son in law has close ties with the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin some on a powerful figure who's accused of being behind the disappearance of the journalists questionnaire is relying on Saudi help for Middle East peace plan he has yet to unveil\nFormer ambassador Jordan says it's possible that the crown prince feels embolden by this relationship with Trump sounded alone and it's for the president he says he wants to get to the bottom of the show the situation but he's not ready to cut off lucrative arms deals\nIf we don't sell it to them they'll say well thank you very much will live from Russia or thank you very much will buy from China that doesn't help us not when it comes to jobs and not what it comes to our house is losing out on that where\nTrump was speaking a day after a group of senators sent him a letter requiring him to consider sanctions against Saudi Arabia and Senator Chris Murphy is also calling on Trump to stop supporting the Saudi military campaign in Yemen\nThat bombing campaign in our participation in is predicated on our belief that the Saudis are telling the truth that they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians given the fact that it is likely they are not telling the truth about what happened to ... to show you why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside yeah\nJordan the former ambassador says the private sector should also speak out and boycott an upcoming investment conference in Saudi Arabia\nI just decided that he would be

struck me is that he avoided criticizing President Trump and ... and most issues particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failure he didn't say it's a fight he wants to repeat and that's not what a

of spending and speaking of immigration did you ask about the border wall which people are talking about uh getting funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over\nThe border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans he\nSaid about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that's not the down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation other big spending fight\nOne other thing that you that you raised with him was women and where women are left

That's NPR's Debbie Elliott in Panama City Florida thank you daddy You're welcome\nTo another story now millions of Americans post our ancestry information online new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in on relatives who may have committed a crime NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect first series of brutal rapes and murders and California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nAs the golfing killer finally the cash or California investigators ... jet match dot com to name jokes have changed the Angelo as a suspect and the genealogy website to try to identify the notorious Golden State killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young leave early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful ... to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify a relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person to stop the base is it because that illuminate hundreds of these ... these so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these other bases to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system\nUses multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives in our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological record you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd early use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese picnic doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals as these techniques but you can also using this technique for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police currency is using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay refusing to stick to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift do DNA behind a wheel K with his foreign governments are going to exploited expect me\nTo identify us citizens for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children things like that it\nJust [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd create tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow and that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nBecause the language that we have around sexuality and gender is constantly evolving you know a thing that we talk about in the episode is how the increased prominence of queer identity of trans identity of people declaring themselves and their sexuality in these ways that are new to many people\nThat almost doesn't fit what you could call the old model of coming out and there's also you know this phenomenon we go we go from Ellen coming out some Twenty years ago Hammons artist exactly to artist like Frank Ocean\nWho came out but didn't use the word gay or Janelle Monet who didn't come out as gay or lesbian or by she came out as pan sexual\nIt's just a different language and a different rubric almost so of course that just changes what coming out is stupid you walk away\nFrom this forming an opinion about\nYourself [noise] um I think it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being angry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path of my process\nAnd just feeling a bit more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know there was this feeling throughout the entire episode where\nThe listeners we talked to coming out is not just declaring yourself to the world\nIt is declaring yourself to every earlier version of yourself and tell them that person they're cool too\nThat's NPR's Sam Sanders you can check out his whole episode on the history of coming out and what it means today by going to the pie caffeine for it's been a minute
