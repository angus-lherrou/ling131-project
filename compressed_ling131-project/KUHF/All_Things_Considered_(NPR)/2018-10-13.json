in Georgia allegations of voters depression or grabbing headlines in a tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who if elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists their ceiling can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold and majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this uh we called up mark nice the he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nThat resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this lies disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case you\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular routine does and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBranch and running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nWhat I Will say about Taylor is that for a long time she didn't speak about her political views and she said back in two thousand twelve that the reason she didn't speak about her political views was because she didn't feel like she had enough life experience to for anyone to to really like take her advice and she didn't want people to vote\nBased on what she said because she didn't feel like she knew enough about it\nSo I think that there is something really powerful about the fact that she is speaking up now that she's speaking up after you know playing this important role in a sexual harassment lawsuit that she won last year I think that she really has come out with her political views in a way that is\nPowerful and is thoughtful and I think that you have to take a holistic view when you're looking at this and that was Rolling Stone reporter tests
