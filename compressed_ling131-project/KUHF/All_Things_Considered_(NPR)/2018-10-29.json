Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so there are something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nUh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five\nThousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more card there are barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week oh there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or the wrong way to support role again and plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWill some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms

dozen package bombs too high profile Democrats critics of President Trump and CNN made his first court appearance today fifty six year old she's our say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted Danny Rivera from member station WNPR and was in the courtroom and joins us from Miami Hi Danny\nHey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us what happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk I'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti Democrat pro Trump's and anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bail because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan jumpsuit\nHe didn't say much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all or was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield him from from the view and once I started happening\nI'm the judge us in the series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of nodded I mean he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and uh\nYeah and ...\nSorry about that um ... you could see you could see he was upset at some point you his face kind of turn red who was tearing up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too\nWell and and this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not where's trials going to take place explained that [noise]\nYeah so the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York um he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original I'm hearing is taking place but he will at some point be taken up to to New York\nOr the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs were mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nUm the the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there is no plea deal\nI'm In the meantime the next hearing the the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so he'll be you're here at least until then and at that point we'll learn whether he'll be released on bail\nOr if he's going to be transferred up to New York for for more hearings\nRight that is Danny Rivera reporter with member station WFCR in in South Florida thanks very much

Shapiro we're learning more today about the man who's believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie ... which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe them as very quiet very isolated lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he used the PO box for not the sort of a mail box set his apartment which is just south of synagogue [noise]\nBut I spoke to a friend of his has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm Robert Bowers as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle which social cues and the two of them were friends and they play together they would build things together they would take things apart [noise]\nThey would build bombs together and sort of pranks and blow up watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart\nRubber hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappear and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this and what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue and the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name\nThat he was pretty much go she would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\nAnd there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line ... about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year she spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nNeeded a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like minded community\nOn Gabrielle crucial media network that has become more popular among All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are on ... in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his anger\nAnd he seems to me that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed his hateful views\nOr whether she just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think ... is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks and then a couple of months as investigators going into his past [noise]\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about having his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did she become as hateful as he did and how long I've been going on and what role did Internet playing\nTo the current for political anger and conflict playing uh so\nI Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through his whole they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends kind of thing\nBut Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers v accused synagogue shooter thank you very much thank you\nPresident Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop\nCritics of the president say his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey they're allowed so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did with condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nShe says\nShe doesn't have a lot more than she does that I have no\nAnswers that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calls you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so it will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes\nOr the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nBut the real work was here insider office\nThat almost feels like a ... statement for the ... it is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust the reader to get it ... you know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is\nI Know that's true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether American lives or dies\n[noise] I have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy [noise]\nSo what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when you can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's just a few shed everything that happened before right\nI mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt does and it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage it's about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be\nAnd that's why it takes time because it's it is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to be and I was fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all\nIt's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't have it together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what the couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leads them through for example throughout the book to show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\nAnd as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way\nI said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself\nIt's the marriage itself and the marriage scouts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the ... changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriage as as something that they built over time that's very important and its allies in a way this different from each of them\n[noise] marriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties your health has clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters well\nI mean you're absolutely right in my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of transnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro an important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together\nDo you think every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years [noise] but I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay\nI mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you\n[noise] well ... thank you so much for talking with us about your book well thank you so much this was
