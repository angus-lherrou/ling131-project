trying to repeal Obamacare but as election day approaches Republicans are fighting back NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has more\nDemocrat Antonio Delgado has put up more than a dozen ads on his YouTube page since the start of October and the overwhelming majority all but one mentioned health care\n... wearing a fulfilling\nThe health care I mess three years cancer survivor I'm so happy you're going to fight the fight for us\nAnd he's in a tight race in New York's nineteenth congressional district and his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced in fact more than half of pro democratic TV ads in the home stretch to election day have mentioned health care compared to around one third of Republican ads\nThat's according to the Wesleyan Media project Margie Omero is a democratic pollster\nDemocrats have a very clear advantage on health care and not only that it's one of the top issues of voter saying not heard of that that they think is a big issue is facing them personally and facing the country\nThat's a big change from the twenty ten and twenty fourteen midterms when Republicans slammed Obamacare Democrats barely touched the topic\nBut since twenty sixteen Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare\nAnd the law has gained popularity now Republicans have ramped up their own messaging among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks one from Republican John ... whom Delgado is trying to unseat the ad features fast those wife a cancer survivor\nJohn firsthand how important health care's or family the truth is he voted to guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting condition this is one of\nA recent crop of ads were GOP candidates promise to protect people with preexisting conditions President Trump has been saying the same thing but then the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage that's according to the Kaiser Family foundation Larry Levitt\nInsurers would have still had the guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting condition but for people who are uninsured and had a pre existing condition they might have food prohibitively high premiums which would have coverage of the way out of reach\nAccording to a September ... from Kaiser even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections however let it points out a flipside to the policy\nWhen you see a a guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions premiums to go up especially for people who are helping\nAnd this has long been part of the Republican argument that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and furthermore force people to get insurance they didn't want however there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining for example the finer points of pre existing conditions and there is a good reason for that\nThere are a truism and politics that if you're winning or losing\nMichael Steele is a Republican strategist it's not the Republicans have been dodging healthcare this year rather they have other lines of attack perhaps the biggest single payer health care often known as Medicare for all\nI think Republicans feel the grown or or Medicare for all without a realist wind up for it all go you know ... an opportunity you know one talking to a lot of voters were going to make up their minds right now\nWhile these arguments are being used to motivate voters to turn out on election day the reality is that the election probably won't do much to settle the debate\nDanielle Kurtzleben NPR News\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nYou're listening to all things considered here on news eighty eight seven I'm Laurie Johnson the executive producer for news and I'm here with Lisa shoe made our general manager and if you've been listening to news idiots Evans national coverage of the midterms\nIncluding races here in Texas\nWe hope you'll support measured fact based reporting with a contribution right now maybe it's ten twenty or thirty dollars a month as a sustained her by the way today is also community partner day with our new friends from a essay they engage kids in music lessons and performance all over the Houston area\nSo a special way for you to support Houston Public media and also support kids on their musical journey today\nThat's right and you know this is so important because we know you lift us up and we want to lift up other organizations by working with them to get the word out about what they do and in this case actually\nInvesting in the future artist that may emerge from Houston that's what you can do with your gift right now a hundred dollars gets you one less than five hundred dollars a lesson for five children and so on\nAnd join in this absolutely outstanding community partnership with a FA Houston at eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media doubt or\nA man that he is co with a essay is here with us Amanda you're the program manager for this program a essay first tell us a little bit about how this works what this does what when people are signing up and making this donation to eastern public media and then offering this music lesson what are they activating\nSo ... has been around for about twenty five years now as a first is our newest program I'm In is allowing us to get our younger students and beginning students and to have their first music lessons so we are committed to providing access for all different kinds of students from all over the city\nTo be able to learn piano or violin or singing acquire a as a start so that if they love music they can have a pathway to the other half a programs or elsewhere later in life so what happens\nAfter they take that music lesson well they actually are in lessons for at least the semester and so they learn the basics of their instrument or reading music\nAnd then they go from there they build on their skills so that they can become confident musician and work on their self confidence\nAs well so you're\nOpportunity right now to support news and information here on Houston Public media\nAnd also to provide a music lessons for a child in our community and you know Lisa you your daughter is a professional musician I'm sure you remember when you find her up for music lessons and what a difference that made it sparked something in her\nIt absolutely sparks something in her because\nAgain she was a good student is smart students but what made her excited about going to school where the music lesson and being in the band and the community that she felt with other musicians her age and you know from age for when she picked up the guitar and to this day she is still\nMusic as her love and her life so I think it's really important for students who\nMight not be able to get access to this otherwise right we were fortunate to go to schools were music was there an available that isn't always the case and so I feel like this is something you can do right now to\nChange that you can bridge that gap for some child out there when you call right now eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org and the donation amount\nEven just a hundred dollars provides that one lesson so act now and to make the gift of music possible for someone out there\nThere are ... you mentioned that the you know for some kids don't go to schools where that's offered or for some families that just may think that's out of our reach how are we going to own a piano\nHow are we going to purchase a violin how are we going to pay for music lessons that is where organizations like a F a step in\nAnd that's where you step and so when you make your donation to support the news and information here at Houston Public media instead of choosing a traditional thank you get like a mug or the Houston Public media thoughts instead you choose a essay and we will use that portion that would have gone to the gift to provide that music lesson\nToday is also community partner day with our new friends from a essay they engage kids in music performance all over the Houston area\nLisa ... is here with me and we're excited to have this opportunity to help you support news and information in Houston and support music lessons for kids in Houston we're\nSo excited because of course when you're supporting news eighty eight seven your NPR News station you're not only supporting a source of news and discussion but you're also supporting arts and culture\nThere's many stories that fall under that mission pillar and so it seems so fitting that our community partners today would be a F. A.\nUm because what they're able to do is ignite the love of music and learning music in a child by offering a lesson you can own some of that right now when you forego your thank you gifts so works like this\nYou donate a hundred dollars\nThan a child gets there first lessons five hundred dollars you're going to do one lesson for five children so we're trying to reach as many people as possible and then you know introduce him to something they would not have access to otherwise see how powerful you your gift can be the difference you can make for the station you love\nAnd for a child who would love to learn music\nJust give us a call at eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or Houston Public media dot org\nAmanda he's co is here with us from a essay and I'm into you know one of the things I've been wondering about is how did these lessons work is is a group lesson as this one on one training for a child can what is the child going to experience when they get this lesson\nSo with a first with their beginning lessons there and group lessons or in a small choir so our piano and violence students are grouped together and classes of no more than four at a time and so what that does this help them learn the skills that they need to learn the instrument and re music\nBut also they're able to play in a group together which is really great for camaraderie but also to learn teamwork and to learn to play or singing an ensemble which is a great skill to really work on early on and there are in their musical past\nAnd what kind of children or you reaching or you know what the demographics are reaching and also I mean are these children that are expressing interest in music or is it kind of\nThe whole spectrum of I've never picked up an instrument before in my life or I've always wanted to play\nReally we have the full spectrum every kind of kid you can think of is an F a kid\nUm for our beginner lessons you know sometimes it's because the kid has expressed interest to their parents are often their younger siblings of students and our other programs that we have for older kids um\nThey're even kids who are in those other programs who are also wanting to learn affect an instrument or do something in addition to what they have already studied so and demographically we have kids from all over the entire city of Houston every type of kids you can think of\nAnd yes you can ask Amanda\nA question I'm as I'm thinking about this because you know people are really wanting to know when they're investing you were in a\nFake id either this is not a new a nonprofit no air thing has been around for almost twenty five years now I was a student in our summer music festival a during high school and it really changed my life I Love music I knew I wanted to\nPursue music um but then I showed up at a FAA we're all of these other kids who loved music as much as I did\nWere there with this amazing faculty and supportive environment\nAnd it changed my life I'm so proud that I'm able to help carry that on you can help carry that on as well when you make your gift right now by calling eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or go on line and choose a FA as your thank you gift at Houston Public media dot\nOrg when you open your door to trick or treaters next week odds are you will see a witch or two in Romania you do not have to wait for Halloween but the which is there are all about the trick not treat Joanna Kakissis reports\nIt's impossible to miss this which has how in the village of ... for starters there's a big poster up her right outside it reads the most powerful which from Europe Mick Hi Kayla main cut [noise]\nTo walk through a needed curtains and introduces herself\nYou'll be in ...

uncertainty about global economic growth and didn't forecast from corporate earnings\nHow else might investigators try to establish whether these devices are linked we we know that they arrived in different locations along the east coast\nYeah so um every bomber makes things a certain way or you know ... ... you can see that same components being used\nOr sometimes they're tool marks sometimes there'll be fire fibers in there sometimes you might even get DNA or a fingerprint um you know it looks like in some of the photos I've seen on the Internet that uh uh the address was printed out and um the FBI will be able to compare those to see if a similar device was used\nSo I ... I feel confident that there'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be can you link it back to a person or persons unknown and I know they're really looking at how are these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that fact does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still routine fingerprints for example\nAbsolutely and that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another uh explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this'll be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be in the mail not yet there are delivered we saw this in central Texas recently were devices we are going over time\nAlright that's David shipment former special agent for the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives thank you very much for coming in today Republicans and Democrats don't agree on much these days that they had all felt the pain of the nation's opioid epidemic\nLast year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose\nOpioids were responsible for about two thirds of those stats and the White House today President Trump signed legislation that will allow lawmakers from both parties to say they are taking steps to address the problem NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nThe opioid bill was passed by both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval level of bipartisan support that Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio says is unusual in today's highly polarized political climate\nI guess maybe because the severity of the crisis and particularly in states like mine of people are willing to work together and joined hands and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nDemocratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire agrees the opioid crisis cuts a wide and deadly swab from rural areas to big cities and polls show it's the rare issue that voters in both parties are alarmed by\nWe are losing over a hundred people a day in the United states of America to this epidemic you can go anywhere in the country and talked all about the impact it had on them this is impacting gay people in all walks of life in all different ways\nThe opioid built signed by the President's Day aims to address the problem in different ways targeting both supply and demand President Trump signed the bill with some fanfare and the White House ... almost exactly a year after he declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency\nTogether we're going to end the scores of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible\nTerrible problem lots of politicians are claiming credit after the bill signing as the measure incorporates lots of different ideas efforts to interdict drugs at the border for example and to increase support for drug users seeking treatment\nWhat the bill doesn't include is a whole lot of new money to fight the problem hasn't says lawmakers have approved some six billion dollars to combat opioid addiction over the next couple of years\nBut experts in the field tell us that is not nearly enough we have to treat this as a starting point we have a lot more work to do\nPortman wants to see more effort to address over prescribing opioids knowing that many addicts start out with a legitimate need for pain pills but yeah it's despair also plays a role\nOr to the answer to this is to get people who are in places like small town Ohio of rural Appalachian more opportunities that is I think one of the antidote to the drug issue more broadly\nHealth secretary Alex days are said this week there are some encouraging signs of the epidemic may be leveling off or at least not growing as rapidly as it once was\nBut drug addiction remains an elusive and evolving problem overdose deaths from heroin and prescription drugs may be near their peak but Portman says methamphetamine is regaining a foot hold and cocaine is making a comeback as well\nYou know it's a societal issue we have America has a bigger drug problem that other countries are not just opioid tore by far lead the world and we need to focus on that broader issue\nFor now though today's bill signing gives members of Congress something they can point to when confronted with the pain of the drug epidemic back home\nScott Horsley NPR News the White

Chang Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman made his first public comments today on the killing of journalists Jamal ...\nGymnast\nSpeaking at a conference in ... the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killing prompted many western CEOs to canceled their plans to attend this high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance but\nMany of us business executives did show up\nAnd to find out more about what had happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me to talk about what this conferences for the Saudis want global companies to invest their money in the king and that's the basic objective right\nExactly it's the future investment initiative and it's the second year they've done it it's become known sort of colloquially as the ... in the desert a conference and a strong about three thousand people wow this week wow world\nAnd then part of the deal is Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know efforts to make Saudi Arabia for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNotice you're of course the killing of democracy oh gee cast a shadow over the conference but today the crown prince directly confront to the issue in his comments what what'd you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting but it was kind of wondering first of all whether or not you speak or not\nThere are you would address the situation and ah he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called her the heinous act and he did promise springs whoever did it to justice I think that was his attempt to try and concerns a among people from all around the world who think this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights and the sweat\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nIt was a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince you got a standing ovations um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up they who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from like ... Morgan and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the bank that some lower level executives\nBut I think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing names on their name to act by their ties are keeping their jackets buttoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot these\nWere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense of people that I spoke to\nThat you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and I didn't want us our relations with the Saudis I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be noticed or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive they were going to get the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the kingdom\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks and biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away because of the potential damage those brand as well as companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know\nEthical investing the defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference I think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and this is such a important market for them to be involved in I think it was a drama series and just for the subway\nThat's Allan rubber parts of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today thank you for

repeal Obamacare but as election day approaches Republicans are fighting back NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has more\nDemocrat Antonio Delgado has put up more than a dozen ads on his YouTube page since the start of October and the overwhelming majority all but one mentioned health care\nThat we're in a different fulfillment we've got to figure out there I have three years cancer survivor I'm so happy you're going to fight the fight for us\nIt's even a tight race in New York's nineteenth congressional district and his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced in fact more than half of pro democratic TV ads in the home stretch to election day have mentioned health care compared to around one third of Republican ads\nThat's according to the Wesleyan Media project Margie Omero is a democratic pollster\nDemocrats have a very clear advantage on health care and not only that it's one of the top issues that are saying that er that that they think is a big issue is facing them personally and facing the country\nThat's a big change from the twenty ten and twenty fourteen midterms when Republicans slammed Obamacare\nDemocrats barely touched the topic\nBut since twenty sixteen Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare\nAnd the law has gained popularity now Republicans have ramped up their own messaging among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks one from Republican John fast so whom Delgado is trying to unseat the ad features fast those wife a cancer survivor\nJohn firsthand how important health care's her family the truth is he voted to guarantee covers for people with preexisting condition this is one of\nThe reason crop of ads were GOP candidates promised to protect people with pre existing conditions President Trump has been saying the same thing but then the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage that's according to the Kaiser Family foundation Larry Levitt\nInsurers would have still have the guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions but for people who are uninsured and had a pre existing condition they might have faced prohibitively high premiums which would have put coverage of the way out of reach\nAccording to a September ... from Kaiser even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections however let it points out a flipside to the policy\nYou see a guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions premiums go up especially for people\nAnd this has long been part of the Republican argument that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and\nFurthermore force people to get insurance they didn't want however there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining for example the finer points of pre existing conditions and there is a good reason for that\nThere are a truism and politics that if you're winning or losing\nMichael Steele is a Republican strategist it's not the Republicans have been dodging healthcare this year rather they have other lines of attack perhaps the biggest single payer health care often known as Medicare for all\nI think Republicans feel that they're grown or or Medicare for all without a real is one of the oh you know ... an opportunity you know one talking to a lot of voters were going to make up their minds right now\nWhile these arguments are being used to motivate voters to turn
