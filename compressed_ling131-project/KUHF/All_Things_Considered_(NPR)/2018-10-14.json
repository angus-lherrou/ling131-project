a woman given Fifteen Years in prison for crimes committed by former boyfriend\nThen friday Netflix Davies the second season of it hit true crime program making a murder here to talk with us about these project is NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans Hey Eric huh\nAll right let's talk about the sentence first this was filmed over a ten year period by Rudy van ... says he's the brother of the woman sentenced whose name is Cindy shank how does this show expose issues in the criminal justice system\nWell first I got to say I've been reviewing TV for a long time I was crying by the end of this I mean it the sentences the surprisingly emotional story about a couple of things mandatory minimum sentencing and prosecuting people for crimes committed by their romantic partners so\nValdez his sister Cindy was in this relationship with this guy who was involved in drug dealing and he got killed\nAnd it's six years later after she's married she's had three kids federal authorities arrest prosecute and convict or on conspiracy charges so and the mandatory minimum sentence for that was Fifteen Years now we've got a clip of Cindy describing what it was like to face that sentence let's check it out\nMarshall fed to take on my wedding ring\nThat's where I felt like I got a ... not going\nTo take my daughter\nAt forever\nSo her brother Rudy Valdez a documented the struggle for the family to cope and so we see her kids grow up over nearly a decade we see Cindy move to a prison far away from her family and then there's this emotional twisted and that just drives home how much she's lost over all this time\nIn that clip we just heard she says she's guilty\nShe's guilty of knowing about the crimes that um her boyfriend was committing and not calling the cops are you know doing something to try and stop it having knowledge of a crime a can mean that you're part of the conspiracy to commit a crime\nAnd this Friday the second season of making a murderer is debuting the first season was such a hit tell us about the second season\n[noise] so the first season a exposing mission to the story of Stephen Avery who's this guy in Wisconsin and he was exonerated in two thousand and three by DNA evidence after serving almost Twenty years for sexual assault and attempted murder\nThen he gets arrested and convicted of committing a different murder or a few years later along with his nephew who's named uh Brendan Bessie so the first season raises some doubts about the evidence that they collected against Avery\nAnd expose allegations that the nephews confession was unfairly coerced this season is about every appeal of his conviction and efforts ... to have his confession thrown out\n... it sounds very like getting into the nitty gritty of the legal process\nWell I think that's one reason why the show might be less than Paxil because it's a more mundane story about how tough it is to appeal these kinds of convictions\nDid you find a link between the two documentaries\nYeah I I think they both trying to humanize people who've been convicted of crimes and show the really brutal impact of these really long prison sentences I mean we're incarcerating a tremendous amount of people in this country for long stretches of time sometimes for non violent crimes\nAnd it's valuable to have a high profile TV project but just kind of reminds us of the

looking around Mexico beach in Panama City with entire blocks of houses leveled it's hard to imagine how anyone who did stay survived and authorities fear that the death toll rises the search

predicts the actual cost of hurricane Michael will be substantial but it's not expected to be more than ... companies can bear that's always a possibility with these huge powerful storms\nPresident Trump is planning to campaign more campaign rallies this week the latest in a long list as he tries to get support for Republican candidates around the country ahead of the midterms his rallies are designed to rally his base but are they working NPR's Mara Liasson has more\nWe'll know after November six that's a really important data point because midterms are often a referendum on the president and his party and that is a role that Donald Trump has embraced more than any other president he goes out tells his supporters at these rallies he says I'm not on the ballot but I Am on the ballot so go out and cast a vote for me\nAnd here's Mara Liasson this week Trump plans to campaign and supportive jokey candidates in Montana Arizona and Nevada in Germany conservative allied with chancellor uncle America will have been dealt a major loss after elections today in the state of the area from Berlin and dear sir I as a hearty Nelson reports afar white party has benefited from voter anger\nIt's the first time in decades that the Christian social union or see a few is losing its majority rule in Bavaria\nAnd that the combined effect of the subject butter milk and the acidic\nCause of powder created a sort of density and the texture of the cake which amplified the velvet enough of it and simultaneously the the ph of the cake helped some of the color pigments in the rocket powder shine through a little bit more\nAnd so that's why the trick doesn't really work today when people say like oh well red velvet came from a reaction in the cocoa powder and you can do this at home you can't really do it at home unless you get Rocco Potter because some type of cocoa you're picking up at the store is going to be a roasted product and not raw yeah\nSo the red didn't refer to this sort of garish food color read it was just sort of like a ... brown\nYeah absolutely a there is a food scientist in the Nineteen thirties who commented on it and she called it a red brown hue and she was trying to be very clear about the reaction of what's happening that the ph of this cake batter produces a sort of reddish brown who [noise]\nUm but that's not really a very sensational story and so when newspapers are picking this up and talking about the cake because at the time the idea of a a red devil which was an alternate name for the law that cocoa cake\nUm the idea sounds great sounds read but in practice it really just distinguished the color of this light cocoa cake from the N G blackness and the devils food cake so this is a little bit more of a Depression era\nLike let's scale back here let's use 'cause of patterns that have chocolate let's use some old sour milk in the back of the fridge I ... you know pulling from these like little bit more thrifty ingredients\nAnd so it made a a little less sensational cake but in order to make a good story out of it when newspapers would cover it they definitely played up the red aspect and kind of left off the brown aspect\nAnd then sooner or later people wanted to read because we keep hearing that was going to read\nYeah there's a recipe from like the Nineteen forties\nAnd it had like four ounces of red food coloring in there which isn't you know a quarter of a cup of Petro chemicals it's pretty scary [laughter] tents that it made an outrageously colored cake and you know from their red velvet really did take off because obviously that's a very eye catching thing\nSo tell me about your recipe for red velvet cake now that you've done all this research\nWas my recipe I really wanted to get back to the ... that really you know defines the original cake and I also wanted to get back to the raw cocoa powder which is a really cool thing that we can source now on you know what type on line he's at a crab\nAnd so by they using rockets what part of the flavor comes out so much more and it's such a more interesting flavor than just a mild chocolate and I also use red wine\nTo kind of play up the fruiting us over Rocco powder and to also\nKind of like cash in on that chemical reaction that once upon a time made the reaction between Rocco powder and buttermilk so impressive\nA red wine does something really

about ... and that that area of India\nYes a ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd tell me about this ... what are these women doing\n[noise] it's a pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ...\nAnd the trains are filled with women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad that it's filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ...\nAnd the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth of three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're in how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow\nYes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the\nWay that they refer to her is to call her mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of us that this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... and um she worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... still set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift hearth with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking\n[noise] so on the morning that this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice I'm\nA dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes and the signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there speakers set out\nWomen light a fire and they all start cooking\nSo which actually really incredible about this is the smell you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut park and these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes\nAnd they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise]\n[noise] yeah and they're really cooking so tell us when it's a rice porridge yes so they basically they start off they have a clip hot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil\nFirst of all it's a cake so why do we call it a pie and second of all I don't think I've ever had a good piece of Boston cream pie\n[laughter] oh boy I'm well I guess I Am asking you to defend it well\nIt's so there you can have really good Boston cream pie I'm I'm like here it's really hard to find it out and bakeries that are good you know sometimes the cake rubbery so sweet there's so much sugar between the cake itself the sponge cake and that custard filling and then the chocolate on top\nBut the part of it that you mentioned is really interesting\nWe did a lot of research trying to find out exactly what they meant by time when I came down to what we think and what food historians have told us is that the pie plate\nWas one of the most used pieces of bakery back then so they baked everything in pi plates instead of cake pans so it was just natural to called pine\nHuh okay at least that's my story and stuff [laughter] so you guys have taken this apart and re assembled\nThis old American recipe for the home cooked\nCan you tell me what you did yeah sure at well you'd think about there's three components to Boston cream pie there's two layers of sponge cake and in between is a layer of vanilla pay strict cream so you know so far so good he's got sponge cake and got paste or cream and then they pour over this chocolate\nGlaze yeah so that should be delicious and as I've said it has not always been what did you guys do to make it friendly for home cooks what we ditched the sponge cake you did\nA traditional sponge is super finicky you take eggs either hold lay eggs or egg jokes and you beat them with sugar until their phone me and then you have to delicately fold in a flower mixture and there was a little trapped air bubbles from\nBeating the eggs and the sugar together that's the only loving that the kid gets so if you over fold into flour you're going to deflate the mixture and you're going to really kind of squat Boston cream pie very very uh rubbery at that point\nSo we switched over to something called the ... milk sponge cake which is a\nLittle bit of a Betty Draper style retro recipes it couldn't be easier to make you take milk\nA little bit of butter you heat it together until the butter melts you take some eggs and sugar and you do beat that until it's nice and fluffy but then you pour in all the ... milk mixture and then you stir in some flour a little bit of salt and baking powder and baking powder is going to make this foolproof cakes gonna rise every single time\nAnd you do two of those are you do want to cut it in half or two of those much easier to to those and then the other part of this is there's some butter and the cake that makes it more tender and less we you know traditional sponge doesn't have a lot of fat in it you need that fat to counter the sweetness\nOkay so there we have the cakes known what goes on with the cream\nAlright pastry cream there's two ways to make a traditional pastry cream again you take eggs or egg yolks and you mix it with a little bit of sugar\nAnd then you pour in hot half and half and you have to be really careful you want it to temper you want to start to feel sick and but you don't want it to colonel and you also don't want to under cook it otherwise it can be too thin and what we found\nThere's two ways to do this to start you can add is either cornstarch or flour and flour is going to make pastry cream work every single time cornstarch is one hundred percent starch and that really does have the ability to thicken very well\nBut if you don't heat the mixture enough\nThere's some inside and the egg yolk that will actually prevent the corn starch from thickening enough so you end up with a measure that's just too thin\nAnd then also if you mix a corn starch second ... a little too much it will start to thin itself you're basically breaking down the structure and there and causing some of that moisture to worry about that flour has in addition to start it has some fat some lipids and also proteins and they work as binders\nShe not only have the starch from the fire but these extra powerful binders\nThat picking the basic dream and it stays thick so it works every single time I mean pastry claimants really scary for people so it sounds like you have absolutely eliminated that issue for us and you know here's a little hint that somebody wants taught me if you pay strict cream hurdles a little bit it doesn't really matter you just pass it through find massive and nobody will\nEver [laughter] okay last but not least the chocolate place or the ...\nThe easy ones so a lot of chocolate places are made from chocolate and heavy cream and you poured over the cake that can be kind of dull the original recipe the Boston cream pie that was made the park or house hotel in Boston back in the Eighteen fifty\nThey mix chocolate with a fond of extra so basically they boiled um water and sugar together until they got to the softball stage a little bit of cream in there too\nAnd then added the chocolate and it makes it very brittle almost like candy\nWe wanted something of a slice of all it was thick enough to cling to the cake and not just all poor down into the serving dish but also stay nice and stuff will be fair shiny and the key to that is just a little bit of corn syrup a little bit of corn syrup just gives it that flexibility and shy and like a\nFreshly polish pair of black pat and shoes\nHaven't really the message to find this one um is this one of those cakes pies that is better after a day's raft absolutely actually\nThe whole cake can be made over a few days they can be made a couple of days in advance patriot cream can be made also in a couple of days in advance so he didn't want to put together this whole thing in one day that's fine\nBut after you put it together it really needs to refrigerate for at least three hours before you want to slight center has set up\nUm our recipe says twenty four hours in advance but it will definitely and sit there for forty eight hours at least I think cakes like that that has some pastry cream and um they're much better any kind of desserts that's really had the costs are done much better if you give it at least one day and the French\nNone of those recipes mhm Bridget thanks so much for explaining this
