things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh he is meeting with Saudi Arabia's leaders about the disappearance and likely death of journalist ... ...\n... talk to NPR earlier this year he told my colleague Jackie Northam that he was no fan of the direction crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was taking Saudi Arabia\nHe has no interest in particular the full he thinks he can do it alone and who doesn't really an a cult that opinion or do you want to share those changes associated with him\nChilling words to hear now from that interview with our international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam and Jackie is with me now to talk more about the crown prince and whether he's a reformer or not he Jackie I'm married\nSo early on a lot of people thought that he was headed down the path toward reform and the and one of the big things that was cited was his decision to allow finally Saudi women to drive people thought about what the promising and there were other moves in a similar vein right\nYeah that's right it was just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive again that ban was seen as a clear sign of repression and the kingdom\nUm he also allowed women to go to work again any open movie theaters after about a thirty year ban on that too and all of this happened very quickly at the same time his faces they were all over TV and magazines and that\nSo we see is very dynamic compared to the rest of the older Saturday leaders who are known for making a decision very slowly\nHe also has tried to open up the economy making Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil\nYes that's right yeah and and that's not going very well at all and here's where we really start to see the repressive side of the crown prince he\nWanted to make fundamental changes to the economy and quickly and it's part of that he wanted to fight corruption is a way to bring in foreign investment\nBut it was a way that he did it that's become emblematic of how he operates instead of using laws in court he rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and princes and government ministers and he held them at the Ritz Carlton hotel for more than three months until they paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get out\nNow most people would say that's probably not a good way to attract foreign investment in fact I Would probably do just the opposite which it appears to have done I'm thinking also have\nSome of his recent moves on the international stage of the war in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has carried out a ... I think largely indiscriminate bombing campaign and then there was the situation with the prime minister of Lebanon remind\nUs what he has a minister Saad Hariri ah he was visiting and Saudi Arabia and he was detained by the crown prince of think about it to a painting of sitting prime minister or well he's visiting your country and that's how I built him a reputation for being reckless in a bully and many of the analysts that I've talked to over the past few months\nThinks this is because he just doesn't think through or recognize the repercussions of what he's doing 'em and perhaps he doesn't have a great world view and you know he ... he didn't travel abroad very much unlike most other Saturday elites and so perhaps he doesn't have a keen sense of geopolitics\nCircle back to that tape if your interview with ... where he said he doesn't think the crown prince really wants to encounter opinion\nIs a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually all over the many months now I he's rounded up for religious figures economists activists including those who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned\nAnd he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um and that included from ... you know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and what are they ready to come here had to you know he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened his suspected murder\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very with NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close adviser and son in law drink pushing her time with the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe\nUs more about ... role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person or since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties\nAnd there I was obviously and both both and very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared in America there is such a hidden\nGenius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not\nHappy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nFor now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today was Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on\nAfter ... showed gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of caution there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nAh to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nSenator it can't be hiding nominees records they shouldn't be ending debate prematurely they shouldn't be rubber stamping these jak history or they need to hold hearings on the than it is in fashion and and not be jamming three controversial judges for\nPresident Trump there's a lot more work to do to reshape the courts\nBy the time we finish maybe fifty percent of the court you know what that is fifty per se\nAnd those judges will serve long after this president leaves the White House Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington among the revelations\nOf the interview that President Trump just gave to sixty minutes\nThat hanging on the walls of the White House the president has placed a picture of himself in the company of past Republican presidents some of them sit at a table in a crowded room there are drinks looks like Trump is drinking Diet Coke and they all seem to be laughing I\nReagan Teddy Roosevelt both bushes Ford Nixon and Lincoln it's called the Republican club and it was painted by Andy Thomas who joins me now from Springfield, Missouri Andy Thomas welcome well thank you for having me when you first find out that you're painting was hanging in the White House\nIt was Sunday night I finally settled down and was watching the football game and Dina had checked her a social media and dean is your wife Dena as my wide okay so I actually my phone's been ringing quite a bit it was reporters but I thought it was a robo calls wasn't answering\nPlus you're in the middle of a football game so there is more important stuff going on that's right and you started learning that the ... the Republican club which you'd painted it had been hung by President Trump who who's at some point called you himself what happened\nWell Daryl ISIS who's become a friend to deny it's just a Congressman Darrell Issa yes from California he had told us early in the summer that he was going to try to be as simple and he would show the painting to President Trump\nAnd apparently he had told Dina that he had a five o'clock appointment so Dina sent me a text and just said you need to be around the house around four o'clock four o'clock central time she didn't tell you what you know\nSo I was I was out mowing the lawn I came in had clippings all over\nI came in I said well what what I Need to be around for and she said well Daryl showing the painting to the president\nAnd I thought that's a long shot I'll just wait a few minutes and go finished alone but they indeed did call and was very gracious and what did he say what it what about the painting he's a tough man paint and I so I can under sympathize with this he said I've seen a lot of paintings of me and\nI've really usually don't like them but I really like this one huh I didn't bother to tell them that I painted as faced two or three times you know the\nWhite yeah he's a hard man to paint how come\nWell like my family has dark eyebrows dark eyes you know there's something to grab a hold of with a President Trump you know his hair in his face in his eyebrows you know there is no dark you know so it was a challenge and and getting the right smile\nI I don't think I'd be offending anyone if I'd pointed out that he looks a little bit slimmer and the painting than he perhaps [laughter] well no wonder he liked it\nThat's true but several years ago this was the third version of this these paintings that I've done\nAnd I decided on the very first one that I Would try to make each man is good looking as I could still be recognizable and so I I fried or immoral if I can come because when I Do it when I even did a self portrait one time I looked like Clark Gable when I got into\nIt just you know there's just an inclination is to you know I like people don't want to point out flaws in them\n[noise] I Need to ask you about something going on in this in this painting it look as though President Trump is grinning at something that Abe Lincoln and sing to him you can't quite tell but you can just see you see Lincoln and ... what we're talking about\nI Would like to believe that Lincoln was using that great with that he had in his told her you know some insightful thing that was funny and Donald Trump is responding to it and everybody you know try to have the whole table involved in the conversation or the the the feeling the moment\nThat Andy Thomas he painted the Republican club which features the

over the Sears catalog I had my eye on highly hobby often and\nAside from the fact that you could make cakes and what I loved about shopping from the Sears catalog was nobody knew I was a kid that can browse that my own pace snow shop assistant ignoring me or talking over my head to my parents\nIt turns out that feeling the ability to shop without being judged resonated in a different more profound way for black Americans in the Jim Crow era Cornell historian Simon argues the Sears catalog was radical in its day\nBecause it allowed black Americans to have the same shopping experience as whites he's been pondering that legacy in light of this week's news the tears has filed for bankruptcy professor highland welcome to all things considered thank you so much for having me\nWhy was the Sears catalog such a game changer for shoppers in the Jim Crow south\nAnd the Arabs Jim Crow race was everything and for black Americans most of whom were rural farmers access to goods on an equal basis as whites in faraway cities at reasonable prices was a godsend and that's what the catalog was\nI mean from a practical point of view of what had happened previously was they would show up and they would be asked to go to the back of the line behind the white customers and if you're shopping back catalog nobody knows what color you are\nNobody knows who you are and in the era of Jim Crow there was a constant active differences you're black you had to wait until all the white customers were served you had to wait until the white store owner let you buy whatever you want it and he may or may not have let you 'cause it was largely on credit\n[noise] so the Sears catalog appears people could read it at home they could decide what they wanted to order but there were still challenges right meant southern store owners fought back\nOh definitely because if you were an African American and he wanted to shop and some other way you are contesting their power and not just the power of the store owner and the power the landlord but basically the power of white supremacy of Jim Crow itself\nAnd so you had lots of store owners pushing back you know burning catalogs and the street very publicly from Sears catalog and burning Sears catalog and bond fires in the streets all kinds of incentives to destroy these catalogues\n[laughter] so what did you do to keep all their customers are able to order their products\nWell he published instructions in the catalog how to simply give the requirements to the post men so you didn't have to go through the story and a lot of places\nThe post office was also the general store so it was pretty complicated even get your order submitted to the catalog but they found lots of ways to do this for rural African Americans as well as immigrants people who didn't even speak English they had all kinds of clerks available to take your order and nearly any tongue\nSo your takeaway is what that this is a reflection on on buying power on retail as as resistance yeah\nI think it's a story of a deep contradiction between Jim Crow and consumer capitalism that you can see in lots of places particularly in this moment in near around Nineteen hundred but also later in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as African Americans acquire were buying power\nThis is part of the demand for civil rights that African Americans could use buses and restaurants in toilets and theaters and everything else that's part of consumer capitalism that this is one of the essential writes a very conservative right of American Capitalism [noise]\nWho Simon he teaches

middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical one\nAnd candidates dying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nServing up their meanwhile Harris his opponent as his Republican rival Santa's on his way to the panhandle to help out all in tears\nBy the next several weeks no more than\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at sea bass gay welcome to the program thank you so much as hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect in the governor's race of the race to the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor is the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm\nAnd the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency to sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a ... first lady\nHas stepped into the role that is very unusual\nAnd I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee Rick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaigning\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month's October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like they county which is the hardest hit comedy of the ball and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governors Scott issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but every one vote would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on them and I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls but hurricane Michael ...\nIt's a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which was of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nOr despite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy\nWhat a hurricane does to alter the dynamics politics and campaigning is it reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're great ... of the ... are getting ... first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government trying to give people a you know oh\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on politics in Florida ... thanks so much sex where all these\nObamacare won't be on ballots in next month's elections but the fate of the eight year old health care law and other ambitious healthcare initiatives could be decided depending on which party wins control of Congress NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City or telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign\nAd I don't talk about it much but those who face cancer and many other illnesses had a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and his requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign finance out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care this year is the mirror\nImage of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active and trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization words\nYou're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nBlue Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nI think knowing that you know when it reaches in Supreme Court they won't take additional evidence so student voice that comes through here will be the only voice that they hear when it gets to the top there\nWhichever way this case ends up being decided I think that in the long term thinking about how I think I Want to get a message to future applicants that their stories matter and that

like bar was a supporter of President Trump\nConservatives and Trump himself hill the revivals blockbuster ratings as proof of their popularity but critics like Roxanne gay wrote in the New York times uh she liked the show but wouldn't watch it because it was quote normalizing Trump and his wart harmful political ideologies\nWhen bar sent a tweet in may calling a black former Obama Abe the
