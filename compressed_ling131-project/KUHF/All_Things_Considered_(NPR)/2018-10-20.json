Bush administration has tried to increase water deliveries to farmers in California's massive Central Valley project where water from snow fed reservoirs gets pumped south to arid farmland but those deliveries are perennially cut back due to attempts to protect endangered fish and drought\nThe president's order would speed up the current review of this as well as to other projects in Oregon and Washington\nIf environmental restrictions are loose and there will likely be a pro long legal battle and one of the biggest champions of this latest plan is deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt used to lobby for the Fresno based ... water district one of the largest and most influential water agencies in the west\nA pleasure thousands of Central Americans mostly from Honduras are stuck on Guatemala's border with Mexico they are part of a so called caravan of folks who hope to\nUs border and eventually into the U.S reporter Emily Green has been traveling with him and she's now on the bridge that separates quarter mile or from Mexico and she's with us now Emily thanks so much for talking to us thanks for having a little bit more about where you are and what's happening right now\nSo I'm On this bridge a set up right spot on Mexico and what I'm saying right now our babies just in their diapers kids without shoes on tons of men and moms it feels like I'm In the midst of a humanitarian crisis\nCan you just tell us a bit more about what people are telling you who they are and why they've been willing to go through all this so most of them\nCame from Hunter S and there are so ah folks from El Salvador and some from Guatemala but the vast majority of them ... would they told me largely is that this wasn't planned they read or heard about the caravan\nAnd conditioned and Honduras are bad that they can't get gas that there's no food that they're they're simply\nStarving and that they had to take a chance they also felt much safer and numbers to travel to Mexico as part of a big group of people instead of just a loan or paying a smuggler or coyote to take them\nNow I understand that a number of people were actually turning back now that's right so Guatemala has sent buses to take a those migrants who want to return to Honduras to take them back voluntarily and so I talked to a woman by the name of Rosalind Lopez is in a as she's twenty six years old\nShe said like many of the other migrants that she started to join the care benefits and company decision but but she regretted that decision along the way\nShe has four children back in Honduras and she said she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than she imagine\nThose that are in the ... the not so she says to me she'll suffer back and then dressed but at least she'll keep her life and she refers to the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas\nAgainst migrants tried them into Mexico and that people got hurt and so she says given these conditions it's better that she returned to Honduras\nBut you said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and move on keep moving with the caravan\nThat's right up and for the point I mean I'd say there's maybe two to three thousand people on the spread most of them are moving forward I talked to a twenty four year old Kevin how dumb India he's traveling with his younger sister and a friend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrant 'em and they want to reach Florida\nWith their friends here's what he had to tell me you know that there would have been told me he says the Europe becomes your friends so few becomes scared you use that fear to your favor\nAnd it pushes you forward and he says we're going to try and get across Mexico anyway they pan and that includes by boat or trying to cross the bridge that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this he's been speaking about it a campaign rally demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claims will send us troops to the southern border I I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what sense do you have from all the both of Margaret sending authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on the spread really know what Trump is saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically word of mouth they know Trump doesn't want them they absolutely know that but that's almost meaningless to them what they want to do is leave\nTheir lives they're they're very far they're very violent life behind in ... so they're going to push forward\nBut I have to send today on the bridge that this is not going to end well I don't have the sense that all of a sudden Mexico is going to let these three thousand people in 'em and so it makes me wonder what's gonna happen\nTo them that this is this is going to turn for them to a humanitarian crisis where these people are going to go I don't think it's going to end well\nEmily Green is a reporter based in Mexico and she's with us now from the bridge that separates Mexico from Guatemala with thousands of would be migrants are gathered hoping to cross Emily

attacks us lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she needed a Kobe with observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that there's a clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds that sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things\nYou might not ever example Gino how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nMinors classmate Devin Lewis says he could relate to stars reluctance to speak up\nShe wants to talk but she can't 'cause she just doesn't have the voice yet
