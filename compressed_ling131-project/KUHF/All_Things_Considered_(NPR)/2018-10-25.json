Sarah Sanders rejected the idea that Trump's no holds barred approach to politics might contribute to a hostile climate and the country\nYou guys continue to focus only on the negative and there is a role to play yesterday the very first thing that the president did was come out and condemned the violence the very first thing your network did was come out and accused the president of being

also because his audience the American people are hard wired rejected\nThat moved to tribalism in this moment is suggestive of deep measures that are making it harder to do things that have unify the

would be bomber or mystery Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\n...\n\nThe death of journalists ... has strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and its stirred up rivalries in the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians and the Turks\nTurkey has been strategic and dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also is playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S at its they've been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues um but you know is ... ... is working with Washington on this particular event\nAnd the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on different sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how majority Muslim countries are governed they favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Saudis the U H E the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail and so for for turkey it it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into\nThis story if at all oh they've been very quiet um and in the first two weeks said nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we'd be done to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how in the century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weak and they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon and they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and away right I mean the Saudis backed the president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran um what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfolds here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap\nThat's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity and they have said that they will make up any deficit in Iranian crude and cheap oil prices steady now so far\nUh Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those caps this all begins on November fifth\nAnd November fifth what's the significance of that date November fifth is when the U.S sanctions go into effect that is when it will become very difficult for the Iranians to sell any of their oil on the global market That's NPR's Deb Amos thanks so much for explaining it thank you

NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages have been intercepted so far the packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now\nAnd the story is put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city allows either we don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages of what's known so far but how that were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation are for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service or the packages addressed for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance were flagged and mail screening facilities by the secret service to the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also founding postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because us yes has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like\nThis when it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening procedures\nSo it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance or maybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we're talking about\nA period of ... up and sent using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nAt the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that the deal with that can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own mail\nOn the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have cars can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect the the the U.S postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective a specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into a hazardous material that could be\nOh a weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics a is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nUh not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now ah I talked with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials and the media members in the case of CNN who seem to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who are putting danger who were carrying backpacks pointed to point B were also in danger in these situations\nUh if you remember back to two thousand and one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are going to change but we're definitely seeing people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much thank you\n[noise] you're listening to news eighty eight seven I'm Laurie Johnson and the clock is ticking on the Houston Public media fall fundraising campaign\nWe've

... has strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and its stirred up rivalries in the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians and the Turks\nTurkey has been strategic dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also was playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S it it may have been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues\nUm but you know Istanbul Ankara is working with Washington on this particular event and the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on different sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how\nMajority Muslim countries are governed they favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Saudis the UAE eat the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail and so for for turkey it it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into\nThis story is at all oh they've been very quiet um and and the first two weeks had nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we began to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how in the century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weekend they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the
