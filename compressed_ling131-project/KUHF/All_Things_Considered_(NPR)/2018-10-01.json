I wanted to stop and hide and he looked up and notice that we are standing right in front of two jet fuel tanks\nAnd he said at that moment um we had to get away from the is because these get shot it's just over it's going to blow up and then the ironic thing of all that was the shooter did in deep shoot those um those fuel tanks and thankfully they didn't ignite and that's another thing that I just think like what if what if that would have happened 'cause that would have been\nHow you could have been standing at the front you could have stayed behind these gas tanks which will it but you're telling the story now and you're sounding incredibly calm but you must have had plenty of time to reflect on the fight lock going on\nRight now I'm struggling a year later with more than other emotions as um you know even to the point with the like hearing the bullet whizzing by like if we would have taken a step to the right strain that bullet whizzing by her head or\nTo the left or I'm been standing you know two feet close or what would have happened and why were we spared and other people were because it was just too many weird coincidences it may may be saved our lives but it didn't say those people live so\nThat's a little bit of a struggle a year later that I'm having more than I was initially right afterwards because I just feel like we had a lot of tense things happens at what against ah the normal odd that we you know the normal things that that weekend and\nHow have you tried to coax since it happened\nOne of the main things that really helped me was our city got an a hockey team this past year or the first year and our hockey team did an amazing they made it all the way to the\nStanley Cup and they really healed city and in a way which is that they know very strange but they just really made our city be able to focus on something positive and they embrace the situation and they always that up for\nUm for the city and for what we went through and always honored are survivors and the people that were the victims of the shooting set that was also strangely healing for me\nI'm of course one of the reasons that so many people died was because the ... the shoe to\nUsed bump stocks these devices which essentially a semi automatic rifle into into a machine gun into a fully automatic rifle just wanna play you something today because President Trump was asked about the ... the plan to to ban bump stocks at a at a news conference ... some of listen to what do you have to say\nSo in order to eliminate terminated bumps out we have to go through a procedure of we are now with the final stages of that proceed in fact the lawyers were just telling me and over the next couple of weeks I'll be able to read that but you can't just write it up because\nRules and regulations in this country a really tough even for something like that so we're knock it out bumps I've told the an array of do the bumps auction gun but it's a process that takes stature tour earlier takes about a year to do with\nPresident Trump saying it takes a long time when you hear and what do you think\nUm yes I get that's how things work but\nUm it seems like when lives are lost it there there should be maybe more action that they have an executive action that can be taken against things like that the bump stock thing like I mean I'm Glad that I think it's ridiculous that um that was even something that's legal or that\nWasn't not allowed before so I guess to me I I I should be a little bit more like happy about that but um to me it's a little bit of a band aid I'm a person that has a zero place for guns in my life\nYou know I I'd be happy if I Lived in a place like Australia where guns are not allowed but I understand I made the choice to live in America I Love America and I understand that we have a constitution I\nDon't understand how something like this where it's become quite a bit that mix and we were losing children how\nThings can't be looked at more logically how we can at least research it because we're literally the only country in the world that has these kind of problems\nLas Vegas shooting survivor Jill Price and\nBringing to

Liasson\nIn a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House President Trump said he successfully negotiated determination and replacement of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement he says he has a new pact that he's named the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that\nPromise some of the terms of the new agreement are

said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk but how\nIs anyone to sort this out I think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective it's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was\nTaken to the wrong ER and there's an official record of that\nThis is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we're now for three days and to the pro NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation\nDo we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they make clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope were almost inevitable a on this question a senior a set of geo PA pointed comments any Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all those allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing and I was three days so far\nWell the bureau itself has not provided any uh any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously beyond that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point\nIt also hasn't reached out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that Julie sweat neck\nA and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course his cabinet us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin us representation of his of his drinking as a young man this is Chad letting too and he has a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and ... says is that he frequently drank with Kevin ... when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin O's truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's something that\nShould be looked into it when the president says you know what I

is all things considered I Know for change and I'm Ari Shapiro\nThere have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shock there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nI found a way to write

the FBI is three days into its a week long investigation and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo understand what a supplemental pro but this type might entail we reached out to Jack ... he's a former FBI agent he's conducted plenty of background probes into federal judges and he walked me through how he would\nGo about this one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home\nPerhaps Dr Ford to ride around with agents we don't have much time and we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood or the general area and we might be able to find the house they're also real estate records available that you have to be I Would investigate\n... let me just start with the first example you would actually have Fifteen body for it in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that jaws her memory to point out to have I actually would awesome\nAnd you would try to look for what you said floor plans of houses in the neighborhood yeah matched the description from her memory\nI Would in her memory is there's a living room right inside the front door stairway up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered some written calendars from its high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOur interview everyone on the calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer or so July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nWell to do it quickly to do a polygraph of all three people involved and the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\nOkay there are allegations that involved Kavanaugh's behavior well under the influence of alcohol um during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough job of his drinking habits in high school and in college [noise]\nYes Elsa in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up the information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have said a background investigation cannot what tell me why do\nI Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's\nReally a while the staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents assigned this case agents on backgrounds are well trained who've done it many times\nIt turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on a Supreme Court does he happy I have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case that age and I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope according to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth with those additional interviews\nDo you think the idea has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes out about issues that weren't at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI could request additional time if they found new evidence new information about the why the background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the quest\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOh You're welcome Elsa thank you even as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time\nFor the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg without the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kevin questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president there sure the American people but Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBack then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued a challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis she's lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are native species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nUntil he finally get the signal is that's up shop instead on the steps that in Japan\nThe you're putting in the

over near forty years there's never been anything like it and China's new wealth and power are changing the world\nThis week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to give us a previous hey well I also\nSlanted the on the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the outside [noise]\nRight well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one economic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and\nChina's not rising anymore it's risen what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China and how did\nYou decide where to go to assess China's massive influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia and what we were looking to do is not just to sort of achieve a\nA geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies struggling societies places\nThat are very far afield generally far out of their orbits and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about this place here in the next coming days give us a fan of what you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz found a he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China necessarily have a really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China's no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into the public sphere of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you guys go well in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities now this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed\nBut it's now leading to greater local resentment added this Chinese operation using Chinese labor\nAnd there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating get traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making massive investments and these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can the devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China investing huge amounts and ports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the proceeds of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like he's surrounded and squeeze it and that way you have some control and leverage what\nAn ominous analogy in anaconda

staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen ex background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now three days and to the pro NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation\nDo we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they said at the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it almost inevitable a on this question of senior a set of GPA pointed to comments at SUNY Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend a Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kevin us friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all those allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing in those three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez uh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much credit so the bureau has not reached shut the Ford at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick\nUh and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course has Kavanaugh's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI or his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nOr but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say cabinet did not behave that way they don't match a those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin O's truthfulness about his drinking is ruthless in his testimony that it's something that\nShould be looked into and the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say NPR's
