Iran linked accounts pages and groups from Facebook and Instagram and ... so you were porch\nFacebook says the Iran linked to counts typically pretended to be us or UK citizens and shared politically charged both for example about race relations or immigration aimed at American and British audiences\nThis activity dates as far back as twenty sixteen but Facebook says it has not noticed any targeting of the midterm elections which are in ten days\nHere's Nathaniel ... had a Facebook cyber security policy\nSowing discord and it was trying to target or socially to visit issues as opposed to being specifically targeted on events that are about\nAny side at all but where I disagree with David I think he's tried to generalize too much and saying oh this is all politics there's a fundamental problem here\nWhich is the President Trump's hold on power depends on the dividing the nation it's not just that he's capable of being a United or it's a unity is a dire threat to his political standing and\nYou know at three fourteen this morning he tweeted an attack\nOn CNN and then later he sent out a tweet that complaining that this bomb stuff\nThat's his were his phrase a was hurting the Republicans in the election there's something very specific care about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support President Trump is incapable of talking out against\nHim David you want to answer that I Know parsing through the Twitter feed can take out some time but okay I Want to move on to something else then defense secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the U.S Mexico border and this is as this caravan of\n... some thousand migrants has traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now that has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants and asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think it as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the two answers they give our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come see immigration and not only as a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again that catastrophic tunes for using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores forever history as late as April\nOr some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some central threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually had easygoing\nIntimate terms what is the Democratic reply to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such try to Italy\nI think one of the difficulties here uh besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focus on this caravan because she knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base of the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they are constantly accused of being for open borders and when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for ... and and with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and thus far ... Raman ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and\nThis is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care and to the issues that a lot of voters voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead\nA that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think an integrate many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking about that\nYeah to get some credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy of big change in American identity or he plays on cultural and identity issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we can oh we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural identity critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but it ... times like this of the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump's stance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about\nA lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example to refugees and away the Trump Administration is not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a video of the

NPR\nNews New York President Trump is going after one of his most use communications platforms the president claims that Twitter has removed many people from his account even though his account chosen actual gained followers this month\nAccording to Internet Archive which looks at Web pages over time Trump at fifty four point eight million followers on October first about fifty five point three million followers as of today dropping a message they accused of micro blogging site of having seemingly done something makes it harder to join\nUS Economy stayed stronger than expected for the three months ending in September of the government announcing David Gross domestic product that's the total value of goods and services and the U.S economy was up by an annual rate of three and a half percent\nGarbage department says a dip and some exports as a result of the Trump Administration trade towers was partially offset by solve the strongest consumer spending you know upwards of four years\nStocks in the u._s. went through another volatile day of trading the markets opened with a dive and recovered slightly by the end of the day NPR's Alina Selyukh reports tech earnings cars those jitters\nIt's been a very turbulent weak on Wall street with stocks soaring one day and plummeting the next day after the bell on friday the Dow was down more than one percent the U.S and be five hundred one point seven percent and the NASDAQ more than two percent\nAnd whatever else we know about Mr ... van is plastered with pro Trump and anti liberal messages as Ryan said his Twitter feed suggests he's on the Trump side if he's on any side at all\nBut where I disagree with David I think he's tried to generalize too much and saying oh this is all politics there's a fundamental problem here\nWhich is the President Trump's hold on power depends on dividing the nation it's not just that he's in capable of being a United or it's a unity is a dire threat to his political standing in you know at three fourteen this morning he tweeted an attack\nOn CNN and then later he sent out a tweet that complaining that this bomb stuff\nThat's his were his phrase a was hurting the Republicans in the election there's something very specific here about our president and his party because it does that most of its supporters support President Trump is incapable of talking out against\nHim David you want to answer that I Know parsing through the Twitter feed can take out some time but okay I Want to move on to something else then defense secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the U.S Mexico border and this is as this caravan of\n... some thousand migrants is traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now that has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants and asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think it as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the two answers they give our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come to see immigration and not only the cultural shift but as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again the catastrophic tunes for using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April\nOr some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some central threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually\nGoing into midterms what is the Democratic reply to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried it only\n... I think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focus on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base\nOf the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they're constantly accused of being for open borders and when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for an end with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and as far as ... in ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and\nThis is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care and to the issues and a lot of voters are voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead a that's a terrible word about where they stand on health care\nOr and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think in a great many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking about that\nYeah I think at some credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy a big change in American identity or he plays on cultural and any the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural invented the critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in the times like this I think the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump loose stance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that the if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one or in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the\nElectric which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way the Democrats do I recently about a lot of Democrats and a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example to refugees and away the Trump Administration has thought but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nLet each of the owner of the Washington Post and Brookings Institution thank you so much to be with you David Brooks of the New York times have a good weekend but I Do a little\n...
