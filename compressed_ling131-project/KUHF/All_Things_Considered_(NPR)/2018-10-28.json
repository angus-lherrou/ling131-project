org\nYou know I adore Dale and it was a blast to get to hang out with her and it also\nMade me remember this thing that I realized when we were on top chef masters together\nThere's just almost fetish eyes idea of having quote a good palate right it's as if what makes you a good eater is you know the ability to detect the three ... of human in a recipe or\nThat the tomato sauces the subtle ... of ginger skin and sure yeah a sensitivity like that is all good but what I think having a good palate is really about\nIs just being able to talk about what you're tasting then you can put into words what you're tasting and I remember our producers would always say to us look you're tasting the food for the viewers so you have to tell us what it's like\nAnd I think you'd do taste differently if you're thinking about how to describe it you look for a story to tell what's the first thing that grabs your attention\nThan you think about how the flavor changes if it mellowed out or if it keeps being intense and then you start to think about other ways to describe the flavor maybe you think about it like music you talk about its rhythm more it's that sort of high notes and the more you do it\nThe more you come up with different metaphors and comparisons and ways of describing flavors and textures and the more you start to appreciate\nWhat it is you're tasting because now you've really spent the time and effort to really take notice of it so you know I'm not a restaurant critic but I play one on TV and I can tell you that you too can eat like a restaurant critic you just have to

survey says the board flips acid lights up and you take home fabulous prizes and that's because chefs are always talking about how the splash acidic vinegar is what elevates a dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career around chefs versus the cooks himself and then it's a photographer and writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegar as\nYou put the food in the class that you put it in there and it'll be medium rare for you know until you feel like eating it\nExactly and then all you need to do is a quick fear almost all ... and give it that crust the brown crust that you love and and it's done it's perfect\nAlso ... gives you time back because you're putting food in the bath and then you can walk away what I like to do when I'm circulating food for dinner is make a side salad and make a thought [laughter]\nJulie romantic to say hey I'm going to circulate better not [laughter]\nAren't test cooks call it swimming so they're going to go swim something right now which I think is like I like\nThat [laughter] to feed it gives you time back which is really nice for dinner parties or just week night dinners\nI think that she gets a bad rap for being too techie or to sciency or something that you really have to understand Celsius in Fahrenheit and time and temperature grabs et cetera but it's not it's it's incredibly simple you can put food in a Ziploc bag\nStick it in a water bath heated to the ... temperature and then you can walk away and that is really wonderful especially 'cause there's no danger of over cooking your food\nRight what's the effect of time but you said if you have a piece of say beef for the hundred twenty five degrees are always going to be medium rare doesn't matter if it stays there for\nTwenty minutes or if it stays there for twenty four hours for instance I saw chef once advertise on their menu these short ribs were breeze she read for Seventy two hours does that make a difference but if you did it for forty eight hours or fifty three hours like what is if it's presumably felt the same temperature\nThat's an excellent question and I think one of the most interesting things about ... is that it's about temperature of course but it's also about time and you can play with those two things together in ways that you can't do with traditional cooking\nYou can do some very interesting things with meat held at lower temperatures for a longer period of time for example we've been working with Chuck roasts which is a relatively cheap piece of meat it has a lot of college in and has a lot of fat traditionally you would cook it at a higher temperature for a number of hours\nTo break down that college in and get it to be really tender\nBut force feed we've been timing this talk into\nA roast like shape something that looks a little bit more compact and beautiful and then we're sort of eating at at a hundred and thirty three degrees Fahrenheit for twenty four hours straight so it's a long time in a relatively low temperature bath and when this thing has done\nIt is like a prime rib ah all that time in the bath keeps it bright pink it's incredibly tender and juicy it tastes be fewer than anything I've ever tasted\nAnd it's cooked perfectly evenly from end to end and then there's also something to enzymes that are active at this lower temperature there's more of an active when you're keeping something at this low temperature it's the same that happens when your dry aging steak\nUmm so when you're doing this low temperature cooking you really are tend to rising meat and having it become more flavorful\nI have to ask you a question though [laughter]\nI was I was talking to people like oh I knew he was interviewed and a friend of mine said you need to ask this question and that is what's the deal with cooking as you said a few little plastic bags that is that okay that safe as they were like ... stuff that's going to leach into our food like honestly for me I kind of feel like\nIf that is what does million so because but [laughter] not everyone but so is there anything to be afraid of with cooking in plastic like a\nWay that the question we get all the time and I and I get it there's a lot of stuff out there about how plastic and painting BPA which is an industrial chemical is harmful if it's heated that it can leach into the food\nThe good news is that all plastic bags that are created for ... or ... or ... or backing ceiling are incredibly safe\nAnd even better all of the good quality plastic bags like by zip lock the a freezer save up lock bags are also say they're not made with BPA they're made from polyethylene and polypropylene\nWhich have been shown to be very safe when it comes to cooking and heat and also ... isn't necessarily cooking in plastic you can cook in Mason jars which are glass when you're cooking eggs they can cook right in their show\nThat's maybe it's okay to suicide from perfectly cooked meat and fish what other things can you play with him seafood\nSo when I started working in the lead in America says get an I really thought it was about meat and about eggs and that was kind of it but as we've been working on this book from the the science team we've been diving into recipes that surprised me\nFor example homemade yogurt or you just bring milk up to an almost boil to kill bacteria\nOut a little bit of starter which can be yogurt that you already have put it into Mason jars and then circulated at a hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit for anywhere between five and twelve hours depending on how pain like your yogurt in the end of uh that's it and it's so foolproof because you don't have to worry about having it in a low a van or\nAnything like that or having to monitor a pot on the stove you just put it in and then\nAnywhere between five and two hours later you're done and it's delicious and then we've also been making ... ... a desserts seaweed is actually a thing we haven't gotten to the desert chapter yet but we have plans to make crumbled lay putting dealt all ha very excited to start testing that oh awesome\nAnd there are a lot of the circular leaders now out on the market and you guys have done a test of the best ones right\nThat's right our tasting and testing team has dove into all of a circulated that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook\nAnd they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circulate are and it's small and it's sleek and ed is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful and about how much of the jewel so the jewels around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm see the devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower now they're very light to very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks two hundred and way way cheaper now too so I guess if I'm Sorry ... they're like so much for that\n[laughter] and thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test
