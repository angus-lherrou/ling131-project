the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWhat a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped about I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual alleged that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nI see okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yes ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV uh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six and a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stores\nThe quality of childcare in Texas maybe keeping some parents and eventually their kids out of the workforce say ever it is with the advocacy group children at risk she says the research they've done points to early childhood programs as being even more important than dropout prevention initiatives in high school\nBy then you are putting a band aid on an open wound right like you are trying to ... something that means sketches with a band aid really could prevent that whole problem from

Shapiro\nAnd I melted Chang Saturday shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to a lotta Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome\nThank you it's great to be here I'm going to start with a very basic question but it's a question that still confound me why are Jews such a focus for white nationalist [noise] you\nKnow for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of white Mrs superior and\nReal intention to maintain that kind of superiority ... on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how those transpired between people\nBut also an institutional and national levels through our politics on through the way that we talk about documentary history authored a way that we manager institutions and it's an effort to maintain power and to keep people who are different um marginalized I'm separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white ... much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh eighty\nTo Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background\nTo white nationalist or you know are Jewish community here in the United states largely comes from immigrant backgrounds already come from backgrounds that had a strong ethnic identity when we came to this country\nAnd all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and as we're both elevated and celebrated in this country as far as our history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of gee that's different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threat\n[noise] people of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate from those who have more\nSkinned privilege because her skin presents later or wider and then in contrast we think about the hatred of Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country then we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identity\nSued you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there's something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's the new\nI think when we have our policymakers amplifying ideas as real amplifying stereotypes as fact\nAnd using fear to marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different\nAnd the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified\nSo what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employ to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember is that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us\nAnd so this is the most important strategy we can develop is to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships so that it\nAnd we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on doors or when they are marking down our streets that we know each one of us is going to come out of our houses to support the other that we will not question who needs who need just kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and all\nThat is our most important\n... is director of the use of color field building initiative thank

get and keep black women energize\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights as a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a

Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro and just the past week we've seen three high profile cases of domestic extremism too are deadly shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third was the explosives sent through the mail a prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here in the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Hi Greg hey are we hear so much about international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacists\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than in indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other or men born in the u._s. should we read something into that is this the new face of extremism\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago uh the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media the Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they steady terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk\nWhat are the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to violence and we find that the believing in this collective sense of ... is a necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism probably\nNot the same level or Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism and he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a few thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here\nI'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail\nBut there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell a who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ... but first\nThe FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it on the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut the way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nBut so if you're a national security correspondent Greg Myre Thanks Greg thanks sorry\nBefore Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gun down eleven people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on gab a social network that prides itself on being censorship free\nGab has since gone dark but the company says it's working around the clock to get back on line\nTo talk more about how gab has created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation at data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring ... for a while now before it was taken down how do people in dad react to the synagogue shooting [noise]\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and and each of these\nInstances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed ... about ... hours posts when he said specifically the words I'm going in\nWould you expect that to do with those like you want to censor or anybody that phrase arm going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach or we wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that she would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with troll cereal harasser as people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGathers down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies at stores they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend how likely is that\nWell I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nWhen you swipe left it's not so many are interested in and if you swipe right than you are interested in if they're interested as well then you connect [noise]\nThese or

inventions they aren't supposed to cover abstract ideas Daniel ... is a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier foundation\nSays you don't get a patent for saying sure to ensure with a drug you have to say what the drug use\nThen along came the Internet and people discovered they can patent some pretty abstract ideas as long as they added a computer like you couldn't pat and the idea of meal planning but you could a patent meal planning on line you can't patent restaurant menus that you could patent on line menus\nThe stomach started really handing out patterns for solve this problem with software\nThat changed four years ago a company called the Alice corporation had some abstract online banking patents and the Supreme Court threw them out the court ruled that an abstract idea plus the computer is still an abstract idea\nNeither says the Alice decision could be bad news for tender if tenders patent is just the abstract idea of matchmaking but online that's no longer allowed but did I mention that it's complicated\nWhat is abstract is itself pretty obstruct and challenging question\nYou can patent software your idea just has to be an innovation so of course tinder says that swiping to match people was unique in innovative\nThe slight fight is still working its way through the courts\nBut in the meantime it's clear the Supreme Court's decision tightened the rules for software patterns which has had a big impact way beyond the dating industry Naser argues it's been a positive change promoting healthy competition but others worry that good patents are being thrown out as well Michael Risch is a professor at Villanova University law school\nIf you apply the definitions courts usually ... many of our most famous um would wind up being on ... like the
