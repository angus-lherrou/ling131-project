forty eight largely along party lines in favor of Kavanaugh\nThe vote ended weeks of sharp partisan battles over the fifty three year old Kevin ... who'd been accused by several women are sexually assaulting them charges he angrily denied in the debate before the vote senator sounded like they were describing two different men Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called him a dedicated public servant\nJudge Brett God at all is among the very best our nation has to offer\nYou will ... on the contrary proud\nSo that minority leader Chuck Schumer on the other hand said Kavanaugh's confirmation was a low moment for the Senate and the country to set it\nIs about to elevate a nominee\nWho doesn't belong\nOn the nation's highest bench\nThe White House's Kavanaugh will be sworn in

region where the Taliban continues to wage attacks around fourteen thousand American troops remain in the country as part of NATO's mission to train Afghanistan's own security forces\nYou know like all of us are and and as you know other human beings are many of the women are reacting very differently to this they are bringing forward experiences that they have had where they have been assaulted I'm physically in some cases threatened with assault\nAnd their reactions to it are also very important then when the reasons we ... that we're interested in as I said earlier kind of the fallout from this and the kinds of decisions that have been laid bare in this do you think that people's personal reactions are guiding that response to this or do you think it's something else even among your colleagues\nI'm quite sure that personal reactions are guiding lots of people on this just because that is human nature I Can't speak any particular person uh but uh uh it it's an surprising that this would be so and I don't think it should be condemned but again if you're asking\nSomebody to maintain complete composure [noise]\nUm [noise] I think you're expecting something that is too much to expect of of normal people occasionally again you could have someone who does keep his cool under such extraordinary circumstances but I think that's the exception rather than the rule and I think if you're asking about judicial temperament\nA much better guide for judicial temperament is how a judge Kavanaugh behaved in about ten years more than ten years on the DC circuit bench should everybody seems to say that his temper but his butt excellent\nThere okay it's a it's a professor you know the defendants are accused of terrible things all the time but they may or may not have done and they are not allowed to behave this way I mean a criminal defendant who presented himself in court or herself\nWho was accused of something terrible that he or she did not do would not be allowed to scream at people would not be allowed to be patronize singing condescending toward the judge or toward other parties\nOr if I were a member of a jury and somebody was on the stand accused of effects could be anything else I and I saw him are reacting in anger when questioned by the prosecutor and interrupting say the prosecutor\nI I'd like to think I wouldn't hold that against him of course I'd look at the evidence I'd want to know if he's guilty\nUh but uh uh I Would say if you behave anger lead that anger is not inconsistent with innocence and it's not a fine of bad character is a sign of someone who is reacting to very very serious accusation\n... let me go back to the question of the legal community um do you agree that this is a an episode on on what else to call it I don't mean to minimize it by calling at that moment that has risen\nYou were a profession one of the things she noted in your blog post is that a lot of people disagree with you people respect they disagree you disagree with other people whom you respect and that you've had a lively dialogue about it has this been a notable moment for your profession and why do you think that is\nWell a yes of course it's notable this is something that's very high profile about a very unfortunate matter a people sharply disagree on this of course the legal academy is overwhelmingly liberal\nAnd uh and as you pointed out a war one is coming from it colors once perception and are just as conservatives are predisposed to respond one way to such things liberals and other way so it's an surprising that there would be a lot of uh she's coming from kind of a hard one political reactions\nBut also or just even people who are not particularly partisan I feel very strongly about this because it's in the news or a and because it is about somebody who can bird but even if I can for under will be a very important to a bigger in legal life for for decades to come\nThat is Eugene Volokh he is the Gary ... professor of law at the

now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nA have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... what does professor Ford want to happen now I'm listening she told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation as FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford\nButtons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to be an important\nThat they don't like about like ... ... far western area in China as well as Tibet and Taiwan\nAnd so there are certainly a feeling that some scholars do self censor in order to get visas others are very brave and and are willing to not be able to get visas to go in\nTo one more question for us as you know it's very focused on Russian influence in elections and a Russian efforts to interfere with us elections when it comes to undermining confidence in democracy particularly let's say in the United states which country is the bigger concern Russia or China\nOr I think Russia has been very overt about it I think China what's concerning about China is that it's much more of a challenge it also would like to undermine\nThe message of the United states which is freedom and democracy the difference being that Russia does not have a business plan it's a relatively small compared to China in terms of economy China's an enormous economy getting very close to surpassing ours in the future\nAnd they're also a much more sophisticated and will run country and so I think it's a much much greater challenge but these days because of what happened in Tucson than sixteen election this is what we focus on which is Russia\nThat NPR's London
