about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself who wants to do a great deal of climate change\nHave been guilty of propagating is telling the public that you know you can have the greatest transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy to one that's based on renewables et cetera within the space of the few decades and you know well it isn't going to cost you anything can practice going to be economic growth in Homs\nNow I don't think any practical votes or believes that and all the evidence is this a hadn't clock correctly

an extremely optimistic the pessimism is about these top down kind of global agreements the optimism comes from the transformation that technology is if you want to think for around the ... century

S.\nAnd from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published\nToday in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa that\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of glitter right Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's planes and one of those ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot out healthcare to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities it also taps into our pocketbooks in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters especially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their turn their campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare fully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue\nThat is going to define the results in the November sixth election\nIs health care and President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular is this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag\nThirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money as it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than that we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their hotter seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto mental like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and bright when you actually have to debate the the details of the plan\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa it's probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR is fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence and now here comes Michael Storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today

Carolinas than drenched some places still reeling from Hurricane Florence\nPlaces such as New Bern North Carolina we interviewed Dana outlaw he's the mayor of New Bern on September fourteenth so not even a month ago as floodwaters from Florence swamped city\nWe have had twelve hundred nine one one request on the last twelve hours that's very unusual\nAnd we have called mayor outlaw back to ask about how the cleanup effort is gone and how they're bracing for this next hurricane mirror outlaw ... good to have you with us\nThank you um we have a lot to break down we picked up about thirty five percent what we're trying to do right now is just stabilize the debris that we have not take that so that in the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this uh the breeding material will stay put not scatter\nWell let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks ago a with Florence you hum had\nAsked people to evacuate you actually were telling us about firefighters out on fire trucks telling people to leave get somewhere safe how about this time are you looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld than by we have an emergency operations there that we have not activated we have forty one truck\nPicking up debris as quickly as we can we have nine cities and towns across the state that are helping us for that effort we just ah yeah we're our prayer for our friends down in Florida Georgia South Carolina what that this thing will not be anything like the impact that we had horses ours was a storm surge and\nThis appears to be more of a of a highway and\nThere is any love weekend by the time it hits it hits you we hope when\nYou say you've got people are picking up debris you're talking about to brief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that's just come down newly since then with wind\n[laughter] well what kind of like in phases we uh the initial debris from the shock of of what happened and and now folks are are getting in getting the as life without murder to their home yeah they're finding out that their heat pumps and ate the existence of a compromise that does work\nAnd so uh you know sheet rock and and all the components of the home or you know we just uh after careful inspection by our respective department many as ... as we found that there's a lot more detailed or what has

much\n[noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also to what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous and in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their fears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool Tibet as\nHave emerging markets and the IMF\nGave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long time or trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so Trump said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nYou know when you get on an airplane you get safely to the next location because airline industry has a checklist\nWhen elite started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually he started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take someone off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberation not what you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patience to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the ... a B C D E F bundle\nThat bundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause delirious\nPatients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious and that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting\nAs he sits on a ... bed ... explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again that they view\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered dementia by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey have been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into we're talking about a a cultural\nChange so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by and then you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and the only two rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistant to using the eighth through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F\nIs the exception it was even a challenge to make it routine at Vanderbilt\nLike an ... an team\nJoanna starlings or clinical pharmacist as he ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through they need to many cat\nWe need to be here and racing in San ... champion this project really empower the American dream makes you happy\nWith him at least crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back to the ice you always see some financial benefits
