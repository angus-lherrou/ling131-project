professor Fukuyama view is I think it's a symmetrical do not think this is a matter of both sides I Believe that there there was a tremendous breaking the Democratic process in the way that Kavanaugh's nomination\nWas handled and so once we're able to redress those skills as we always are I think we'll get back to the to the more normal turbulence of democracy set of instead of its current extreme version\nI invested or what should we do about this then\nWell I think on the on the U.S to take the example of the the Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration that the same could be set up\nWe need to acknowledge what the baseline in this was not a normal process I worked when I was in the White House on two Supreme Court nomination\nWe turned over every page of\nJustice Elena Kagan's White House documents\nThis White House withheld hundreds of thousands of pages you had an FBI investigation I wrote about what a normal one would have

across the country but I actually think that that by itself is not going to turn the trick because this is something I think that really need leadership I agree with the ambassador that the\nThe blame has not been symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests has done everything that you can uh to try to increase the degree of polarization but in a certain sense that means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is a result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard is really bad leadership it means that somebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of ...\nSo if they're for press really have a minute left So Professor ... leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and\nI think that if you're you know I really do think the upcoming election in November is one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election goes

considered from NPR News\nSince the show's Nineteen sixty three debut the British science fiction series doctor who has always had a male actor in the lead role until now NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans says the first doctor who episode featuring Jodie Whittaker which airs today on BBC America breaks ground and a surprising way\nWhat may be most revolutionary about the new doctor who was how on revolutionary this first episode feels\nYes it is wonderful to finally have the shows he wrote an alien who regenerate and to a different form instead of dying finally played by a woman after fifty five years and when that woman is excellent British actress Jodie Whittaker you get a scene that explains that transformation like this\nMoment when you show you're about to die\nAnd then keep on site now\nHas changed my fish has his law laws and it was called who wants who I Am fine in the end\nOf course this is Dr Hu it always turns out All right in the end mostly\nWhittaker plays the doctor a centuries old time traveling town and lord who writes wrongs across the universe her first episode of the fast pace but kind of generic adventure that could have featured any doctor who's passed male stars\nIt's got a simple plot an alien as top down in England with the various plans the doctor must stop him walk coping with her own recent changes\nWhat occurs predecessor Scottish actor Peter Paul the initially play the doctor has an alien who could be callous because evolution into a caring Dr someone who would sacrifice themselves for lesser beings\nRather than be annoyed by them was a central arc of compiled is three seasons on the show he was a speech from his last regular season episode\nDuring this because I Want to show more so because it was hardly ever does I Know what I Love all its kind\nWhat occurs doctor has no such issues and a showdown she tells the bad guy exactly where she stands\nYou trying to get outraged cannot blame the guy that\nI Know exactly who I Am\nThey don't see how that plays out the UNIVAC\nWhy you charge\nStill Whittaker is the first episode doesn't tell us much about her character like previous doctor she's brilliant eccentric and surprisingly attached to a human life in Britain Sheikh censor gender change with barely a hiccup when a police officer points out the obvious\nI think they just do a lot of hiking the amount that\nGives you a woman does it humane well\nSorry half an hour that was why ...\nDoctor who often features doctors who speak to the times when James Bond was popular in the early seventies bashing John Hurt we played the doctor and twenty ten twenty something Matt Smith was a millennial aged doctor now a female Dr emerges when the subject of women's empowerment is front page news but in the first episode\nWould agree shatter stereotypes mostly by acting like her male predecessors\nShe was a mostly unquestioned authority there's no annoying romantic subjects she doesn't exist mostly to be safe from danger or inspire revenge or be someone's conscience all troops for female characters round throughout science fiction and in past doctor who episodes\nFans know the first episode featuring a new doctors often awkward the writers and actor haven't fully clicked with the character which may explain why new show runner Chris chip now is the first episode Whittaker doesn't feel particularly exceptional beyond introducing a great supporting cast but there's also some powerful about just getting on with it\nAnd letting the new doctor be your own woman in\nThis is NPR News the president's evangelical

officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers Terence carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs\nWe wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria have felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it is not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to something off ... versus ... officers\nSo from my perspective it's fairly well Dr phil fan there why this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turn that we as saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nWell you know ... in every age we know what works people going to make a difference we know that non violent civil disobedience words we noted protests works\nWe know that voting works but in every age there's different or you have to face it the way in Eighteen hundred for instance they were just trying to get the right to vote now\nAnd then the Nineteen sixties today we're trying to hold on to what we want before and then press on to what we need to see done you know we tried to hold on to basic voting rights but we also want to get to where\nEverybody Eighteen is automatically registered they were voting as a holiday where same day registration or the voting is something that happens in every state\nUh you know years ago people were fighting just to talk about is getting out today we've tried to hold onto their father to a form of carrot added expanded the universal healthcare so it takes it requires a certain understanding of the times\nThey how do you but I Am thinking about things like how do you get people to see these issues in a fresh way which is kind of the essence of creativity I mean some of your techniques like preaching\nA speaking writing demonstrating though is are classics but you've also done things that are kind of ... like you know give me an example of kind of like a fresh way to get people to look at something that they think that they already understand\nWhat you know you read mix I mean James Brown was classic soul but the rappers ... so you ... so what you do is for instance back in in the day\nThey have freedom schools and teach them what what we did with moral Monday is and what we do around the country we do something to call but imposed a mall political organizing leadership Institute and ... and what we do is we bring people together of all races treats colors\nAnd classes and we say OK let's look at voter suppression of for instance the real numbers the Iraq War data twenty six states who said no less those same states a hot topic these days those same state\nPassed laws against immigrant people and gay people those same steaks up to that a ... a Medicaid expansion those same states did not union rights so if if if the same states that passed racialized voter suppression\nAnd the people that get elected because of racialized voter suppression then used the election to hurt mostly white people\nAnd most of the poor people and we show people that empirically\nThen they began to say oh wait a minute we're fighting the same people the same people that are attacking the immigrants that uh one of the attack and he'll get the same people that I can help you\nOut of one attack and voting rights and so if they are cynical that's got to be together we have to be smart enough to come together that is the way in which you read mix if you will what was done in the past and you expanded into press\nSo before we wrap up here and you mentioned at the outset that this is not a lifetime achievement award this is an investment in you\nTo watch whatever it is you want to do next as you know when a MacArthur genius grant winters previously with Lin Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton so you know no pressure um what what what are you going to do

people would do you know one thing about her long list of things in her book you know you see painted a picture I think of what she remembered what she saw as a child\nI remember I remember when I was researching a little bit about her life ... it was so amazing to me that you know she wrote this incredible classic that's almost\nLike a Journal of life and what living was like in this community are free to write and it's like you said it's such detail and then you realize she moved away when she was Fifteen sixteen years old ... ... to like you said all that suffered so implanted yeah remember yes\nBut I think that ... that there was always you know very politically astute she was always you know she was involved in all kinds of movements definitely the civil rights movement and I think again that drove her but you know I think she had the the artistic side with her cooking\nAnd that job and I don't know that she really you know necessarily was thinking I'm going to write this cookbook about our lifestyle and I'm going to make a statement I think that that was just always in her\nThe cooking was such an important part of her life but you know the politics and whatnot was too and I think\nThat I guess she ended up making a statement because she was you know talking about the lives of these people that had been through so much and really struggle to make a decent normal life for themselves\nBut that it was not just scratched and Claude her way to survival\nIt oh yeah no no no they made they made they made a beautiful I'm sure it was tough and probably because she was so young\nYou know even if you listen to a greater pets you know as as a young person they'd they'd probably\nBird as much of that if they could she probably thought she would have seen the end result of people coming out of slavery and surviving and building this little town and and just it's just a testament to people putting things behind them and just going forward and looking forward\nAnd I just I just think that's I think it's all made thing and I think there's there's lessons that they must be thousands of free towns and I think they have a lesson for us today and you know they will into the future how people can come through you know God Knows what still um make a make a life and survive and reach out and touch people\nOr do you so much you know it's always a pleasure talking

voices and showing a sliver of what she meant to\nServe Franklin as a writer and educator was the person behind them and\nSo I think so much for coming in today it's a pleasure Frances\nSo I Am really interested in how you got interested in the work I've been to Louis I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally and we never met her I was right\nBut are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eight when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by in the Senate Louis called what a southern and in this essay I\nMiss Lewis position to the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... of kitchens and also alongside music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly striking moment as someone who was interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food\nWas a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and just try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and sell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with an illness as editor Judith Jones who in the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on cut in Rhode Island and yes that Iron Man Frank ... but I'm leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is their English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about for work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that starts to attention and pay attention moment in into the Joneses career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity yeah what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans house and you're the perspective of home cook\nAnd then it just I think for many people who come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility ... and sort of ... when she only direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to a gym down your throat and and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it in that when you were you say that came late\n[noise] well you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another\nBut if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day ... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture\nUm and that we just cook just for ourselves and so we did for that entire week you know we would go and pick her up she was staying with friends of mine and\nWe know she would I was ready to get right into the kitchen and she would always\nSay have you had your coffee [laughter] that would be the guess I've had plenty of coffee but she would want to go sit and have coffee and we would go to a cafe or somewhere I have coffee for very long time and sometimes three hours\nAnd then we would make her way to the kitchen and we would cook and we would cook late into the evening and the first thing I ever I did ask her up because the very first thing that ever had that she made a dead original dinner that I tried to get into the kitchen to help with the unsuccessfully [noise]\nAh I was lucky enough to attend and she had made turtle soup\nTurtle soup I mean I was frankly little squeamish um it it seemed kind of grainy clamped it to me a little bit [laughter] uh but uh and I really had no idea what to imagine but I was also very excited I mean it was certainly was exotic [noise]\nUm but I was not at all prepared you know for what was delivered to the table and it was this clear clear\nAmber consummate that had this cloud floating on the top and the fragrance was unlike anything it was so complex and yet so simple so nuanced and\nAnd this clouds little dumpling dealt with flooding on the top and that was the latest thing you ever encountered and uh that had bits of turtle meat and tiny leaves a fresh time I'm folded into it\nAnd uh it remains you know one of the most and mysterious things that I ever and delicious and memorable and and meaningful now um things I ever tasted and um\n[noise] that experience was so interesting because I I'd assumed because it was so complex and nuanced in ... areas and the theory all and\nI'm adjectives fail me but it it I just assume there must be a multitude of ingredients in secret steps and you know spells a and instead I mean I went ahead and and I'd gotten the turtle meat and I was like when you know what else do we need and it was you know\nThat was about it [laughter] I mean if you needed some Sherry internal and some onion and um we put in a pot it's with a vast amount of water I solved and put it on very low heat and it quote and quote and quote unquote\nAnd I can remember tasting it after about three hours or so and being I didn't say this of course but I I was\nDisappointed I mean I thought it tasted like water [laughter]\nI I thought this is not it will be she's not going to pay me this recipe she's not going to teach me how to do this [laughter] um and so I you know it's like what do you think [laughter] she said it would just you know let's let it cook longer and so we did I mean it could for hours I'm and she would out a little salt and\nPut the lid back on after we tasted and this went on for a while and I could begin to taste a little something after a few hours\nWhen I was still ... suspicious [laughter] uh and then all of a sudden you know it became and and did was he was exactly what I tasted that night and uh [noise] it was extraordinary and that was quite a lesson you know that was quite a lesson\nUm and then we made the dumplings and\nAnd then there really became a that that that turtle soup remains very um [noise]\nIt's symbolic is emblematic from me and and very meaningful swift every time there was a special occasion or for her birthday or or someone special was coming to visit I Would always you know if they really special than they would warrant turtle soup\nYeah and that's soup the way you describe it it's such a cooking of patience and the cooking of observation and that's so much of what I think about what I think of this law is not ever having in their food only having read her writing\nSo much in the case of country cooking is about observation patience with the world patients with the seasons yeah patience and wonder um\nOur sense of wonder about things you know we weren't really always stands out to me there was um [noise] there was a real sophistication there of someone who is brilliant and sensitive and artistic and observant and had great um\nSavvy and ... you know in a degree of sophistication and at the same time there was always about her I girlish innocence\nThat was so attractive and so powerful really that she could see the moon and it was like [noise] she gave like she'd never seen the moon before [laughter] and I I\nI feel so old and jaded and have all my entire life [laughter] but I I I Try to to be like that I Want to be like that and I guess in some ways I Am like that I mean in in the last week for life I mean when the last things I can remember was was giving her um pound cake and our kitchen table\nAnd you know she Gaston said beautiful\nAnd um\n[noise] what a gift yes thank you so much Scott thank you ... ...\nIt's got to be talking a chef and teacher and the author with another myth of
