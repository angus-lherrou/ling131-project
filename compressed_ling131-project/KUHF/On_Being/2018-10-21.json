[noise] yes\nAnd and I I think a lot about it and to me this comes through in you talking about um the deep story cars and that and as you said the fact that faction moral pre sects a rise out of the deep store and\nWe don't actually have these take some milk shake that mattered Asian or move them from it right on about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a felt true yeah and I mean when I went\nBack and forth between Berkeley and\nAnd the people I came to know and really respect and the other world of the south um southwest Louisiana I came to\nTo realize that there were different truths and different truths and so there are fat so I Believe in the reality is yeah it's the deep story and again we all have\nThe story um it ... Powell certain facts that don't fit and insights other facts to do [noise]\n\n\nI'm ... and this is on being to date with the esteemed sociologist of emotion or early ... [noise]\n\n\nYou and strangers and they're on land um take up what\nYou call it the whole issue\nUm to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject\nAnd to to really understand the dynamics anytime it the great paradox and um [noise] you know you point at this dynamic that in the part of the country or in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... rate pollution\nAnd great really resist gesture regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that\nWould say um it's just obvious and\nBut you know there's a there's a background I think Frank I'm partly I think the people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out it's the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of debts and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... the state\nYeah which seems to come down on the little guy he no I should just take this by you if you're motorboat leaks little gas into the water the word and no right you up but if companies leaks thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life here the state let's go\nHow dire known that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have\nOutsourced the moral majority work to the state\nSo they say oh pay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with art developing let's talk jobs jobs jobs and so the company is with the money that the state gets them ... ...\nEmbraced as similar what was missing from those two responses once the idea that you can be exactly who you are yeah and take your alarm system off\nClimbing into the wall and we get to know people on the other side of it and I don't and then I got ... oh you must be especially empathic no not at all\nIn fact she you know I think we're all actually extremely good at it the only thing is we don't apply that skill that knowledge to\nGetting to know the author and wherever we defined as uh-huh uh-huh that's the only thing different I did\nYeah I noticed that I Know I 'cause I I look at and more at a number of interviews that were done interviews you gave\nAnd have given across your sign out is ... number of uh especially in shape and progressive um interviewers they liked the remark with great astonishment on your kindness kind how could you be so kind\nAnd it in a way it kind of models kind of direct more an right they that right [laughter]\nToo kind to fool ... Jewish\nSomebody said asked so after Charlottesville now that we've seen that\nYet how can you talk to these people and\nYeah and and to me another great paradox engaging different which is you describe right as you said it's not about going in and saying change my mind\nI Want to be Republican right I Want to join the military or for or expecting them to because they engage with you say you know I I Want to I Want to be at Berkeley why didn't [laughter] I'm see I didn't change your politics than what you said and and I think this is true and I know you've seen as a sociologist across all kinds of like meaningful and counter with different\nYou said in in large me as a human being yeah\nRight right it did it did and uh to be able to imagine myself into a a different heart [laughter] one man told me you know look we have\nSimilar minds and we have similar hearts but we have different soles I thought that was so interesting and so I said to him sank you for saying that um would you be a\nCoal sociologist with me and a half and figure out how the soles are different and he looked at me\nScratch just said well I'm not sure what I Do what you mean your [laughter] oh\nYeah you know this but the thing um another wonderful encounter\nA was with a gospel singer\nWho was shot sitting across the table at a meeting of Republican women of southwest Louisiana and she said oh I Love Rush Limbaugh [laughter] well I first thought oh my goodness [laughter] ah and then I thought\nWander full I his chance for me to get larger here [noise] so I sent her could we meet a sometime this week for some sweet peas and and you can explain what you\nWhat you love Rush Limbaugh and she said yeah sure so next day we're meeting for sweet tea is and she explains I ... love\nRush Limbaugh because she hates seminar sees I thought oh my goodness oh\n... so I ask what what is a feminine ... to feminist too you know done like children doesn't want men coat and uh she goes on to our mental wacko ... you know it's people that aren't regulated us to death\nAnd after I'm asking her she stopped me in sense um\nYou've told me that you uh\nCome from you know the other side [laughter]\nOr is it hard for you to listen to me and I told her actually it's not hard at all I have my alarm system off and you were I'm learning about you and you were doing is such a big favor\nTo share your thoughts on I Can't tell you a grateful I Am and then she says take your alarm system off I Do that too she says I don't do it with my kid side too hot parishioners and I thought you know okay we'll start with\nPat yeah little common ground for\nMe in fact do that all the time because I didn't see what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it's habit we have in in the other player I Believe it at work right because you can't just\nBlurted out well how you really feel about what someone fed at every moment of a no no there are rules about that there should be some kind of a ground rules social loudest [noise] yeah yeah yeah one thing I can get really\nBetter at it than\nThan we are so that's a great invitation yes doesn't mean that you're ... see that's the misunderstanding yeah think yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over by a hunting not at all no mhm no I don't know ...\nIt just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed a way\nOf talking um\nYeah actually that is\nThe fundamental floor of social interaction you\nBarrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh identities pushing it into yeah shifts counterproductive\nIt is counterproductive and sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points right that might be made I I Want to say you know do you want to be right and every moment you know or did you want to be part of the larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and Law Order to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know make it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAnd bad [noise] Mm Mm Mm [noise] oh cool [noise]\nI'm\nChristian Tibetan dishes on being today with the steamed and sociologist of emotion hardly hawk shield [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm not a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land and this time you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right I mean one of the things you found\nWhich I think it's an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considers it was on to be an lightened is um [noise] uh that regulation\nThat a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ...\nHerring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made a lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense and that government\nMhm mhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done phew that's you know maybe they will point\nMay be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed some things that didn't do okay let's figure that out let's have a right back for public conversation about just that [noise] it is for the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or are they expecting too much of it\nWhat's the record into a let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah [noise]\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent in extreme or ... I think maybe this was at another interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met or five years of research you found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing\nPrison populations for non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure\n[noise] um so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] well we're hanging fruit right\nMhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\n[noise] you I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
