reacted so far\nPresident Trump has been talking about it in sending pretty mixed signals here says he wants to get to the bottom of this but he's also saying he doesn't want to jeopardize these big contracts which are mostly arms deals between the U.S and the Saudis the Saudis are are huge buyers of American weapons\nSaudi Arabia ... left as consul into this don't belong to harm but has not

state of cutter as NPR's Steve Henn reports\nCasually guest hosting Rush Limbaugh's syndicated radio show and Internet and sixteen you were a conservative who has not supporting the Republican nominee but your year was a lot more than that\nSo I as all bad stories begin I went to a CrossFit box [noise]\nTwenty Fifteen I'm traveling the country in the debates needing to get back in shape was out of breath all the time and it just got worse than that you know my dad told me everything went downhill at forty and I hit forty and thought did you everything is falling apart she couldn't do CrossFit couldn't keep up um it got worse\nThought it was allergies of next thing I Know uh I and being rushed into in ICU after getting a seat you literally I got to see the skin and you know the tax aren't supposed to tell you anything and the guy comes in those twice as do I strap him down\nAnd I just she fell out laugh at it started to sit up and he pushes us just no you can't get up you should be dead I had twenty some odd blood clots in my lungs are they had been accumulating and literally my wife couldn't be there she had to pick up the kids so we weren't expecting anything it was allergies\nAnd while I'm In the ... of course you can't get your cell phone working and I get out of range and my phone's just lights up it's my wife of the Mayo Clinic could cold she had these random spots her lungs that had him for years and they called and said she were to come in a shoe they were starting to see people with her condition develop lung cancer\nSo all this happened to my wife has a very rare form of genetic a lung cancer there is no cure a we have all these these things happen and I had written that I wouldn't support the president\nUh we had to have armed guards at the house for three months or and you know I'm I couldn't support him because he didn't reflect my values and I didn't think he reflected the values of the people I show who are aggressively supported him and I just felt like somebody needed to say this is madness\nBut you also then set out to write this book um which it came out at the end of last year and a few thousand Seventeen when I think it's my closet cookbook\nAuthor where they're at their house yet there are rather fascinating [laughter] I'm [laughter]\nYou have to read a little while to get\nTo the cut but um but it's led life lessons from my father to his children because what you also doing that but and I didn't want to say that you also have\nOur on record saying that if somebody pointed nibble at your head and said you have to either vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton you would have to choose the bullet yeah so that's also who you are [noise]\nI Need to be ... Senate or I'm\nI'm a non tax and in\nThat room in this book you also said here you start looking at at I Do think you know that's that's reckoning like what how what have I done any last year that is on record it is on the Internet that my kids are going to read one day and I want them to understand me and a greater fall mess and to me that's an is yeah\nYou know I I make my living on the Internet I'm very blessed I've had a TV and radio studio in my house or for years thanks to the Internet um I initially got started as a writer on the Internet because I hated being a lawyer\nAnd I've increasingly become mindful of two things about the Internet one is that all of us myself included um we we can lose ourselves on the Internet and become our worst cells\nAnd then others want to define us by the worst thing we've done on the Internet or even if it was a decade ago and and probably the worst thing I've ever done ... on the Internet was a decade ago people still bring it up that you have no credibility because of this thing you did ten years ago\nAnd if none of us are allowed to move beyond the worst thing we've done there's no incentive for any of us to become a better person\nAnd I wanted to make sure my kids understood that the other thing and I think this is the most deeply disturbing thing about the Internet no one talks about in should\nIs it is allowed every single person in this room and all of us up here to ignore our physical actual next door neighbor and become friends with the next door neighbor on Facebook\nI told my kids are all the time and I mentioned this little book that Jeremiah twenty nine seven says she the welfare of the city in which you're an exile for their you will find your salvation and I really do believe that means you're low\nCommunity so all politics is local if you don't know about the homeless man under the bridge or that your next door neighbors chicken needs food oh you're not being a good member of the American community and my kids need to understand that they need to know their next door neighbor not just the people on the Internet and\n[noise]\nI'm Chris attempted and this is on being today at the University of Montana with conservative commentator Eric Ericson and progressive commentator Sally ...\nAnd\nAgain I think that this phenomenon of trolls is like a life is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that the ... and then ending is embodied I'm\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well she said you said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know that you\nActually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live on damages and throw rocks at a very deep you speak humanizing latch yes um\nAnd I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy march and these tools didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cooler unkind um and\nAnd in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online\nUm and they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still [noise] um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one wants to be hateful okay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and ready forgotten it's or it\nCould hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling\nAnd they had the opportunity a lot of them apologize ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have\nTo uh you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this ... of technology that then allows us to fuel\nThe human decision that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse\nI happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious if you agree with us Eric is I I've come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and ... [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting and and if we can somehow figure\nOut a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nHabit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many\nPeople in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal for I say oh they're game from supporters me that there are so racist and they're so as long a full but can I hate them [noise]\nBecause they're so hateful I aged out of\nIt and we blame the people for than expressing these use as no not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time mhm so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nMeet someone\nOr ... and you learn about someone in and you learn their interests um you connect with the ... you don't own over the Internet you know I tell people all the time that the reason I'm a conservative is because I Believe we're all sinners and I want a few in charge abuse possible\nAnd then I I also say you know that ... exactly why but I mean that's why like small government or the fewer centers in charge of me I mean I've got enough since I'm On a road about 'em in the book um but a lot of evangelicals and crew in American politics\nHave gotten so wrapped up in their belief in an existential crisis of an assault of their culture and us all to their religion they forgotten the concept of grayish\nAnd I think all of us uh whether or not you are an evangelical Christian whether you're a Christian most ... face cultures ... most spiritual cultures have a concept of grace and I think we lose that over the Internet as we interact more and more with people who are faceless\nAfter a short break more with Eric Ericson and Sally ...\nWe've also just released a new episode only in the on being tied cascade of living the Washington where I moved to the other side of the conversation and shorter form this week with some thoughts on the tender inflammatory heart of our life together right now I find that on apple\nPod cast Google pod cast in spite of fight or wherever you get your favorite shows support for being with Krista tip it comes from the ...

Public media foundation more information at Houston Public media dot org slash donate\nI'm ... and this is on being today with two pundits on opposite ends of the American political spectrum Sally count as a progressive commentator who's also worked for Fox News Erick Erickson as a conservative commentator who's also contributed to CNN\nI spoke with the two of them at the invitation of the University of Montana centered named for Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage humility and respect across the partisan aisle in that you won't have the Nineteen sixties and seventies [noise]\nSince we recorded this conversation Sally and Eric had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who'd come expecting to be bored and instead or riveted\nThey told me they had not witnessed or imagined that a political conversation like this was possible Michael Marcel like Montana Public Radio's program director moderated a few questions from the standing room only audience\nHere's a question in a very particular kind of looking for practical answers to questions are particularly hopeful\nAbout this local ... talked about this person\nIt was if any of you have any practical tips for navigating political mine fields such as the PTA or the co-op for the block party\nThat her life happens that's a great question yeah\nYou you know I I Will say that I I have commented more than once in the last few months that uh I I may give up politics for the pope but at some point and I was old city councilman\nI'm elected and it's worse than national bald local politics as far dirtier um people get mad at you in the grocery store because their their garbage wasn't collected um the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle where this night began or just yeah don't\nShoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives\nUm a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do um but you don't shoot motives to the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background\nAnd we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or what not ... it may not be that they just want to a ... way to get their kid headed over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanting Jews and just getting out of a beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\nMm [noise] um\nOh give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people a sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they pick aside and\nNo one's gonna pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological uh it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day out U.S Mexican for so [laughter]\nBut are there are studies that\nYou know look kids who go to\nRacially integrated elementary schools\nHow grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after school programs are actually reduce\nTheir racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then has a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um [noise]\nAs he wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating I'm like what difference does it make and like the two of you have then and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nSays I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and ... yeah you said some of them not to pay your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men and\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have a what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave\nThe experience myself of\nBeing unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel\nAnd seeing\nThe difference it makes in yourself\nIn for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
