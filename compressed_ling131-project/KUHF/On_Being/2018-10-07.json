this congressional resolution of apology to Native Americans [noise]\nHappened in two thousand nine I had never heard of it until I sat down to prepare to interview you and I don't think you heard about it at the time is that right how did you start how did you come to be trying to cut your attention come to be trained on this\nUh yeah um I hadn't heard\nAbout the apology until months later I think it was ... it was signed in December of two thousand nine and it was some time in the spring I think of two thousand ten I heard about it several months later and\nI was personally really surprised that I hadn't heard about it before part of the reason I hadn't is because it was so quiet yeah and there really was not a lot of risk taking right in how it was um delivered [noise]\nWell I think it was an active as part of the defense appropriations active do that which is a little confusing I'm not necessarily where we would look and you know it's interesting to me because there's a lot of\nFeel like just recently in American culture\nWe started to entertain some new kinds of language like truth and reconciliation is something we might talk about [noise] um [noise]\nWith Native Americans with slavery or reparations 'em or you know words like redemption um and then there is this here's tucked away\nIs this resolution that was passed but never really never spoken allowed right never really offered publicly right I mean I'm just going to read a little bit because probably other people I haven't heard of it either just beginning to acknowledge\nA long history of official deprivation and ill conceived policies by the federal government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all native peoples on behalf of the United states\nIt talks about the fact that native peoples inhabited the present day United States for thousands of years before the arrival of people have European descent that they honor and protecting the steward at this Landry cherish\nAnd then it says whereas whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new chapter\nIn history of if people's and then it continues to whereas whereas whereas and whereas\n[laughter] so you\nDiscovered this and um yeah what was your reaction right I think\nWell first of all what motivated me to even respond to the apology was the delivery so that's the heart of it ... or I should say than non delivery of the apology yeah\nBut then I went online and I read the apology and then I was like oh my gosh the\nThe language it's so careful\nAlso carefully crafted and you know my goodness these\nGuys are poets like [laughter]\nI mean very astute in very aware of what\nEach phrase how how do we sit a you know\nWhat each phrase me Carrie yeah the implication of each phrase and yeah so even\nThe phrasing of um the arrival of Europeans opened a new chapter yeah for native people\nThat's crazy was the opening a new [laughter] that's\nYeah that's almost poetry is very interesting way to to look at what happened right um so and going further into the document\nUm [noise] you know just the idea of for example um they never mentioned genocide great yeah things are phrased as conflicts um lives were taken on both\nSides and now you know the things like\nThat both took innocent lives including women and children [noise] yeah I mean they do say you know the infamous trail of tears on long walk but\nYeah you're right it's very spare and careful right\nYou know I mentioned this to group of students recently I'm\nAt the University of Washington but I'll mention it here as well I was watching this really nice video I'm a little talk by [noise]\nFace spotted eagle she's I'm ... and she was the only native woman to receive a boat from the electoral college\nIn this last um two thousand sled he'll action yeah [laughter] a season amazing um\nBeautiful woman\nA wonderful speaker to [noise] um and so anyway I was watching this video this little talk she was giving and she was talking about\nThe idea of discussing um history discussing some of these traumas that have happened yeah and she was saying for native people\nTalking about these things is important to process of healing uh-huh\nAnd for me I think it's not just feeling I Would add to that sense of justice\nMhm you know being heard\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people cheering and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in your conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial uh-huh it allows a liberation\nSo I think that that's really um maybe what was important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back\nHundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years uh\nI didn't want to jump back to ... or send creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right I'm someone recently asked me\nA little bit embarrassing um they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter]\nIn them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but you know I was a little embarrassed just because I didn't want to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um is\nThat it's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future right is that is a world where are you doing\nI'm Kristen ... and this is on being day with the poet lately long soldier [noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm a you know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do and where as as a it's not just the ... not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is\nAnd and how when apologies are done well I've been in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write I just what you just said I mean you they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brain [noise] oh really yeah\nI didn't but it has to be here but it has since ... contact and so you register that you register that anyway so he wrote and the beginning at the actually the beginning of your response\nWhereas when offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and uncles are in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mine too I feel a sense of\n... [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] it was really important deliberation\nLike this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important\nBut on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that\nUm are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say you know\nA family members sit down next to me and apologize I'm at a national level\nThere's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching\nThat they do right now um and I think that that's something very beautiful and unique ... Standing Rock has offered to the world of\nResistance [noise] um that's not to say that other movements have not had prayer in at the center of what they do either [noise]\nNo but but you're right it's and it's I mean even that word resistance which is very much entered the lexicon right now and not very often I'm hearing about should prayer I'm ... and other contacts I mean the other thing about that is that\nIt's really in reading you saying this about the community taking position and remaining powerful\nI realized it was true and that had come through and what I knew\nBut it's not prioritized in like coverage right it's not the headline [noise] um\nAnd so I think it's important for you to say that like to to speak that for people to hear that too and be looking for that because um [noise] ah I have Standing Rock is going to be with us [noise]\nRight and I think that yeah every movement in every community and they have their own culture their own values that sort of propel\nThe action that they take rights to create and change yeah I don't know if many people are aware aware of how important prayer is to luck hotel life but I always get a kick out of it I had a\nNephew who is on complaining to one of my cousins my sister and he was saying oh\nIt's hard to be called to all we do is pray pray pray all the time [laughter]\nSo it's like\n[laughter] and I yeah I just got a kick out of that so [noise] you know it is is a very real thing yeah and so it is something that um I have really\nAppreciated in love and\nSeeing how that really um influenced every step\nThat the community took I felt\nAnd it's something that I've heard from people who were who went up to Standing Rock it was why I think so many people had a good experience there because there was that prayer in that sense of connection that community um and and\nAll kinds of religious figures all kinds of religious leaders also gathering around with their prayers yeah\nUltimately yeah\nI don't know how you feel about the language of Native American spirituality but if I find a dangerous I worry about it being thrown around and be on I mean is seeing actors and the thing and [noise]\nI mean listen the thing is is there are over five hundred and sixty federally recognized tribes and that's just federally recognized there are many more that are not recognize\nWho are many of them right now or are seeking recognition but the point is is um all of us are different in all of us have\nI'm beliefs and ways that are particular to who we are as a people so you know ... to um beliefs are very different than let's say\nWhere I live here in the southwest from ... some of my friends from Santa Clara Pueblo let's say or Hopi friends or didn't ask friends you mean all of us are\nOur traditions and\nWaves are all so so different you know our stories and and they're also so connected to the land you know we come from there's there's not a separation it's connected yeah so\nAmerican spiritual idea is to an awful term is yeah yeah\nYeah scary it is so broad and yeah yeah abstract yeah and it can be very very superficial and out of context\nRaise I think one of the most striking just sentences that I've read\nOr heard in the context of what's going on Standing Rock as a ... different damage at one of The Elders or maybe that maybe the chief saying you know water is not a resource\nIt is a source of life mhm\nAnd that is just a matter of fact right yeah I mean it's just we never it's not a way we say it or think about it and it's such an ... the whole drama really is such an interesting\nAh [noise] I mean it's so many things that in in you know and and if you look at that sentence it's I'm an amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand\nHow something like quite as water right [laughter] and how a word like resource that gets thrown around and I drove around all the time to like crazy it's like one of the big words now can dehumanize us and be away into into belittling\nYeah a source of life [laughter]\nI yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like I have to oh constantly put out disclaimer Z mhm um before I ever talk on some of these issues because\nYou know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for\nFor all love court to people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert on any of these issues but it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship\nAnd seeing it in that way I mean even just for example one of my friends\nPosted something really funny on a\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people and their um to what was I think red will oh\nThis is the season for getting ready to ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more than you need and leave\nThe plant allow the plant to stay alive for the next ... next year rate so it is always like\nEven just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive is awareness right I'm\nSam ... a sensibility huh of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource right here you are right or something you just take from right and it's something you take from but you do it respectfully right in the same place of course to water and the source of life [noise]\nI Wonder um you mentioned them a little while ago the air that you do talk about your daughter a lot in in your poetry and I know that you know and I like I talk about my my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you had to read and and maybe that's well like for you it is about because I'm not I'm not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but that a single voice of integrity\nAnd searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in factors not um [noise] there's this far in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as mother to teach what it is to be like ... to\n... I I don't want to read that just like the\nOh okay see let me find it OK or maybe I'll read the first two they kind of can yeah OK yeah\nWhereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be low quota there in the question what did I Know about being luckily to\nSignal panic blood rush my embarrassment what did I Know of our language like pieces would I teach her to be pieces\nUntil a friend comforted don't worry you and your daughter will learn together\nToday she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean in St to share a song in dinner her father's language\nTo seems she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch or be in multiple music\nAt a ceremony\nTo honor that didn't nations first poet laureate a speaker explains that each people has been given their own language to reach ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
