or a store\nThat has a membrane roof these are plastic swelled and membranes are available in black or gray or town or a green or whites many cars out there the simplest thing to do would be to choose the white version of the roof\nOn the other hand we know that there'll be many buildings where the roof can be seen from the street and this will mean that the\nBuilding's owner or perhaps the buildings architect will seek a color other than whites\nWe can do that to only about half of sunlight is visible if you want to have a reflective roofs that is not white but will still stay cool in the sun\nYou can focus on reflecting the half of the sunlight that you can't see\nYou can for example get a red roof that reflects only twenty percent of the visible lights giving it it's red color\nBut at the same time reflects about sixty percent of the invisible light the end result is that you reflect about forty percent of all of the sunlight in fact it's\nRoughly doubles the solar reflect ... compared to a traditional red roof\nAnd just in case you're thinking what's the big deal on like the heat and wouldn't it be nice to have warmest summers especially in the u._k. where we

Bush her life is on land on a fascinating story of our time Buddhist meditation made its way to the wedding and his mood and to many realms of human endeavor also reviving contemplative practices\nIn other tradition nearby Bush actually took a corporate ... out of India from Nineteen Seventy two to Nineteen eighty five with her company called elimination it made it to name which\nSilkscreen ... and other iconic spiritual symbols and made it for ten on the rainbow decals that became synonymous with the Vw beetle it's counter cultural American hanging\nIn\nKnow I hear you saying and him and I said you\nYou had a new insight into your mind and into the world and he now does two things belong together but I still like in your thinking and in the work you've done for ringing contemplative practice\nBack out to others you've had a very ...\nFocused way of attending to the intersection between those two things it seems to me that you know the world that has led to share where it unfolded in nice\nForty fifty years [noise] a big dynamic and it is these two strains are down in her life fan out or action kind of find\nAny other city fully [laughter] and you know you you didn't realize that you are going to be part of this you know you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids then kind of really importing would ask them back into\nThe west yeah it's pretty amazing to think back on it on a federal he\nIs I mean when I first came back I mean that's the idea [laughter] we were so marginalized ... to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise]\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly\nAffected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully and and share it with others and so most of them were single and came back and wanted to\nTeach just with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen\nA number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later\nI was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back meditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no should imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter] so but I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives on the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was on the eliminations and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in at a looming nations\nWas integrating this sense not just practice because not everybody worked there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would and body the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and so\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated than subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where\nWhat you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the feces and [noise]\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up [noise] interestingly we did so many things that when I\nMany years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nI'm quite right Shane [noise]\nThat is a chef that is still a still has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture and ideals and and practicalities yeah the story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't that right and when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take [noise] yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineer number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers said who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to\nDoes the restaurants of guacamole fantastic um is brunch served a seven days a week [noise] that's that's great news for the accuracy\nOf for me to interact with the New Yorker next time I'm In New York radio well the New

network in applications to help businesses beyond Comcast Business more Comcast Business dot com and\n\nBecause of that and this is on being to date with nearby Bush she works at an emerging twenty first century intersection of industry social healing and diverse contemplative\nPractices raised Catholic with Joan of arc as her hero she's one of the people who brought put us into the west\nFrom India and the Nineteen seventies she's calling to work with educators and judges social activists and soldiers she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself mirror by Bush's life tells a fascinating narrative\nOf our time the rediscovery of contemplative practices in many forms and for many traditions and the secularists thick of modern culture\nSo let's talk about where like the rubber meets the road then [laughter] it back down to the ... really level well like I said oh I Want to talk about the ... the work he joined us have you done workplaces [noise]\nUh-huh and this is Google but it's other places as well and you also worked I think with social activists\nYeah a lot [noise] well I just remembered this year the freshman at Amherst College had they all had to choose a three day orientation and their first week of school and out of four hundred entering students Seventy chose\nMeditation and yoga so there's a big change so I'm\nThe first day you know I was teaching them mindfulness and having them you know watch their breasts\nWhich had just arrived on campus they were and they had like worked like fiends you know to be able to get ahead and do you arrive on campus yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] so I left a lot of space for I'd say ... I teach the practice and then I'd say so any reflections on that any questions\nAnd then be dead silence [laughter] okay well practiced a little more and then I'd ask you know buddy would make themselves vulnerable enough to ask her right hand right so I decided\nOh better changes around so I I'm excited to give them a practice of mindfulness an object and I gave them each a leaf and\nThey were to bring their awareness to the leaf and then as distractions arose let them go and bring your mind back to your lease\nSo we did that for five or ten minutes which is a long time to you know usually you look at all leave and you say oh okay I said All right and and I didn't really expect that anybody was gonna say anything [noise] so I left a couple of moments at the end no but he did\nAnd then this one football player in the back row\nRaised his hand and he was he had become in my mind the person who most was kind of resisting right make him so vulnerable and anyway\nHe said can I say something to Jeff in it like you said\nI Love my leaf [laughter] oh\nIt was so beautiful yeah and then they all started talking about how you know what it was like to really look and look and look\nAnd it just made me realize that you know it's so much easier to\nDo the things that we've done\nWhat I Know that some a Christian groups called crimes against creation when we're so out of touch with nature and I'm so huh that one moment when it gets kind of this window into what\nWe need to remember in order to make the right decisions for the future\nIt also um you know sometimes I feel like we we hit the twenty first century and I I think that's that's kind of spiritual technology right meditation and mindfulness and contemplation and yeah yeah it's all it's like we like we're discovering all these other technology and then we're kind of\nWaking up to the spiritual technology that we just need to go back to our sense as almost I mean I Wonder a lot about you know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and whenever\nYou know well we're always engaged with our phone and I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do All right\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look around and I mean I Know there was bored I Know there's no\nRomance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world and we were standing in yeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which\nResearch has found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students are also we at the end of the day we didn't that the yoga and and a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day but his son\nTo show us in a deep relaxation and everyone has ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass thin and I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and about lying down for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter] right well\nOkay so I knew were denied all that beautiful work as Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google for loved that she put her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but\nLike most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then\nYou stop take Syria deep breaths follow your brass\nIn and out and in and out and in and out\nAnd then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever ... we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it it was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go\nAnd um they all said that was a radical knows me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what he said\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nAll right so you know I mean\nThere we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really see I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often\nWith activists is that if I give up my anger will I lose my motivation right and\nIt's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others helpless is the understanding that\nIt's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand for repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to notice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and
