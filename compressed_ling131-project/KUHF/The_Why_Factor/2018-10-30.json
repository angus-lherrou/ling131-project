{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "There are a couple of things that professor ... said in the in the last segment I'm utterly I Would love to get your reaction to and especially given what um you both have been saying\nOh one is that Republicans will always come home and the second thing is\nIt's not like President Trump created this moment that ran it actually we are the ones who great at this moment we're in the president is the one who is is desperately exploiting it\nAnd I guess my question is a ... a Charlie is what does it say about who we are as a nation and who the Republican Party is now under Trump that\nIns are coming home based on a message from the leader of the party that is based in in fear and anger and bigotry [noise]\nWill it says something rather appalling doesn't it um but uh no doing is absolutely right when he says that the deal this this dysfunction these divisions\nAre these dark things in our in our culture were pre existing conditions before Donald Trump came along I think he's he's made it worse um I Do think that this is where moral leadership can come in where you know you could have a leader who appeal to the better angels of our nature he hasn't in fact appeal to the exact opposite\nBut he's also absolutely right that that there's a very cynical calculation here the Republicans will swallow anything and we were watching him radicalize his supporters that people hope people understand that that by becoming more extreme and behaving you more radically he\nReally is testing his supporters and making them by in taking them further and further he is radicalizing the Republican Party\nWhich I think is exposing itself as being essentially without fixed principles otherwise why would it be so willing to follow somebody like a Donald Trump so it's an extraordinary moment and unfortunately we've had one moral test after another which are the party of my former party has failed\nA Christian and before you both before you also responded just wanted to say that the uh New York daily news is reporting right now that police are responding to the New York times building in midtown\nAfter report of a suspicious package there was a nine ... nine one one call that came in ah right at eight o'clock right as we were we were going on the air and so I just wanted to get that out there ...\nI mean that's not surprising I we have to remember also that Trump is not a politician he is a salesman and so he knows how to sell these ideas and a lot of these uh elected officials Republican elected officials are in for opinion for a pound and a lot of ways and so they've ... so many things\nThat they've they've started to cherry pick\nRight well I don't really believe in this part is you know how he frames these things that I I Believe in you know the tax cuts or whatever it may be but now we have to recognize that if you're in with Trump this isn't a line item veto you are with him full stop\nWhen you go to Michelle who's calling in from Honolulu, Hawaii Michelle thank you for calling in to America on the line\n[laughter] thank you for taking my call um [noise]\nI'm truly I Am truly getting more

in squirrel hail and my brother in law and sister in law did live there for a while they live in North Carolina now in Raleigh Durham area [noise] fight when I hear a president call himself a nationalist\nWhen I hear him say things like I'm sure they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and refuses\nTo call out ... and the and the dark underbelly of our country and the [noise] the whip up his face the way he does [noise]\nI quite frankly this shades\nOf Nineteen thirty seven and the songs that were\nMailed and thank God thank God none of them went off for when I when I look at that when I when I watch the national geographic and all the history of how Hitler came to power\nAnd it was through fascinating political rivals in calling for media [noise]\nFake news fine saying history repeating itself and scaring me to death\nMichelle thank you very much for for calling into German Shepherd was calling in from from Honolulu um there are a couple of other things that that happened in the news today that I Want to get to in the two minutes that we have left one the ... the administration is going to send fifty two hundred troops to the southern border Charlie is that even legal\n... is probably legal it but not if they act as soldiers I mean they're going to be their first show this is part of the president's attempt to keep ... ... you know focusing on the the invading hordes\nBut no they're they're they're not going to be you know having guns are not going to be meant mouthing the rampart they're not going to be shooting at a at dead members of the caravan though this is a political gimmick in order to continue to exploit the fear and hostility about a caravan poses no real threat to this country\nA and a real quickly casino the president's going to be on the campaign trail pretty much every day until election day a week from a week from tomorrow he says that if the ... ... um yeah it it Republicans don't win um he's he's not going to own it is that even possible\n... listen we know that this president moves the gold posing and sadly enough people in his party let him and if he loses due to a blue wave on November six he'll say that it's not his fault and it's you know blame everyone by himself and unfortunately his party will just let him do what he's been doing to the past two years\nAnd we've seen this movie before Christmas Charlie Sykes
