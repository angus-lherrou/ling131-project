{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Making this kind of political statement even all the way back to Justice Thomas and people have gone back of course that they need a hill hearings because those are the closest that we have to what happened on Thursday of this past week but but even Judge Thomas at the time while he\nWas angry and better and you could hear the emotion in his voice he didn't burst into tears\nAnd aid he didn't make the kinds of of just overt political and part is statements or the judge Kavanaugh did on Thursday so much the way I'm describing it as a judge Kavanaugh went down the Trump ban road I he added the kinds of emotions\nThat Trump brings to the the political have stains and he added the partisanship and the kinds of divisions that Trump has made the new\nIn American politics and now in Supreme Court nomination politics ...\nIt's very I'm Glad you brought that up because as I was listening to judge Kavanaugh's forty five minute I'm opening statements there last Thursday I kept thinking that this was not for the American people this was not for the community this was for and the\nThis was an audience of one speech an audience of one opening statements ... ... what impact do you think that will have going forward whether he is confirmed or not on judicial Supreme Court nominees but also on the court\nI think it was as you say an audience of one for certainly the president to try to maintain his support for himself judge Kavanaugh that is but also the audience of Trump supporters that they got a referral to beer\nAnd and liking beer seemed to be going for that Trump being base so to\nYour point what happens if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate and put on the Supreme Court\nI think it's going to be hard for people to see him in that neutral arbiter role that I thought that now chief justice John Roberts described so eloquently people can disagree if they wish about the analogy of a Supreme Court justice being the umpire and calling the balls and strikes\nBut that is the uh the height of that sort of the platonic guardian view that we have a Supreme Court justices they're supposed to be again above\nThe fray and they're only\nHuman but I once interviewed a Justice O'Connor\nAnd I asked her about being a woman and how that had an impact on certainly her appointment and maybe after and she said you know we're all the sum total of our experiences but when I Walk through the door of this court every day\nI Try to leave that behind and I think she really did try to do that and I think most of the justices have had done that and that's why the court has these very high approval ratings certainly compared to the other two branches over the last fifty years\nProfessor I I'm just wondering Kim people given the ... the overtly person statement statements made by judge Kavanaugh if she is confirmed to to the Supreme Court um see if he becomes the ninth justice\nAnd you know litigants go before the court and he's there can people demand that he recused himself from there and it landed but it's\nUp to the judges and justices themselves to to recuse so it wouldn't it wouldn't help for someone to make that argument they can make it but if he doesn't choose to do so he doesn't choose to do so you might recall some of the controversy about\nA Justice Scalia in his friendship with vice president Cheney right and whether or not he should recused so it's up it's left up to the judges and justices that the federal level to do that\nBut I think that's where it will be hard for people to give Kavanaugh fair shake in the sense of looking back at what happened on Thursday and saying can he really step back now and be that the objective arbiter calling the balls and strikes without any partisanship or favor\nIn a little bit of time we have left the winter uh ask you a process question here because we're longest time you needed a Supreme Court nominee needed to have a super majority of the Senate\nSixty votes to be confirmed and now all the attention is now focused on depending on the day senators Collins Murkowski mentioned in West Virginia now you only need a simple majority of the Senate to confirm Supreme Court justice how did that happen\nRight well you might recall that that's been a tussle between the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate and the filibuster went away I'm under the Democrats for the lower federal courts the district courts in the courts of appeals and\nThe Republicans got The Revenge by saying okay we're staying at a four Supreme Court nominees I'm sure now the Democrats are rude that day um that they went down this road but recall that back in Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine and\nJustice Ford is was nominated and promoted up to chief or attempted to do so by Lyndon Johnson he was filibustered to death he did not get through and get that promotion to chief because he was filibustered by conservative Democrats in the south and and conservative Republican so back in the day filibusters could prevent someone from going on the court\nA real quickly you I'm recently quoted you recorded in peace in the uh about Trump's reelection strategy might hinge on the Democrats taking either the house and Senate or both if Democrats do have their blue wave how would that set up a Trump presidency in twenty twenty\nRight so my point there was presuming there is not in in a successful at ... impeachment\nIf if the Democrats would take back both houses present mean there's not an impeachment and a successful conviction and the Senate right that would be awfully hard because it's hard to see that the Democrats would get the super majority still needed by the way for the impeachment to to come to a conviction\nUm my my point was actually to go back to Harry Truman looking at history and and say you know give them hell Donny Truman last\nUh in the mid term he lost the Senate to end the house Republicans buddy gave him hell and he came back and had that improbable when a Nineteen forty eight so if history is any kind of predict or could be the case for Trump should he run in\nAnd twenty twenty or So Professor
