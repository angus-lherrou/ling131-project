for her and\nShe's saying she's saying she's taking the ... the president's line that you know young men are are the victims here Christian is this ... is this a real\nA real thing out there um that we should actually pay more attention to take and take seriously as a\nA a line of thought that has a lot more a has a lot more adherence to it than we're willing to admit among women will see justice\nYou can do is actually looking at as well as you do looking back through all the research studies and one from a earlier this year I tried to understand people's attitudes on\nAn accusations of sexual assault sexual harassment and they asked people how big of a problem do you think you know a variety of things are in in society today and they said how big of a problem do you think it is that women are not believe\nAn eighty percent of Americans said they think it's a problem that women are not believed um\nThere was a gender gap on how intense of other feeling that was for women that was it was more this is a major problem versus a minor problem but he presented as a problem that women are are are dismissed too often however at the same time Seventy six percent said they think it's a problem\nThat some women may make false claims that the idea that you one hundred percent believe all women may go too far that that you and said you should take all women seriously and that that may be a safer standard\nUm that takes women's claims very seriously to make sure that makes sure they heard but doesn't completely dismiss even the small possibility of false claims or miss remembered claims that sort of where the the polling data\nComes down on on where voters sit and one of their number they think it's valuable to point out the Quinnipiac University polling around the cabinet case specifically\nHis tended to show you know more opposition than support for Kavanaugh more said they believed Dr Ford than than judge Kavanaugh and their accounts of of what happened\nBut nonetheless about half of the respondents in the polls still said that they felt judge Kavanaugh was treated unfairly in the process and and so you know I think that is that is something that is fairly widespread even if you think on balance\nA Dr Ford you know something horrible happened to her she should have been believe maybe you didn't want to have an ought to be confirmed this idea that the process we just witness\nWas not one that was well structure to get at the truth and was unfair to everyone involved easy it's fairly a somewhat widespread belief\nSo the question for listeners was I'm back to the original question what do you want in a in a candidate someone who fights hard and take the prisoners with someone who inspires and tries to unite us in the less than five minutes that we have left I Want to go to Donna in Everett, Washington Donald thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nDonna\nOkay well I ...\nI worked for Bernie Sanders' campaign I was\nA delegate for Bernie Sanders and I think he was an excellent example of someone who fight hard and attack his other enemies but has a uplifting message and he certainly was sacked oriented did not want to get into dirty politics\nAre right ... thank you very much for calling in from Everett, Washington we're going to come clear across the country back to the east coast and Alex calling in from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Alex thank you for calling into America on the line\nHow do you want a fighter or do you want to know what I wanted to comment about your anger you're sure\nWomen are anger but after hearing your female caller from Wisconsin I mean for me it's just an absolute despair you know it's just there that women could see the man for young men as being the the mind in the middle of all of this I mean I\nDon't even know what to think that any more than one year old Don\nI mean I just I don't understand that I don't even know dialogue with people like that I don't I I cannot see anyone\nIn the house have mentality that cabinet nominees victimized during any part of that product that when he did was they eat I read it every every question was asked about his behavior so I can understand I'm woman feeding him\nFor his family and that no I mean the point in our culture where we can't even talk about I don't know I don't even have to worry\nAbout any morning gathering minutes\nAlex I Want to I Want to thank you very much for calling in from from Philadelphia and we've got about a less than two minutes left Karen Finney um can you address the despair that Alex Alex fields and all this\n[noise] sure look I think part of the challenges this is a nuanced conversations that we're trying to have\n'em and I think if I just go to pure politics uh you know the Republicans played it quite well so that\nYou know and I do feel bad for a Mr Kavanaugh's family I mean it it did have the the whole process wasn't handled very well and I think that's initially what upset a lot of people\nHave that in Nineteen Ninety One all over again feeling a literally looking at some of the same faces sitting up there a ... and feeling like we haven't changed we haven't learned and yet as women we felt like we'd come so far so I think there again as I mentioned before where\nThis is you know there's so many different tensions here and we're trying to have sort of a nuanced conversation in politics which is a hard thing to do\nUm and I hope that uh I Hope that she will get out and vote and hope she'll encourage her son to vote\nKaren Finney ... is Anna ...
