{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Chris thank you very much for calling in from Newcastle Delaware I mean Chris is that like why bother to do it they're not going to get rid of them so why why waste the time and enrolled\nThat is the point I was trying to make the time that this really worked was with Richard Nixon\nAnd when it was a similar situation but what happened was we were in a similar situation to right now and then there was a smoking gun and the smoking gun was the tapes were turned out the president had been lying the whole time\nAnd then the country as a whole including Republicans turned on that President and decided it was absolutely unacceptable to have him stay in office and as a result not because they had a change of heart themselves but because the American people how to change of heart Republican senators\nShows to throw him out of office\nAnd there was a famous story that two Republican senators Barry Goldwater and Howard Baker went to the White House and Richard Nixon said to them how many votes do I have in the Senate\nAnd Barry Goldwater said you have twenty which obviously isn't nearly enough\nAnd I'm not one of them and and the Nixon resigned because he could see the handwriting on while the handwriting was from the American people\nAnd so when we look forward there are going to continue Jonathan to be events that are going to show that this president is not just lawless and breaks the law every single day and breaks the constitution every single day but did he is really dangerous for the American people\nLet's go to New England and John who's calling from Portsmouth New Hampshire John thank you for calling into America on the line\nAt a [noise] I Want to say that uh I I like the president I don't believe it should be impeached at all\nAs far as the commenter saying that he is is that while you know the last president he he did a lotta unconstitutional things what things he was trying to do in an area by talking about how\nThe Democratic party is becoming a moral party that wants to pass laws\nSpecially sodomy laws like for the gay people\nOkay John John had plenty to say I'm ... and\nQuite frankly Tom there are a lot of people who agree with a lot of if not all of what John from\nNew Hampshire has to say and in fact that made me remember that\nThe latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows the president's approval rating has picked up five points to forty seven percent how do you get the American people to rally around the cause of impeaching to president when the president right now is seeing a boost in his approval\n... we've always felt that we have a lay down hand on the facts and B that events would Barris out and let me give you an example Jonathan that apparently is not convincing you but to me is an overwhelmingly important point I'd say two weeks ago\nThe United nations came out and said that unless we get our climate crisis under control within twelve years which is twenty thirty\nThat we will be subject to on imaginable suffering\nAnd the president we are the only country in the world that is not part of the Paris accords on climate because President Trump has tried to get us to withdraw it hasn't been completed but he stated officially that we are withdrawing from that were the only country in the world\nAnd when being and when this report was described to the president he said I have a pretty good feel for science I have no idea what that means as far as I'm concerned means absolutely nothing\nAnd he's continued not just not to take steps to move to clean energy not to take steps to reduce pollution that actually has tried as hard as he could to increase pollution\nAnd to therefore not just risk but to go towards on imaginable suffering for the American people so when you say to me you know we can just wait\nWe have two years actually what are the scientific body of the world told us is we have twelve years to solve the problem not to start solving the problem\nNot to give it the good old college try to solve the problem so when someone says to me let's wait two years I Know that we have twelve years\nTo solve a problem or face unimaginable suffering and when the commander in chief says I Want the American people to suffer unimaginably my point would be let's get rid of them as fast as we possibly can here we've got less than\nTwo minutes left and I want to go to Donald in Honolulu, Hawaii Donald thank you for calling into America on the line\nThat they get so much for having me go ahead\nWell I mean I I Would say no I mean I think that the Democrats are really a kind of stop and narrative of of uh we're going to teach them about one because uh the problem really isn't Trump I mean the problem is a culture and our country that deeply divided about\nSort of what's acceptable in terms of values and beliefs and I think in teaching Trump believes in going to solve that out of the vision and two I think it feeds Trump's narrative of the Democratic mob and the\nThing that the Democrats are trying to do and not only helps to empower\nOther Republican base and get them energized and so and then and three probably it works against democratic kind of already difficult a messaging and the fact that they're messaging is already problematic and since that they don't have a clear and cohesive message center by throwing that out there it's so extreme that have just serves that kind of model everything out\nAlright Donald thank you very much for calling in from from Honolulu in less than the minute that we have left Tom\nI'm ... that's an interesting point the problem isn't Trump it's the culture or is it both [noise]\nWill obviously Mr Trump is supported by the Republican Party pretty much without exception\nSo to say the problem isn't Trump that it's true that he represents the entire Republican Party not all of them agreed with them to begin with they have now fallen into lock steps behind him so it's actually unfair to say that somehow they're separate because they're one in the same as\nFar as Tom ... thank you so much time blue thank you very much for being on America on the line when we come back to the panel is going to come back we're going to talk about this and other stuff\nSupport for Houston Public media comes from inner faith ministries
