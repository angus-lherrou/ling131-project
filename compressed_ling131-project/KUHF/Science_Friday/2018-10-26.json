that the software is written from would be available for the public to examine or at least even if it's proprietary software that I'm certain authorized individuals' independent of the voting machine makers and election officials would be able to examine the software afterward\nVicious think I'm ...\nThis is Ira Glass of this American Life and you hear these pledge drives come you have them go chances are you have never donated to this public radio station and I think the reason why is because you think that we are talking to someone else and I just want to say we're not talking to somebody [laughter] we're talking to you look at yourself right now you\nAre someone who sticks around and listen to the station even during the pledge drive [noise]\nWhat does it say about you look at your own behavior who argue who is the person who listens to the public radio station even when the pledge drive is going on this stuff I'm saying right now the here and come out at a radio it's not even interesting but yet you did not turn the station what does that say about you [noise]\nIf you were actually trying to reach you personally\nIf I knew your name I Would say it right now [noise]\nAnd what we're asking you to do is an act of pure ideal is\nBecause you're listening to the station for a while chances are\nYou know rationally that you don't need to call you know the station is still going to exist I'm not supposed to say that you're not supposed to say that during the play started the station is going to be fine it's going to exist even if you don't call you know rationally because you have never called and we've all stayed on the air without you and so for you to call is an act\nOf pure id listen you're doing it even though you don't have to do it which makes it even better [noise]\nAnd the thing I Would say is that those of us who work here we're working here out of ideas were working here because we believe in the mission of his radio station and I just have to believe that if you're hanging the sound of my voice right now\nIf you listen all the time if you stick around during the pledge drive you have some small viewing of idealism about this radio station\nOr at least you find it useful in your life [noise]\nI Do that's why I pledge joined me and all the other people who act on that I deal with them even though you don't have to because you know that it's you know that we're talking to right now don't do I don't delay [noise]\nDo it now banks\nThe number to call his eight eight eight nine zero eight seven we can get on line of Houston Public media dot org yeah we're not talking to people who aren't listening we're talking to you because we know\nYou're listening to the station you're counting on it for information every time you are getting their car to commute to work you turn on the radio expect us to be there and a return you launch the up and want to hear the news while you're on the treadmill or whatever else you expect us to be there will\nWe kind of expect that if you're in a place where you could give financially but you do that that's how we\n... we were able to be commercial free and nonprofits and thoughtful as

U. H. T. T. V. eight point six years of service of the University of Houston\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi saying the FBI has custody of a Florida Man in connection with an ongoing national\nInvestigation into suspicious packages including confirmed pipe bombs address to several high profile Democrats unknown critics of President Trump's\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions says Caesar say August charges five federal crimes including interstate transportation of an explosive threats against former presidents and\nAssaulting former and current federal agents if convicted he faces up to fifty eight years in prison the suspect is a registered Republican Jeff Sessions announced political violence\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence through further in a gym\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law\nAt least Thirteen suspicious packages have been intercepted the FBI warns there may be more former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others were targeted no one has been hurt\nThe Trump Administration says it's considering a wide range of options to stop migrants from entering the United states NPR's Tamara Keith reports this comes as President Trump has made immigration a central focus of his pitch to voters leading up to the mid term elections\nWhite House officials are not denying reports that President Trump is considering an executive order to close the southern us border to migrants including asylum seekers\nThis as he continues to raise alarms about a caravan of migrants traveling slowly through Mexico to White House officials tell NPR the administration is considering a wide range of administrative legal and legislative options to address what they call a crisis of mass illegal immigration\nOfficials say they don't intend to quote forecast to smugglers or caravans what per se strategies will or will not be deployed\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending at least eight hundred US troops to the border likely including engineers and military police officers camera Keith NPR News\nSo it says what about this brunch of math can we understand that is similar to this other brunch at math at all so similar to this other brunch\nAnd what was going to do is be really lazy about it because I don't want to have to do the same thing over and over again I don't know about you but I hate doing the same thing over and over again so instead of doing that we're going to make a theory that will do it for us and that's what kept me theory is you know\n... just for jeopardy going further into the weeds aren't we [laughter] we read how to tell us about she specializes in a cat and\nCategory theory specialization in something called what is your ... uh well actually I work in infinite dimensional category the loans [laughter]\nIn a way to think about what that does is if a category provides a template for a mathematical theory so there are the mathematical objects which are like the mountains of the theory and then there are the transformations between those objects which are the verbs um but as\nMathematics becomes more complicated uh we need sort of a more robust\nLinguistic template to describe um the the objects that mathematicians like Rebecca care about so we might need pronouns additives ad verbs propositions conjunctions introductions and so on\nAnd so that's where the Internet dimensions come in and we have not only the objects and the transformations but there might be transformations between transformations like the home and told me that turns a\nDonut into an infinite dimensional plane and with a whole punctured in it\nIf I can add to that because I have to admit I'm also an inside cat grief ... you picked\nThree mathematicians in two of them in front of my son has to be the truth\nBut it really I I've Emily says very well it's all about having more nuance so that we can talk about things with great great subtlety\nAnd that's something that we both believe in and I'm sure that form I ... I Believe in because things on just right and wrong unfortunately in school my things or from right and wrong and that often wrong but there's so many ways in which things can be the same I'm not the same as Rebecca said\nThat a coffee cup can be considered to be the same as a do not I'm just like we can consider relationships between people but we can also ...\nRelationships and say well whose relationship is better but then we can say well maybe this relationship is better because they have more fun but this other relationship is better because they don't all very much and then we could compare the ways of comparing and say well which is more which is that there is it better to have more fun or is it better to avoid arguing and this is another way that we get\nMany you know you just explain why Lewis Carroll wasn't mathematicians right I mean Alan Stern you just had a scene out of Alice in wonderland justice growing\nUp possibly something like that and the wonderful thing about Alice in wonderland is that it's anything is possible because it's happening inside someone's modernization and that's a wonderful thing about math as well\nBut on the one hand you might think it it makes it difficult but we can't necessarily see untouched things because they're not physically real but the great thing is that when not constrained by physical reality either when Romney constrained by our own imagination and\nSo if you have a huge imagination that means you have a huge capacity for thinking about mathematics\nSo that means that if things that you described may have no\nGo consequences in reality they may not described nature or reality at all but it just mathematically works when it's beautiful\nThat'd be fair\nThat sense I think you're really asking a philosophical question they're right because I think many mathematicians feel like they're really discovering something that is and it is under the context of some\nBase set of assumptions and of course category Therese are very very concerned with those assumptions are extremely important um but a lot of times when you sort of get into the weeds of something you're going to make some assumptions\nOnce you make those assumptions there's a tremendous amount of very beautiful mathematics that kind of fall out from the assumptions and from your agreed upon language let's say\nAnd many Massachusetts they're like they're really discovering things rather than um rather than inventing them so that's a little bit of a philosophical thing as an invention or is that discovery and um you know most most of the things even in very basic mathematics to talk about it's not that we have a concrete\nThing to say if I said what's a number you wouldn't really have an answer to that question except that you can count things but then what would be the number pi or what would be a negative number we don't really have a concrete object but we very easily our minds are kind of set up to understand math and I much broader sense than just\nA has to be physically there and physically presence and the consequences are very real I mean you couldn't put a man on the moon\nWomen on the moon [laughter] if you weren't able to kind of odd to be able to do calculations that involve things like real numbers which we don't have that kind of create a thing to talk about we just have actually our our minds to get our heads around it\nAll over all of us who saw and read a missing figures will know exactly what you're talking from\nYou know hidden figures didn't vote for him as the great thing about the the interaction between math on reality is that you might not start out with a particular aim in mind you might not have a specific application but if you do some beautiful and profound mathematics then often some unexpected application will come later\nThat nothing will often not expecting and this can happen ten years later it can happen a hundred years later\nThree hundred years later for example that the number theory from hundreds of years ago is now the basis of Internet photography maybe thousands of years later the platonic saw that the cost of heating from two thousand years ago didn't appear we weren't we didn't find examples in nature until the Nineteen fifties\nAnd so focusing on direct applications in life is not necessarily the best thing to do but focusing on something fundamental and and beautiful but it's not necessarily real just like thinking about Russian and a\n... vote Lebanon but you can describe a pathogen fiction and a half people say uh-huh I Know what you're talking about but when you tell people what your dog hunting about how many can really understand why you see beauty there\nBy say everyone can what does everyone else think Rebecca no\nWell I definitely think that it depends on what kind of level you're talking about when you say it so I think that I almost every single person I've ever talked to I can find\nAn interesting mathematical question that they can explore and see the beauty in but of course it's also true that we get very specialized and then we talk to other people who are also very specialized and I don't see that as particularly different than what happens in any technical field that there are some questions that are truly very interesting that say Emily would find really interesting but I\nHave to say about something that um someone else might not um and that's okay because she's a highly trained enough dishes that there's there's a conversation we had there but I but I Do think that there's access to every everyone at some level depending on your background\nWill be back in a moment with more from our panel of mathematicians but right now I'm going to give you a simple equation to solve your support is the key variable that helps keep this public radio station running smoothly and bringing your programs like science friday so please call now with the pledge of support here's the number\nCall eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight eight seven or you can do this on line at Houston Public media dot org\nYou're listening to news idiots seven on day failing the news director here we are in the final hours of a campaign designed to help pay for the news and information you rely on day after day including these programs like science friday but now you know there is no substitute for local reporting for\nThe crisis occurs your donation help support the local journalism center Houston Public media\nDuring his day Elizabeth trouble or immigration reporter\n[noise] were you listening to our fall campaign all week and waiting for the right moment to get involved this is it we are here today on the final friday of the news eighty eight seven fall fundraiser and we're hoping to hear from you\nRight now the most reliable form of funding for this twenty four hours a day news service comes in the form of your contribution ten twenty thirty or forty dollars a month\nThis is going to be a success we know that Houston will rally for great journalism today just call triple eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or you can go on line at Houston Public media dot org\nEach week or a flu to master fully interviews the best and the brightest minds of science you hear what they're thinking about and working on explained in terms or accessible and understandable\nScience friday connects you with the world of science and the community of scientists were often here sort of Houston zone experts discussing astrophysics astronomy this question comes with a cost\nAnd the most significant and reliable source of funding for programs like science friday\nComes from listeners like you that there's one your gift matters this is why your gift matters but community is counting on you to do your part\nAs a special new benefit of Houston Public media membership you have access to an on demand a library of public TV programs through TV eight passport if you're not ...\nAlready a member a sign up as a news eighty eight seven sustain or we'll contact you with a special code to get access to more than a thousand hours of on demand programs like American Experience and great performances Ken Burns nature and know that\nGetting ready to a binge watch at home or on your mobile device kick off your membership and start binge watching at ten dollars a month become a member at triple eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or you can go on line at Houston Public media dot org\nAnd everything you so much for calling them taking time to call this afternoon John from Galveston\nAnd there is a bit like that you know if there were gun\n[laughter] let me let me ask\nA are you a question of the that has been a I have talked about over the years I and I'll do it this way I was once asked to create a panel of women physicists\nAnd so I approached every notable when woman physicist that I knew when I asked him to sit on this panel and not one of them said that they would because they said we don't want to be known famous as women physicist\nWe are physicist regardless of gender we're physicists who happened to be when it\nDo you feel the same way about math women mathematicians\nI mean you you must have faced the probable problem of being a one woman mathematician and uh you know in a field of many amendments\nCourse I'm happy to jump in but I Would like to to see if everyone else would like to speak first\nWell I say something about that I I think that this is probably something that in part was the specific women that you spoke with I don't think that everybody feels uniformly the same about this question\nBut I think that many women have kind of common experience as a they kind of progress it their careers\nBoth at the early times and then as a kind of go through things come up and different kinds of ways and different stages of their career\nAnd I think at least speaking for myself being female within mathematics has a definitely played a role for how it's come out whether that's good or bad and so if somebody kind of identify as you as a female in the field of course you don't want that to be the only thing about you that as a\nViable their fifty percent of our population is female I hopefully that people would be interested in hearing also about my mathematics or ideas or other kinds of things but\nI don't think it's irrelevant either if it if it were relevant we wouldn't have such a shortage of women and mathematics it wouldn't have\nSuch a difference in at um achievement levels that we kind of see in society amongst those people who do get higher degrees in athletics and so I think it's a very real issue that has social consequences as Emily was talking about\nEarlier in the program if if you can't have a community you really don't have mathematics as the no at so if the community becomes one in which they are very few women or which women are discouraged or which women don't don't kind of\nGet to the same places man that I think it's it is an issue and so it's hard to both acknowledge it's an issue Andrew refused to kind of\nRecognize yourself out in part of that conversation whether it's your mail in your part of the conversation or you're a female and part of the conversations\nYes I agree and when I was younger and I was just starting out I really also didn't want to draw attention to the fact that I was a woman and I didn't want to give anyone the opportunity to say that I wasn't good enough because I was a woman and then I became more violence\nAnd I became more secure and Michael permanent job and I was respected in the community I became more I became more I'm active about it and at the situation haven't improved I think enough that women are still very underrepresented\nI realize that we need to do more and do more actively wants to take more responsibility\nFor putting myself out that if I complained that the images of women of images of men in mathematics as presented by the media are largely\nOlder white men then I Need to put myself forward to help dispel those images and so I realized eventually the I needed to do something more active and make myself more visible\nAnd I was very inspired actually by mathematicians like anybody who works in my field coming on being much more active and I'm a vocal about those issues\n... you're a mathematician but you're also ah sports sports woman you played rugby right [laughter] however is that different from being a woman ... different than a similar bring a woman and sports\nAre well and so I Would just come back from a sabbatical in Sydney where one of my main collaborators lives and uh there I'd have kind of funny experience of going to the Australian the center of Australian category theory for seminar and I would be the only woman out of about Fifteen mathematicians at all levels and then I'd go directly from that to\nA training for Australian rules football where there would be fifty women of all ages um so it is a quite a transition but at this point in my career I'm a mostly attentive to how underrepresented\nTen along ... but other acts he says well affects my students so when I teach a\nSort of a large multi variable calculus course to you know three hundred and fifty incoming students at Johns Hopkins I'm I start with a comic\nI'm an ex ... by Randall Monroe entitled how it works and what the comic as as a ticket to stick figures out a chalkboard ones dry and then a girl and the other walks by and says well you suck at math but then in an identical panel right next to it that the person with the chalk as as a female and the\nCaption is now well girls suck at math and I use this comment to explain how it's harder for students who feel like they stand out in the sea of faces in the classroom to ask a question and to um really engage with the mathematics in a way that I think makes it easier to learn\nTo do do are there any other any other of stereotypes or you know that that you\nFace as mathematicians women mathematicians [noise]\nAgain I don't think I'm Sorry [laughter] I don't I don't think all\nThe stereotype and happens along gender lines so I'm a for instance there's a you know one of my\nOne of the people I'm inspired by John Herschel who was a a a guard for the Baltimore Ravens um but recently retired from professional football to focus full time on his PHD and applied mathematics at MIT so\nYeah so I agree that it's not just about gender and I've been proposing that we should change the words we use about gender so that instead of thinking about masculine feminine behavior we should use known agenda prescriptive was such a descriptive as part to trade instead\nSo I've been proposing in ... in Congress is to replace Mexican and feminine and the idea is that ... ... it's about going into things and not really worrying too much on Congress about bringing things together in Congress and mathematics\nIs ultimately very Congress has to try to understand things and we collaborate a lot together yet mathematics is presented in ... and it's tested impressive either tests that are competition that's about right and wrong that problem solving competitions\nCompetitive atmosphere to get into get PHD places to get promotions\nWent in the end the massive suddenly that that we do is about shedding light on situations and making connections between situations and so if people have put off by the end of course is packed with sticks of mathematics then they'll never get to the point where it becomes beautifully compressed of\nRebecca golden presser a department of math science at George Mason university your junior ... at school of art Institute of Chicago and Emily rail system where President Obama map at the Johns Hopkins [noise]\nGreat discussion on math will will start to drift off to come back and bring them back on TALK more about uh stay with us we'll be right back after this sometimes complex math can make your brain hurt a little but the math involved\nWith this radio station finances it's not hard to explain it costs money to provide the programming you here and enjoy each day and yes that includes science friday and when you were in the numbers support from listeners like you is a key part of the equation\nSo please showed a station how much you value their programming now with a pledge and thank\nYou I think you're ... you're listening to news eighty seven on day feeling the news director here we are the final hours of a campaign designed to help pay for the news and information you rely on day after day and reporter was one of those things right now science friday\nBy now you know that there's no substitute for local reporting what a crisis occurs your donation hope support this local journalism center Houston Public me meeting media and joined me right now is a little trouble who covers immigration for us\nWhen we started Houston Public media's fall\nOn air fundraiser it was our hope that the drive\nWould be a success we'll put your money together with dollars raised in the mail and on line to fund everything you hear a news eighty eight seven that's how this public media thing works you do your part we play are is keeping you informed with quality journalism twenty four seven\nPlease the as generous as you can as soon as he can and help out\nDo that at Houston Public media dot org or call us now and we'll help you make a difference that's at\nTriple eight nine zero nine zero eight seven colors that triple eight nine zero nine zero eight eight seven\nWe return so many of you this afternoon and it's so great to hear from people from all over the Houston area oh we love to hear how news eighty seven and NPR improves their lives so if you really would come and when when you call is here's here's one of them from Jonathan from Houston\nHe says I'm a new member thank you for making the morning Dr great I've never given before but now is the time to put our does on people who still for truth and high standards I ... to stand with me so stand with Jonathan than what the fuck support independent journalism and be part of something bigger than yourself please give now at Houston\nPublic media dot org\nOr calls at eight eight\nNine zero nine zero eight seven eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven\nAlso wanted to say thank you to Darcy from Houston Sheryl from spring Alice from Houston and Richard from the woodland thank you so much for your donation\nHow many times have you gone to
