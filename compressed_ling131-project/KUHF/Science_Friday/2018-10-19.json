started building societies of robots where they had different abilities what would that be like and that you know of course is a whole other can of worms\nYou're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd even though we're living through the most\nContentious political year in recent memory there is so much more for us to talk about I think we invite you to explore culture education race and identity and

you and ask you to protect free and fair and journalism in the public interest NPR PBS and news eighty seven are different time and again\nThey're the most trusted sources of broadcast journalism in America you support that when you gift to Houston Public media right now I'm joined today by my colleague Josh has ended tell us more\nThat's right it's the second day of news idiot sevens fall campaign and we are scheduled to be fundraising through eight PM\nBut we can pool or resources and cut this fundraising in this day of fundraising rather in half if we can happen if we raise a total of a hundred thousand dollars a we are are getting closer to the goal but we need your support you can buy back science friday all things considered and marketplace\nAnd if we reached that goal

that it's right or wrong but it's really important and that might try to get to ask him shake their quest to pursue particular calculation but it's really important to always be open minded to the other point of view\nAnd that's what this is one of the strengths of this book Clifford is that you have a dialogue with the book the cartoons they\nThe novels based on two people sitting together over a cup of coffee or in the train and they're having a dialogue about something questioning each other's beliefs asking them to you know give them their opinion and sometimes not agreeing but then trying to find you know some common ground belief there\nYeah and I was trying to I I was trying really uh to celebrate that kind of conversation which are no disrespect to some of the wonderful\nA science books that are out there but it it didn't seem that a lot of them sort of clean up the discussion in a way way you lose that that conversational aspect and the messiness of conversation which is which which can be quite engaging so I tried to represent\nThe kinds of conversation in the book\nAnd and really show the various kinds of issues that get people into heated debates and a man and then tried all sorts of shows that it it it it's just by no means clear research doesn't work in the very simple way that these these sorts of um which Saudi one debates are often presented\n... we have some of the working sketches for the book up on our website mix to the finish panels people can find that at science friday dot com slash physics but I Wonder if that process of refining and revision in art\nIs really all that different from the same process when we're working on a new physics theory refining rewriting finding the beauty and the equation\nYeah yeah is it a go ahead you\nKnow it's just gonna say I love that aspect of the book I think that's so important um exactly what you're saying Clifford that a lot of science books are kind of coming down from the mountain and again that is respect as they are wonderful but with the answer it\nAnd really the process of discovery is very very nasty and very exciting that's half the thrill and and as I was saying in the sketches you see this kind of wonderful process of discovery and uh and and getting deeper and better it'll closer to some kind of representation that that you're really looking for\nDid you said ... did you set out to do with that way or did you wind up saying this is the only way I could do it\n[noise] I'm\nActually a a vote I Want to say Eighteen years ago um I first had the core idea for the book which was to\nTo have dialogues I really want to ... to be up front I wanted it to be a more that your your your being invited to be part of or at least to a witness conversations about science\nAs opposed to having the news brought to you from on high as it was so that was the core idea and then I thought it would be really engaging\nOr two maybe see\nWho these people who having the conversation and then later on I thought hey it would be fun to see whether having the conversation and then gradually over a number of years um those elements those visual elements became more and more important to me and it wasn't until about um two thousand five two thousand six when I realized oh wait I should just use narrative\nOr art for this and then I realized oh this is a non fiction nonfiction graphic novel\nUm that or I should just I should just make this thing and so that was that was the beginning of the of the final journey of are starting to draw it talking about the the\nDialogues conversations about the nature of the universe with Clifford or the Johnson and I'm also a gentle Evan tell them you tell us about your nova\nIt was a real experiment and also digital representation and that's a different situation because unlike cuss words back which I really admire particularly because of the single authorship drawing it himself I mean that just really has my\nMy admiration and this is a big collaboration it's a big team a lot of people involved in the writing in that direction and the production and a lot of scientists interviewed for it and each getting there are signs that it's a completely almost the opposite end\nOf that kind of creative experience but one right though I saw I think that I get to fly around in a spaceship I mean he doesn't want to do that I fall into a black hole I mean you know yeah [laughter]\nWell let's bring up ... in the book and the dialogues it appears that the black hole on if we understand the black hole\nWe might be able to unite the two on United all parts of physics now which ... which is you know the training grand unified theory gravitation and quantum physics ... is that is that when you set out to write the books\nDo you use that as a major theme you wanted to show that we might be able to unite those there\nUm it wasn't one of the main things I Want to talk about but it it it did come up a number of times because black holes are tend to draw you in a both physically a narrative Lee I'm a among other things and in the in the field of ... a research I'm a theoretical physics trying to understand some of these questions\nBlack holes have become central because they they lie at the cost of the the the best we know about the classical understanding of space time which is on science theory of general relativity\nAnd a and an an quantum mechanics somehow black holes turned out to be this wonderful test bed for any new ideas you have about quantum gravity how space and time\nWork on a mechanically which is one of the big quest uh it it you have to test it against what black holes are telling you and how black holes behave and and sometimes it is either I'm Single swims on how well it base in the context of black holes have become this wonderful a low bar tree of ideas\nYeah absolutely I mean we we talked a lot in the shower about black holes how nature actually make fan and theoretically they're incredibly interesting that for a long time even Einstein believe nature would protect us from there for a nation that they wouldn't be possible\nAnd the fact that nature thought of a way to make calls which seems to involve killing off really big stars as a death day is phenomenon that what ... absolutely chair that almost more importantly\nBlack holes are a fundamental landscape on which we can act out the the most extreme scenarios that involves the clash between\nThe physical a small scales and quantum mechanics and the physics on the largest scales which is the curb space time and it's really only there were maybe in the black hole that we have a way of getting crews and evidence even theoretically by pushing the mathematics of what's next\nBecause that's where they meet ... yeah you're right the are both elements that are seeing it seemed like a reconcilable are reconciled well they they have in our mind right [laughter] how was reconciled yes indeed and and\nSo you know and it it goes back of course one of the most famous names in the field is Stephen Hawking and it goes back a somewhat too to some of the work that was going on at the time in ... including ... but most famously hawking radiation her I ... which are\nNeeded save that thought out after a break [laughter] well it's a good place to go back to talking radiation ... Johnson and Janell Evan oh we'll be right back after this break stay with us\nWe've been talking about the head scratching physics of the universe and how to make that science accessible at science friday we try and do that each and every week\nAnd if you value easy to digest explanations of complicated information and deeper insights into the universe around you give the station a call right now with a show of support here's how to help\nCoal eight eight eight nine ... nine zero eight eight seven were visited Houston Public media dot org and it's eighty eight nine ... nine zero eight seven you're listening to news eighty eight seven on Michael Hi grief from ... to update you and what's happening in Houston Public media's or fall fundraiser\nWe just come to you a couple of times a year to ask for your support so that we can have three hundred and sixty five days of news coverage ended up conversations and analysis and old commercial free so we just ask if you\nGet involved in supporting journalism that matters in your life with me today is Courtney lamb who's the head of our fundraising effort you're a Houston Public media with more details on why you should join\nYes good afternoon you know when you think about supporting news eighty eight seven it's because you seek out fact based journalism\nAnd you go to a place that makes you feel smarter and the wonderful thing about supporting news eighty eight seven it's not only does your gift provide this programming from the BBC and NPR and our local stories that we cover every single day in Houston and the\nSurrounding area but you also support curriculum based educational programming there's so much more that goes into Houston Public media every time you get a gift\nAnd we want to ask you to say to think about that and to make your gift right now you can call eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or go on line and make your gifted Houston Public media dot org\nAnd Houston is a very very smart town we've got a course always oil and gas engineers who could master if you get into space ago some of the world's best doctors at the medical center in all the other institutions and everything in between\nBut to science friday mix science successful to all of us you don't have to have the PHD or or any other degree you can just to learn about your world we were just marveling it\nKind of the weird disturbing but fascinating world of termites and whatever else you learn on NPR every single day you go home until a loved one or heard the story today and it just in lightens your world and of course science friday is wonderful addition every week that\nYou know exploring the world of science specifically in that part of our universe and so\nIn other words we now are talking more and more people talking about Halloween tangled in is real own but we don't see it enough in the ... or it's just now entering into the mainstream where am I reading that wrong ...\nIt's actually a becoming in the last few years uh that's changing rapidly in a very positive way I think there are many times in various discussions\nI'm a going back decades where we would touch on some of ah the the the the more sort of full on aspects of quantum physics in our discussions all of black holes and things like that\nAnd uh but we back away and and then the conversation but come back later on and we'd again sort of back off from the fully quantum description this time round by revisiting a lot of these old questions about the nature of space time and quantum physics and what have you with perhaps better tools and better intuition than we've ever had\nAnd those tools include full on descriptions of things like a entanglement from quantum theory and uncertain so full ... to the point now\nThat they're all toy models that people work on where you actually discover space time as a sort of approximation to an underlying reality which is much more corn to mechanical which is much more about\nAh entanglements so space time images as a as a sort of a derived object from an underlying quantum reality and those sorts of things we're hoping we can build into a full theory of how the world works eventually\n... circus going back to one of the main point to me before because we're we're running a little bit and I mean we could talk about this forever but let's talk about the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room which is a black hole heavier than me [laughter] he's he's the black hole gunk gonna be the Rosetta Stone for physics\nYeah I mean I really feel the black hole is the key to providing us evidence it's giving us close all the time and and as we experiment even just in pen and paper on the surface of the black hole\nIt isn't that gene us ever closer to some revelation and and I I think it may be what do you think ... yeah I\nI I think it ... as I said before it it it it has this this pool of both both a literally and metro ... which is ... which is interesting in that it showing of the ... the concepts of black hole and the the mathematics and physics at the black hole lead you to shows up in so many different areas of theoretical physics um\nAh both directly and indirectly\nUh and uh that's really interesting to see I think his ... there's an interesting history story that's going to be told about that and um but it's also an instructive physically ... Ito astrophysics is the obvious place um [noise]\nUh now an a whole new ... new way because of a colliding black holes giving us gravitational wave signals that we can detect a expanding astrophysics in a huge way but then you come to questions of ah the corner of nature of space time et cetera and again black holes seems to be\nA central that but then through things like string theory you find that the properties of black holes even abstract properties on the page black holes in strange space times if you work out the mathematics\nSometimes turn out to be powerful ways of re costing other kinds of physics which you can actually dress up to look like the physics of black holes for the sake of doing a useful calculation\nSo black holes are becoming this sort of you bake it to this concept and ah even a tool box for doing physics so it is quite a remarkable um idea\nIn case you're just joining us talking with a clip for Johnson author of the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe and we're also talking with a gentleman who is ... you got to notice the nova specially the same title of your book black hole blues\nNets black hole apocalypse [laughter] yeah it's not black hole utopia [laughter]\nUm I called the lenses\nActually so named because ... won the Nobel Prize for the light of this\nVery of the ... black holes along with kept throwing bay there that clip we just mentioned um ah gave me the title because he said to me like a month before the discovery if we don't detect flat halls is how things a failure [laughter]\nWell I'm thinking of things we haven't discovered that is the whole idea of the theory of everything is that guy is there still possible lead time that's been talked about for decades\nYes ... that's really still in some sense of what what cliff words referencing when when we're describing the black hawk difference it can drive us towards that theory of everything it will be interesting if it turns out to the theory of everything it's best to unify the matter forces which is a lecture week\nUm and strong currently which we can be unified and gravity gravity is really the outlier know it might be interesting if again as Clifford said it turns out that it's only matter forces and gravity is this illusion that emerges from the quantum phenomena that man it's just something that we see on large scales that doesn't actually fundamentally exist your\nCountry the way I still have a second act to the dialogue or another book and um\nI I I I uh ... the original book as originally proposed was about four hundred pages long so I I cut out to vote to I'm a enough for almost a second volume I actually think it would be fun to revisit uh some of the same characters are having other conversations\nBut ... but in terms of the physics which is really the starring character\nI think I Would probably delve even more into the quantum aspects and so I Do in this book I I think there's some wonderful things going on as we've already talked about in the ... and the confidence of understanding space time and and turned them into things like that\nThat deserve a visual treatment that they really haven't been given and there's something about the language of a narrative sequential art comics if you like\nThat lends itself to physics more than almost any other form and uh I I I think this is just the beginning of of what one might be able to do so as an experiment I'm curious to get going it just you know it takes a long time\nAnd I can say that I can tell in and then it's beautifully written beautifully drawn very well thought out the easy to read makes you think and\nIt's beautiful books great work you and thank you very much clearer Johnson author of the dialogue this conversation about the nature of the universe he's also professor of physics at University of Southern California and co director of the\nLA Institute for humanity they walk and talk about that some things that John eleven author of black hole blues and she's also professor of physics\nAnd astronomy at Barnard and you can see her nova series can streaming\nYeah again jak great to see it\nWe've been talking with Dana Lebanon separate Johnson about our amazing universe and how to explain it you know each day this station helps to explain your universe and helps you make sense of the world around you but they can't do it without your support so please give them a call now here's the number\nEight eight nine nine zero eight eight seven or you can visit our website Houston Public media dot org or their Michael haggard he from Houston matters team and we're continuing Houston Public media's brief all fund raiser and you can help us continue to import to continue to uh\nTo grow insisting that agreed to important news that we provide every single day and he's wonderful insightful or conversations that we have the science every Friday on the show and news and politics and the story telling that happens on the weekends and everything in between\nHow much can you afford to support used in public meeting and maybe it's just ten dollars maybe it's ten dollars a month a hundred dollars a month whatever you can do potent thing is you're listening now you ought to become our next donor and supporter here's Courtney land would be to\nYou know as a not for profit listener supported radio station news eight seven is a community resource that is only successful when it is supported by you by the community this is a campaign to raise money needed to bring your news from NPR's the b._b._c. and our local news reporters here in Houston Public media\nAs we approach the mid term elections the need for resources to support news eight seventh coverage is critical will be here for you now will be here for you tomorrow will you be here for Houston Public media\nIt's important that you call eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven that's eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven or we can go on line right now and make your gift at Houston Public media dot org\nAnd maybe a few years back you saw an episode of nova nature or whatever it was a documentary that gets your mind excited about science and maybe you\nDecide to explore that and it turned into a career down the road you're an engineer or an environmental scientist or some other person that works in in a few connected to science or maybe a well that and that's your chance to kind of like paid for paid back for everyone look at it\nAnd the ... more content that someone else here some young person right now here's an interview on science friday and it takes them down a path rabbit trail to maybe becoming a scientist themselves are exploring some other career path in their life or just loving science ... does not a career as just a\nPerson who wants to understand their world so\nIt's your chance to kind of pay it forward to the rest of the community and of course continue to hear a great conscience of you get to benefit from as well\nAnd that's why your gift matters the community is counting on you to do your part", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Houston",
