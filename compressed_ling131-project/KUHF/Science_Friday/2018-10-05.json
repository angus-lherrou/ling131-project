is it healthy or do they give them nutrients from ... in in the wrong I mean [noise] that's they produce the stuff that they the dung beetles eat\nPossibly um so what we think is happening is that you know some some bacteria are bad for beetles but some are good in the sense that they have this\nUm arsenal of metabolism that is um could be useful and breaking down plant material and plant material is not\nParticularly easy diet for any organism to eat that bacteria are really good at breaking down plant material and so the Beatles secondarily benefit from that because I'm the beneficial bacteria are breaking down to the plant material that then the beetle can feed on\n[noise] not all the wrong Beatles happening potatoes okra\nNot all species have them um from what from our own studies we found that um some species have them some species don't have them uh the species that have them have them at different levels in different populations so I'm the incidence a\nPopulation that I found in North Carolina the Beatles their ... many more of them have these worms than for instance the Beatles in Indiana\n[noise] or people can get worms overlooked and where's the worms and help people\nI'm not personally but there's actually I'm a lot of really exciting science that's coming out about how ... worms do benefit people I'm so they've been finding that in many cases because\nI'm obviously worms have some bad effects on people as well but in cases where they're not killing people and people are actually tolerating worms um\nThose populations tend to have a lower incidence of autoimmune diseases\nAnd they're actually starting to suss out the mechanisms behind this um in order to not be adjusted from humans worms have evolved a way to suppress our immune systems\nAnd so people who are predisposed to having an auto immune disorders like multiple sclerosis or Crohn's disease or type one diabetes\nI'm actually benefit from the suppression of their immune system so\nSo you're in other words bring people in societies where people have these parasites and the system are are getting less strict from these other diseases that is correct that so we're not saying go out and get a\nNo no so definitely these words also have bad effects too um but with scientists had been trying to do is find certain chemicals or proteins that the worms are are providing to these these host to suppress their immune systems and just give\nPatients those chemicals or proteins instead of the whole world [noise]\nDid did did you always have this interest [laughter] ... noodles or follow them as a kid you know on the ground\nI kind of follow all organisms that I can find a catcher see 'em and it wasn't until I I started talking to my college friends that I realized these organisms that are a little harder to see 'em\nAre actually really interesting and can be found all over the place and we're just starting to scratch the surface of why they're important to human health and an ecology in general\nSo where do you go with your research firm here [noise]\nUm that's a great question we um are definitely in the process of finding how widespread I'm this phenomena is by looking at other a species of insects but likewise we were really interested in how their engineering the micro biome and whether it's because they're\nEating certain bacteria allowing other bacteria to grow or if they're emitting chemicals that suppress the growth of certain bad bacteria or enhance the growth of good bacteria\nUm that is a little bit of a black box that we don't really understand yet\nWell we wish you good luck well thank you and you know do you have a lab but full of dung beetles women [laughter]\nThey're ah they're very surprisingly easy to keep 'em\nYour

Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell\nA and then the moon is ah like I say about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual well moving that big ... well it's certainly unexpected right when you look at the moons and our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are there all ... significantly smaller than New York so\nUh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size ... tune\nThat ... sort of a raises new questions for people ... how do you get something ... that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this was potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it's such\nA it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of right doesn't look like that and this case\nUh yeah it's funny you know there's there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact our scenario like how we got her ... ah ... coalescing out of a disk materials whirling around the planet and the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons ... Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally ... capture scenario like Neptune largest moon try ... as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it's certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah yeah we like it when they scratch their [laughter] how do you how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but ... detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the trends that method when the planet passes in front of the store from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the store like that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness with the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nAt in the nineteenth century and the more I looked the more I realize that was completely not true and you really have two things going on you have as you say the rise of the industrial revolution and\nWith an enormous tidal wave of industrial chemistry all kinds of new and creative different compounds that you can add into food and drink and just about anything\nAnd then you also have\nThis amazing wild west of food and drink because there is no regulation and no requirement to label and it's in that period that you see really food fake curry and fraud and the\nKind of profit use of really dangerous compounds uh be permissible and so businesses who are cutting corners are trying to make a little extra money as you say would put all kinds of\nReally odd unexpected things into food but they just didn't have to tell you why and that's where ... came in\n... this is science friday from WNYC Studios talking with Deborah Blum author of the new book the ... okay so why only comes in and what does he do\nWell as you said there's no consumer protection legislation whatsoever at the federal level\nAnd there is no after gay so this tiny laboratory of USDA the bureau of chemistry is actually the only laboratory in in the United states government that's assigned to look at food safety in food quality and Wylie had come from Indiana and he was the first professor of chemistry at Purdue\nWas a real sense of mission about the integrity of food and drink kids studied fake county in Indiana at honey that he said had never even seen\nYou know a beef fly over after I had a nice way with words like\n... and and so this was you know corn syrup died yellow was a little fake honeycomb crumbled into it and he brought that kind of sense of outrage is very moral about science that has to be science in the service of good and so when he came to the federal government\nHe just started that laboratory on investigating food it was the first time the government had done that\nAnd he starts piling up these investigations of dairy products so\nCanned vegetables of spices and cocoa and coffee and when you read them they're called bulletin Thirteen they're they're really of food and drink core story and they horrified consumers when they saw them but they really horrified businesses\nBecause they couldn't faithful to do this without anyone knowing and now you have a troublemaker and the government\nFan or this is also the era of ... Upton Sinclair is famous for jungle than regular about the same time\nThat's exactly right so there's the title of my book is the poison squad and it's really about this very wild experiment that widely did in the early twentieth century\nAnd what you get so frustrated about the lack of regulation\nThat he persuaded the government to less let him tests preservatives and other bad things on young government employees\nThat and that's a about a couple of years before\nUpton Sinclair writes a novel called the jungle that is about the way we produce meat and and he was I think people forget it you know we think of the jungle is this incredibly influential novel but what made it so influential\nWas Upton Sinclair was also an investigative journalist ... hung out what's what Teddy Roosevelt used to call MK Rikers and so when he was working on that novel he didn't just invent food processing\nHe went to Chicago and lived in the Chicago stockyards and because he was a writer and he was so poor literally the people running the companies could not tell the him from they're underpaid workers seat was just a shabby and radical looking and so have you ever had I had a\nChance to interrupt you because we have to take a break but I Want to come back and revisit a Upton Sinclair and also widely in your book\nUh we're talking with Deborah Deborah Blum author of the poison squad we'll be back after this break our number April for seven to for eight to five five stay with us we'll be right back\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nScience friday's supported by the end\nAnd if concern scientists defending science to help protect people's health and safety learn how we're making progress at UCF usa dot org\nAnd by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at ... dot com slash friday support for science friday has provided by a grant from the John Templeton foundation more at Templeton dot org\nScience friday is produced by the science friday initiative a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing the public's access to science and scientific information learn more about their work at science friday dot com [noise]\nThis is your NPR station Houston Public media news have you traveled and support from Houston Public media comes from some rush makers of mango room ... ice cream record and we'd go bottle or middle would use the retailers recipes more M.
