I talk about how as a as an advice columnist um\nWe have these basic assumptions about millennials that they're spoiled and entitled an over confident in their abilities um and that their digital natives and they just use um their devices and it you know so easily and it's not it doesn't the they don't feel self conscious they feel great\nUm and social media is natural to them they don't mind taking selfies and posting them constantly that you know this is their natural world um and also that they're lazy and they're you know awkward and that they can't get it together and why can't they do better jobs they won't can't be led\n'em but you know from the letters that I read\nUm that's not what I see I actually see millennials with the same kinds of anxieties um and the same sorts of struggles that we have ... and that we that are boomers hat and that of all generations at 'em and you know the letters the letters that I get\nReally a lotta people describe I'm wanting to be a better version of themselves and not being able to get their um\n[noise] and you know they they they feel like they're constantly comparing themselves to others on line and it looks to them like everyone else is doing fine and moving forward and plowing forward and that they're the only ones who kind of a sabotage themselves repeatedly um but I remember feeling that way\nUm throughout my twenties just that I was always in my own way um I think it's a natural feeling that you're the only one you know even when someone says you're destined for great things\nUm you think but I Am not that's not possible for me because I Will find a way to mess it up and I hate myself from getting their um which is you know goes back to the greatest of all time kind of thinking it's like\nWhy why why wouldn't I it once you recognize that everyone just kind of in the same boat um\nAnd it becomes apparent when she talked to people\nUm then then it's you know you can actually tune in to the people and their truth and tune out of the messages that you're getting day after day and I mean it takes constant vigilance though\nUm suffer millennials I think it's ... yeah and I think it's a million times harder a million times harder actually because they were they've you know they grew up in the middle of this and sometimes they don't know\nWhere they and and social media begins it's it's really it's really fluid and and crazy and invasive\nUm and so a lot of what I talk about in my column is you know it really just boils down to the idea that there is no better version of yourself waiting in the future you know you have to work with what you have\nRight now and and also the quality of the the the joy of hard work um it's something that we don't you know it's not emphasize that much in our culture either we feel like we have to get places fast food you know get their quickly um you're on your way go\nUh but the joy of actually slowly patiently working towards something that you that you care about um is it is kind of a a joy that we've lost and it's something that I really had to re learn myself when I realized how much I Love writing every day\nUm and I wasn't tuning into that I mean I ...

successfully launched into and return from space missed bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies\nAnd brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says I Need a stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday thinks he has great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animals went into space wow what got you fascinated with study\nSo I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I\nBecame fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise] um I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study who they're very challenging [noise]\nUm but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a ... that my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome so square one of the challenges of working with school monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day and the life of a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree\nSo I'm from studying primates where there is female dominance um we know that sometimes they live in very harsh environment and bill females having that this is true and lemurs where the females have priority of access to resource may have something to do about where they live\nUm and how the resources are distributed a square monkeys war not exactly sure but of the seven species there's only that there's only two that we know of that are female dominant\nNow let me ask you about something I learned and is that the the the\nSquirrel monkeys have something called ... that we might consider it a strange behavior but for them it's called the urine washing\nYes I'm so this kind of became a side project in my research group because of a couple of students got really interested in it so\nThere's this odd behavior that's done it's not just were monkeys but ... do it to where an individual will your innate a few drops onto the palms of their hands\nAnd rub it on the soul of the foot and sometimes repeated on the other side\nI'm it it doesn't take very long it's pretty quick\nAnd we don't really have a good idea about why this happens if you look at the literature most studies were done with ... in captivity and different studies point at this point in all different directions\nUm some things that are being proposed are that it could be a form of sexual communication between adult males and females even thermal regulation as a way to cool down because for monkeys don't sweat\nBut what we found in our population is that juveniles do it much more than adults and um it also seems to be so that really ... almost rules out the the sexual communication idea because juveniles are doing it more\nBut it also seems to be linked to stressful situations so you know fights in the groove or some sort of turmoil and so one thing that had been suggested which I think our data support is that it's some form of anxiety displacement sort of like a stress reliever\nA much like you know bringing your hands when you're nervous or something like that um but we definitely need to dig deeper into that\nSo it's not like a territory marking no that out of your other animals do right\nSo that actually has being looked at a long time ago and a semi captive population that it's not territory marking it's not a way for 'em one individual to know where they're supposed to go to follow the group\nUm that doesn't seem to be the function of it yeah um but it couldn't be that it has multiple functions that could mean something for adults and something else for juveniles\n... you know we've seen we've seen issues where a animal cultures we're learning more passing their culture down from one to another do see that in ... at all so\nI've never actually seen a squirrel monkey use do what we would consider tool use in the wild um [noise] I I did hear about a\nSomething that sounded kind of like it in captivity so in terms of passing things down I Would think more that the constant proximity of the females with the juveniles and their constant communication I don't know what they're talking about\nUm but the the ... of forging could very well be something that's you know the juveniles learn by observing the adults\nThat's terrific I Want to thank you both for taking time of protests thank you for taking down to be with us today and he'd a stone\nAssistant

their lives after living years in the wild wild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth\nAnd then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born enemy do this and well like\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a compost is just showing you where north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north ... and more north east\nEast than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded ... what did they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic and what about their Olympic dwelling cousins and when you look fishy living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but sandman live impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys tech\nThat is pretty impressive and their journey\nCan be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and then they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis ah\nSame and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something\nMore broad scale and and the term we think they're using magnetic maps and information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of Sam ... lactic Sam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals\nThat were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish had never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd you and yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they not been laying law that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so than in when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
