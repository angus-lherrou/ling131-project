Low a sudden the idea for the ad hit me like a brainstorm this is the first time there would be no copy no package design new trademark he said it was really the beginning of a new creative revolution was one of those hasn't made history effectively\nAgain my dad is adamant that the whole ad copy and design were heads\nThere many possibilities here of what's going on George lowest could be lying or George lowest could have convinced themselves in some way that what he's saying about all this stuff is true or my dad could be doing the same thing remembering stuff that happened when it didn't happen or I suppose my dad could be lying\nI'd worry about those let her options more if my father was the only one disputing George losses version of history but he's not there's the photographer

that he's ever met George lowest as for George's version he told me I'm at a loss I don't know why grownups do things like that [noise]\nFor the story of my father objects to the most isn't about ad copy at all it's personal pepper Kagan Lois had gotten the Dutch master cigar cat and the TV spokesman at the time was his famous comedian Ernie Kovacs so my dad flew out to LA to meet him and they hit it off\nAnd earning an Irish friends to go to a vote or driving around and a lot of ... and in the afternoon\nThe new law but he ... he was not allowed personal law because they're short prayer

and very good about it and It's MORNING\nSo love unfortunate incident and but certainly memorable to me and what wouldn't you\nMy father recognizes that there are only about four people left on earth to care about this stuff it's just that he happens to be one of them and he cannot let it go\nWith a different personality I Would say I know when I got one and a ... near to may know why I have done or not done\nThat but I'm a a probable fallible fellow and uh\nObviously ... and I resent I'm being burned or [noise]\nThe odd thing about all this was my older brother John points out is that my father's never exactly been a champion of advertising\nAnd he never believed he didn't have a true believer in the business\nI mean I remember him saying to me as a kid or you know if you don't find something you want to do and really work at it you're going to end up like me a writer of short sentences\nFor them\nAnd so [laughter] it's a it's a little ironic you know because he didn't he didn't care and things here you know all those years he didn't care because I think he thought it was beneath them and the business in some ways nothing was not need them but\nWas not serious enough to care that much about and now he does\nI understand why he cares he's eighty eight years old now so it's like I said understandably is on his mind and even though he did campaigns for all sorts of good causes gun control nuclear\nProliferation Robert Kennedy's senatorial in presidential campaigns father's not quite satisfied with his life's work in advertising is\nUh there's broke John puff array a at heart to section\nAnd I don't think anybody can do proudly into the next world where the career built on deception even though no matter how well are you do\nAnd at the end of ... days theoretically the refugee resettlement program was supposed to start\nBack up again but then something weird happened maybe the resettlement it never really started back up again not full force\nWho did the numbers take Iraq okay which is not on the president's travel ban list the final one last year we let in six thousand eight hundred eighty six refugees\nThis year hundred thirty okay how come like what happened\nThey went through a process that came to a conclusion they fix their thing should started back up what happened\nYou know he searched around and found somebody who actually knows\nSaid he wanted to know what the hell was going on what he meant was what's the vetting process for how we figure out who gets to come in you didn't trust what was already in place\nSo when he announced the travel ban the White House pulled together people from across the agency's homeland security the state department National Counterterrorism intelligence all the people you'd want in a room like that\nOne of the people in the room was Barbara ... she was the chief of refugee admissions for USC I asked us see eye as being a part of homeland security that handles immigration she remembers their first meeting on day one of a hundred and twenty\nWe met in large conference room that was really full of people around the table and people are against the law and\nA lot of people a lot of people\nBarber says the way most people in the room or looking at it was like this the refugee program is already incredibly rigorous month sometimes years of interviews data collection security checks the people in the room where like we think of this is very safe but okay let's do better with Nico we already think is extreme vetting more extreme\nIt was real Eighteen the top people barber says everyone was on the same age our\nGoal is that this program is up and running again on Monday a hundred and Twenty one so we need to be very organized we need to meet quickly and\nGet the program through the other side and the confidence again and\nI talked to three other officials were involved in the hundred and twenty date group to still work in government and they all felt like Barbara let's put her back into it focused hit the target so they do it they need they divide into sub groups they write up a report it makes a bunch of recommendations are classified\nMy impression from Barbara and the others who worked on this was we implemented every improvement we could imagine to a process that was already tight\nAnd a final conclusion of this group of experts was if you Institute these improvements into the process that we already have\nFor sure it is safe turn on the program that guy so go ahead start admitting the refugees again with the more extreme vetting that you want it [noise] and then on about day a hundred and ten of the hundred and twenty days they hear back from the White House\nThe White House did not like the conclusion of this review and according to Barbara and the others I spoke to in the group the White House wanted it to change\nThat express concern about the recommendation to resume refugee processing of all nationalities and do you know which nationalities the White House was worried about\nTrying not to say this record\nI was told that there was particular concern about I'm slowly nationals\nDiminished ration specifically pointed to Somalis as the sticking point why\nWhat do you think [noise] I honestly can't speculate we don't want to start you know I honestly I to this day I don't know\nAnd there is no rationale the euro given like because Mali is like this for like\nThe rationale wasn't shared with me\nTo government officials confirmed this for me Somalia wasn't the only concern they said but it was a major concern was chief of staff John Kelly in particular was unhappy they said\nI think it was both one guy in the group told me at the end of the day the data didn't show that Somalis were any special risk\nSo after a hundred and twenty days the White House reopen the refugee program for some countries but not for a handful of countries who make up a lot of the refugees resettled here for Somalia and ten others including all the countries in the original travel ban the refugee program would stay suspended\nFor them a hundred and twenty to review got another Ninety Days\nMy boss asked me to think about options for how to address the White House's concerns\nBarber says she and the other members of her group or sort of at a loss for what else they could possibly review but they went back to work they came up with some more recommendations after Ninety Days in January twenty teen the White House did we start the whole refugee program\nBut it was like turning on a faucet and nothing coming out if you look at Somalia and it was ten other countries ... school year it looks like we will admit three percent we allow just the year before last year we admitted more than six thousand Somalis\nThis year just two hundred and fifty extreme vetting has gotten so extreme it seems that people can actually get through it barber says the changes they recommended shouldn't have had this effect it shouldn't have slowed things down so much others I spoke to from the groups at the same thing\nIt's not clear why the numbers are so low but Barbara and the other people I talked to said the White House just never supplied the staffing and the resources to carry out the new vetting a few people told me that the FBI in particular isn't staffed up enough to do the checks it's supposed to do\nAs a result there's not a ban and police on these refugees but the outcome is nearly the same deja spokesperson said the new screening procedures are undoubtedly making America safer they point to one specific example in Iraqi wanted for murder in Iraq who entered the United states through a refugee program and twenty four team\nThey said today with the new vetting procedures he would not have made it through\nThere is some risk with every immigration program if you wanted a zero risk immigration system you wouldn't have any immigration at all\nYou know my sense is that the out of the risk tolerance of this administration I'm\nVery very low with regard to the refugee program you know approaching zero\nBarbara thanks so I Believe the jets were denied us that they just want a different\nKind of refugee coming in if any come in at all and she and another staffer told me about various times going up to the hill to talk about the refugee program to Congress back when Jeff Sessions with senator\nDo that for culture yet another time she saw someone else who's now jump official gene Hamilton for briefing to screen for integration potential Hamilton asked the ability to assimilate no she said\nThat's something we've always taken pride in actually as a country and she told him\nThe standard for refugee resettlement has always been vulnerability how much can we do for you\nAnd how much you can do for us [noise]\nTo chase the day since he first reported that story the administration has cut the official number of refugees allowed them to the states for forty five thousand twenty Nineteen than it was going to be thirty thousand that's straight to say I think is they didn't want to play in the pledge drive because I think it is exactly what so many of us turned to public radio for\nOriginal reporting journalism at our coverage new facts\nBack to the real facts not fake news journalism that tries to shed new light on what is happening at our country and the world right now that work as expensive to do the episode that that's where it was part of took us four months to research put together in a good stories from Mexico Texas Washington Kansas\nAnd we live in this moment where every fact is contested\nRight where there is a daily battle over what happened in the news that day and what it means if you think it's important for the fact based media to survive if you think it is important for public radio to thrive and do its job in this environment I just ask you what exactly stop you\nFrom standing up for what you believe in and getting to this
