{"month": "11", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "You know there's no specific thing it's more of a mood and uh you know somebody says I I'm I Wonder if you have a horror story then I just start letting my head flowed in that direction but I never try to pull out any\nYou know sit tropes in fact I Try to bend the rules and been the tropes when I can so I don't have a set way of doing it really is all about mood is sort of like waiting to hear a certain rhythm and music and knowing how to follow it\nDumping into ... mood discussion how do you set the mood in a horror story you know because when you watch a horror movie there's so much going on there's visuals their sound is all just kind of stuff that helps how do you do that with just writing\nWell I think writing is a very visual experience and I'm I'm influenced by novels and short stories and comics but also by the cinema and by radio shows and by story tellers and I think you pick up on the little telling pieces of detail that is what makes the difference is how things ... male and what they feel like and\nAnd those things can be described swiftly and politically and you don't have to do it constantly or otherwise it becomes too much of an obvious gimmick but I think you have to be aware of the senses when you arrived\nI Know that some of your stories they're not just straight up you know terrifying works of horror you you also tend to sometimes a infuse a little bit of a satire and humor or especially with something like bubble hotel or something like that where does that sort of come from\nWell I I think that horror and humor are opposite sides of the same coin you know it's I think Robert block used to say that you know it's just that\nSomething that's really horrifying is actually kind of humorous if you look at it from a different angle and that's the same in reverse Mark Twain used to say there's no humor in heaven and what he meant is that all humor is based on somebody's discomfort\nEmbarrassment are paying and when you think about it that's pretty accurate\nYou've written for for a long time you've you've been a writer for several decades if you can describe it\nOr how is the the genres you write for especially horror or how they changed over that period in which you've been writing you know are are we still scared of the same things we were scared of Twenty years ago or ... or their new things to be scared of\nI think there's always new things to be scared but it's essentially the same stuff I mean you know the fear of the unknown pure what's gonna happen and a lot of monsters or just a stand in for you know fear of um the future of fear of the dark here what might happen to our family I think they just become a metaphorical\nAnd uh so to me it's the same things but the approach to it varies from generation to generation\nI think that a lot of suspense has borrowed from the mood and attitudes of horror\nWhere before it was a little different and I think that a lot of ... has borrowed from the more suspenseful pacing of of thrillers and things like that but I you know it it cross genres and and sometimes it just goes back to the roots\nI mentioned films earlier and I know that some of your works have been adapted for for film and television especially as the creator you know sort of seeing okay someone's taking my piece of art and translating it to the big screen or the or the small screen how how do you feel about that process well\nSo far I've been very lucky I mean you always feel as a writer that there could have been this or that but you know ... hotel was a story of mine and I felt extremely happy with that because I thought it was like Ninety eight percent my story and what I wrote and I felt very\nGratified and ah some crime things that might have been done and I think they've been very good to maybe not quite to the degree that bubble hotel was but\nI've been lucky I had an incident on and off a mountain road short story of mine that was adapted for masters of horror and uh I I felt it came out well and I have some things that are in the pipeline right now that I'm hoping you also satisfied\nSo speaking of of some of those adaptations you're happen Leonard series received a TV adaptation and just this year you released a new normal in a series of ... what does that series about\nWhether it carries is about two guys in east Texas warm when one is white and straight and very liberal and the other is a black conservatives are a Republican and he's gay and it's based on a people I Know or have known and uh it seems\nTo be probably my most popular series although maybe my most popular book is a thing called the bottoms which deals with suspense and ... and crime and\nA

domestic growth there GDP Growth\nAnd also um this notion of us versus um outsiders that is a triumph thing and all over the world right now and and for political leaders to be popular that's one of

China has done recently in recent years as um the whole ... wrote project where you know China is saying that we need to look outside the country and look at Africa and also other regions in the world\nUm and cut back on the dependency of imports from the U.S as well and that's why you are seeing that China's turning places I'm an Africa into what what some people would up on their back yard

leading the way last year China minted roughly ... billion as a week\nSwiss bank ... has been looking at the billion as data I spoke to the head of ultra high net with ...\nThe past year we saw a increase of roughly eight or nine she billionaires in China that brings the total number of ties to about three hundred and Seventy three\n... billionaires are mainly invested in sectors like real estate consumer retail\nTechnology and they are responsible for his second part of one four four trillion that for ... twenty Seventeen editor to the total wells up to a point I truly\n... billion as around the wild in twenty Seventeen became rich shot by a total of one point four trillion dollars\nThat's correct It's about fifty percent of the fortune ...\nIt doesn't say a lot fit trickle down economics does that it's so much wealth is being concentrated in the hands of just a few hundred people\nOr is it slightly differently I think what matters is equal opportunity with really doesn't economically is the ... to pay off please keep in mind that billionaires mainly are self made billionaire they're created something\nBut they're also for nurse and they usually take massive risks and expect massive payoffs show in technology so to say to up to Ninety five percent of the value created through new technologies for disruption as\nA five percent flow back\nTo society only five percent of the value is captured by the disruptor or the innovator to five percent may be a shoo in trouble for that we should focus on the five percent don't think we should also focused on that I Do five if when you start to tap\nRewards we shouldn't be surprised that\nThe only for hers also kept their risk appetite and if they do that we have job creation and Texas\nA few nine Chinese entrepreneurs became billionaires last year that's roughly three times more than those from the U.S and Europe what does this tell us about the growth areas in the world economy\nBut when you see in China and what is accelerating is the faith unleashed\nCapitalistic behavior of\nIt's an eight unleashed entrepreneurial spirit the China market is a massive market was a mess of film for consumers and\nAllows the entrepreneurs to scale their ideas or their business models they are benefiting also especially in the tech sector from a lack of data protection\nWhich allows them to test and improve their business models based on the data so in the tech sector the Chinese entrepreneur\nIs on phones if there was a\nLarge markets that can be scaled up\nBenign regulations\nAnd hands it allows him to for her too\nFast fast grow the business model to a certain extent sort of grows the speed of execution is significantly higher than in Europe\nYou do have some worries about this growing trade war with seeing between the U.S and China could that affect the wealth of these people\nIt will slow down the monitors ... off unicorns IPO's\nBecause he's a tech companies that have valued at more than a billion dollars\nCorrectly and those attack them for news they want to go public and\nSell their shares for the public Martha and if the public markets are difficult\nAs we have seen recently China ... percent of the United states is selling off currently its tech sector so they may be less initial public offerings and less wanted to say she was in China how ever pays by which many corners are created in China\nIs unstoppable as we see it a United States created sixty two of them China fifty to fifty five for that too so their country and all the rest of the\n... and it was this something you've been following the and the rise of Chinese billionaire particularly within the tech sector\n[noise] absolutely so what we saw last year as this rush of Chinese tech companies trying to go public\nIn fact um earlier last year in January and we were talking to these uh thinkers and they were saying oh we have forty IPO's in the pipeline and the and it became much more than that and I think what what about the mind of people's mind is\nThat they knew that the window was closing in fact if you look at the markets right now pretty much if you're you haven't gone public\nYou've pretty much messed up the window for going public um so so for these uh uh billionaires from the tech sector\nPart of it is all paper money your your money is only real until you cash out say sell your shares to another investor or or during ... um a lot of the the companies like PDD that we saw last year they were one of those that were pushed out of the door by her investors to go public\nUm massive amount of growth in terms of transaction evaluation jumping ten times in one year but all of this um the the the the real question that you have to ask is how sustainable as this kind of gross and also how sustainable as their wealth\nAnd what about the conditions in China that are helping all these companies do say well we had the judge to start talking about a load data privacy regulation deep data also the size of the market allowing companies to scale up so quickly and those conditions stick around do you think\nI think those are all the elements that um create mega apps like we chat and also I'm ...\nI'm In China you do see this phenomena where you have one cat company and then they try to lump in all kinds of products and create to perhaps that's not that common in the U.S part of the reason as ... probably because of a lower ... protection but also because\nOf a a lower awareness or a demand for a personal privacy in terms of data\nSo these companies are hoarding massive amounts of data in terms of where people are going\nAh what movies they're watching who they're talking to what they're reading what music they're listening to and all that data becomes a channel for them to potentially a generate revenue down the road either by advertising or commission or sales and income or products\nAnd ... do you think this tells us quite a lot about the sheets we're seeing in global wealth the fact that doesn't soon going to be more Chinese billionaire then there are in the U.S\nChina's got a bigger market there's more people it's not so much that China's wealthier because it's not it's not as wealthy as the United states of rural but there are a lot of people to buy you know if you invented ... in China and always shoulder to China and it would simply be worth a lot more than a few invented ...\nThat it has to and some have you talked about that with counsel young I have to wear in the process in the process it'll happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about\nThousands of asylum seekers from Central America now passing through Mexico on foot on this slow journey north as pot if that migrants caravan they say they're escaping drug related violence that hired and then what they want is a new life and you opportunities in the United states\nBut a lot of the photos are good and then with her and go willing we will reveal us we want to help her family ... we're looking at them because it out and if we want to know more about them\nBut it's difficult to happening with the military because I have to find a way to have a baby to carry him and not bags also making sure my tell us\nIt's been that complicated but it's it gets in a life and I\nFind out what we don't live in our country I mean because there are no jobs become in search of the American dream [noise]\nPresident Trump they believe the migrant caravan has been infiltrated by what he described in a tweet as some very bad people including gang members plays guy back he wrote this is an invasion of our country and our military is ...\nMy colleague Mike Thompson has been talking about oh they said one of our regular commentators the American economist Ellen ... his father was himself an immigrant to the U.S he asked us what Bush has might think about the idea of abolishing the automatic right to do this and ship three best arrived enshrined in the constitution\nI think what Trump is doing his uh his base certainly is for him on this and I don't see any problem with him trying something and then\nGoing to the courts and letting the Supreme Court finally resolve this issue it's a troublesome issue but it's not an as overwhelming has the caravan problem\nYes now how much influence do you think that we'll have the migrants caravan over the outcome on Tuesday\nI think you'll have a great deal of influence at minimum it will galvanize the Republican base which may have cool down a little bit over the Supreme Court appointment issue\nPicture I don't know a flotilla of boats leaving Kelly with ten thousand people are determined to get into Britain one way or the other that's about where we stand now they do have the right to seek asylum\nAnd the problem is that it has to be a credible proof\nThat they will be persecuted if they go home that requires a long hearing\nAnd so on so that you will have these people some of them will seek asylum that is legal entry into the United states as things now stand uh they are assigned a court date and about eighty percent never show up they just melt into the population\nSo the president's is planning to build tent cities are close and very nice tense in which these people will reside\nOnto a there are cases heard and that would be months and months and months rather than just release them into the population and hope they'll show up at a court date which most of them do\nSo much of this is about ... I mean the president sent more than five thousand troops to the U.S border even though I don't think these people are ... for months now it's it's about signaling ahead of a very important election isn't it\nIs about seeking linked to the second caravan that this is a useless exercise and signaling to the voters that he's a pretty tough guy and he's going to stop this ah on the other hand do you do have to get the troops in place remember these are not guys going to stand there with bayonets\nSpearheading a little Honduran children are these people are a lot of them are engineer's a lot of them are medical personnel or they're there to build a facility to hold people pending they're hearing and to make it has humane as possible\nThere was going to be plenty of votes as though things look America as an immigrant nation does something selfish descended from immigrants of lots of employees it's going to be thinking ... with the economy doing reasonably well now we need people we need work is to try and fuel that economy\nWell first of all we are a nation of immigrants are looking at me and my father\nWas an immigrant but we're a nation of legal immigrants as for the employer's attitudes look employers have always favored immigrants because over whether it was the Irish in Boston or the Jews in New York and the olden days employers like cheap\nAnd then there's the political\nThese immigrants will be if they become legal a democratic voters by and large the Republicans know that and that's another reason that they are against it and then finally you have\nA split here between an elite or which um feels good about doing humanitarian things and favors cultural diversity and the great mass of people who are paying the cost of cultural diversity in private schools and crime and hospitals\nDo you think it's a mistake to see these people is cheap labor though I mean why don't see them for the potential that they have a meal if she had great potential when you came to America these people could end up his brain surgeons and highly qualified and technical engineered like absolutely\nI mean America is probably better at assimilating immigrants than any country in the world if you look at the problems in Europe and other countries but it has to be legal immigrants you can't just say well\nUh I'm anyone who wants to can come into the United states we won't check to see if you're a terrorist we want checked to see if you've got drugs for criminal record you just come in but basically we are a welcoming nation I think Trump is not he keeps saying we're for legal immigration and we are but then he keeps reducing the number\nOf acceptable legal immigrants so\nYou'll protection for Tuesday a couple of weeks back he was telling us she saw the Democrats would take the house of representatives is that still you'll feeling\nThey will take the house and it's even more certain that seems to me that the Republicans will hold the Senate so we will have a kind of frozen Congress\nAnd once that was at the Hudson Institute in Washington pizza does the president has the power to change that is right citizenship Paul Ryan there it's hiring house ... says he doesn't\nReport rhino to do some reading and not speak so quickly is a very interesting article today in the wall Street Journal just was put up by a constitutional scholar [noise]\nThe the the constitution says that people born in the United states in under the jurisdiction of the United states subject to the jurisdiction there are that is the United states [noise]\nWell what does that mean uh it's up to Congress to write laws to say what that means the uh the men who wrote that amendment\nOr that's what we do we go back to the legislative history said subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United states meaning not owing allegiance to anybody else\nIn illegal immigrant those allegiance to his home country as well as the United states now Congress over the years has defined what that means but it is never addressed\nChildren born in the United states to illegals\nAnd we've had you know hospitals pop up along the border at various times that basically their purpose was to create what we call anchor babies women when sneak across the border had the baby in the United states we're not going to throw the mother asked if the child has been born here and as a citizen [noise]\nSince the Congress hasn't spoken\nThe president can write an executive order and shut the whole thing and to the Supreme Court this is not open and shut unfortunately the speaker made a knee jerk response my first reaction was what the president's crazy but then I read it and then I saw this commentary says you know\nThis is something that really it's kind of like the abortion issue or it's one of these things where the court's gonna have to look very very carefully at not just the written words but how those words have been interpreted over time my heart goes out to these people but\nYou know while we're great assimilation factory the United states doesn't need any more unskilled immigrants\n... we we we have far too many unskilled immigrants we don't have enough skilled immigrants that his engineers and so forth and these folks aren't engineers that are coming\nIf we let this two thousand in\nMemory going to have half of Honduras here and the capacity of the United states to absorb immigrants just like Germany were villages and towns are overwhelmed by Middle East and immigrants has its limits we cannot take in all of Central America even though it is full and into state and for the\nSo we're really caught on a difficult you know moral dilemma\nYou say these people on engineers but even at the point that many people have come to the U.S over the past generations and that children have gone on even if they had not highly skilled that children have gone on to become great success stories\nOr you know that's a very interesting question the way it works in the United states is generally go to a State University you do what I did with my family did we all went off to the state university and we got educated and we became what we are [noise] ah the way affirmative action works in the United states or one of these kids settled in Michigan\nOr ... then he cuts in line in front of a Michigan resident because he qualifies as a minority and under affirmative action uh it's not that easy you you can always say give us more people because they're children might become electrical engineers are but a lot of our own children have trouble getting into the schools and and getting access and so forth\nUp where I just advocated though is the kind of immigration policy that are liberal friends the Democrats you wish that we went to high end up voter registration costs of these folks before they cross the border a ... that that that that we have in Canada Country they emulate Canada is very careful as is Australia", "show_name":
