depression that's according to a study at the University of Pittsburgh and the United states\nProfessor Rebecca fest and the safest author of the study and asked us to tell us more about why this would be\nWell the why question gets at is what are the mechanisms I think we can probably all agree that he's experiences are distracting so when it comes to depression and anxiety\nThat we can probably assume that that would be one of the ... having a particularly experiences that solves\nWhen it comes to sleep problems oftentimes stress stressful events disrupt our sleep but this may have been years later so they were maybe there is a feeling of being unsafe in the world which does happen in the context of trauma\nAnd did you find differences according to age\nYes we did and they were quite different from what people generally tend to expect so we found a more a report to learning as in people aged between sixteen and twenty four years old so younger adults than an older an older people in effect it's intended to go down with age\nAnd that will surprise a lot of people I think there was a stereotype of the older isolated lonely person\nYes there is and of course we do also have long enough in older age out and bought at what our data is showing is is downward trend and this is of course a self selected sample so not everybody who is in a different age groups is represented in the in our sample but it's very comparable to what was recently found\nYou know a large a survey by the off the u._k. office of national statistics that which is a representative sample of the u._k. population and so we we are fairly confident that this is not complete fiction it is a really what people are feeling\nAnd were you surprised that more young people told us that they felt lonely it's a time isn't that when people are having a lot of transitions they might be moving away to college or you don't see any jobs leaving that friends\nYes so the first thing to think about is that is it is is maybe a generational issue is it maybe the younger people now of today are different from the younger people of of how they use and therefore maybe those ... those younger people are by these are older and that's where the differences are coming from\nI think we can safely say that's not the case and one of the reasons why we can say that is that we also asked participants to reflect on their life\nAnd to think about what were the times in which they felt more lonely and all participants of old age tended to say that he was exactly when they are and when they were young adults\nSo that that fits with what we actually found when people report to their own loneliness\nSo then we need to think about what is it about that age that might be associated we loneliness and indeed the things you were saying so transitions leaving home for the first time answering higher education or answering a job all of those transitions are changing your identity or sense of who you are\nAnd the way you relate to others because that is very identity base as well but also your social networks they're breaking informing breaking informing at that time it's a time full of instability when\nHe was some students at Yale University and an older than you do seem to know what it's like to feel lonely\nI was really excited to investigate because at some level of one issue for ages\nBut I feel like I've built up too much in my head and I saw it was like\nNot quite disappointed when I got hit but like I think pressures week is really oversold like speed it best week your life when the all your friends I was a bit so of underwhelming Bible\nI Wish I push myself out andme all to me I think loneliness is sort of feeling like you want to be able to talk to people but not knowing how like odd lots of like sort of superficial acquaintance friendships but\nI don't take up many if you look at everybody talks about ...\n... for me it's about ... the no free lunch you were part of the community that you're in Friedland sized if you're\nOn the weekends I struggle friends all around them much I Do like Sundays I as a family as well so I definitely saw the ones on days when I have a much going on\nA remote as well so lonely but for the loans like on a very devoted to the parents are just some friends on the ... food or do you live out the people can regional food if I was feeding circular\nMy window and it's just a law student I mentioned that it doesn't always last long so maybe it's a very normal thing to feel at that age and can often be temporary yeah\nSo that's that's another reason that I think uh we are seeing such high levels of loneliness and younger people is that\nAh when when they experience it they don't realize necessarily that this is something that can often be temporary\nAnd they also don't haven't rehearsed different ways of coping with it and what works and what doesn't which in itself might make it last longer so the whole intensity of the experiences is is higher because of course you don't know you can get out of it to or how to get out of it\nSo yeah that's very much that is very recognizable\nIs it possible that older people might feel lonely and the same numbers but feel like ... ... ... I don't want to say on the study that they feel lonely\nIt's very possible of course because there is indeed a perceived stigma associated with loneliness and by that I mean that people have the idea that if you admit to it on the nose and then you will be seen as somehow we ... and we did ask about that and we did find that that was a stronger among older people so it's very possible that\nUm it's it's not entirely clear why that's not the case as much and younger people of course\nI'm a but but indeed that was the case what's also interesting to think about is that we did try to to delve into that stigma and try to see well are people who admit to being alone they\nAre really negatively evaluate that are seen as weak arena adequate and we actually found no evidence for that so our participants our fifty five thousand participants were generally very kind about uh other people who feel lonely and very um positive about them wanting to reach out and help\nSo it is a perceived stigma but not so much stigma that actually exists and I think that's interesting to to speak about so that people realize it actually isn't as bad as they think\nAnd of course it's not a competition between the ages and if you do feel any medical ... ever age you all have some older people such as Ninety six year old Jack King isolated because that no longer so mobile I went to meet him in the town where he lives on the south coast of England\n[noise] really nice to meet you I live\nMurtha is as a prisoner for\n... role but my whole life or does it bought from Boston wow that's a pretty decent wrong about that last last you know for for for all of those are rooted in the last though so far the most terrible\nNow there's no doubt that Jack is someone who was also during history as as a prisoner of war during World War two he put on plays for the out of prison as fashioning stage ... out of rice facts heels and you have to rush it up a ... pie when food with ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Houston", "day": "04"}
