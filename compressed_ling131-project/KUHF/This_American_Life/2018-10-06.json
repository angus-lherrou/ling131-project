this American Life I'm ... sitting in for Ira Glass and you're about to hear this story the same way I did blind all I Know is that it's going to have a coincidence in it\nI have no idea what you're about to tell me so oh yeah and I land on me\nSo the story is I was a freshman in high school um at Bozeman high school\nIn Montana yes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in\nMy freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman disqualifies the demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle chairing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common so they decide to pair up room together and ride the bus together to be orchestra friends\nSo um when we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know 'cause we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the space\nNeedle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I have there is that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing the little games all around there and we won\nThe super troopers but you know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute and you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand and\nOh what did you go to ... really\nI didn't quite believe him about this but she looked it up it's true Cooper troopers\nI just did a Google image search okay but troopers and I'm seeing images of the little guy but wait is it a generic name or is it the brand name I think it's a brand name I think from what I'm seeing here imperial super troopers\nSinus or general coup a trooper\nYes [laughter] exactly [laughter]\nBack to the plot here Hannah and her new friend Lindsey go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to trout their prices\nSo we we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and ruin approve of troops over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really yeah and we were just like in heels of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice in our friendship\n... become best friends all through high school cut to senior year four years later another orchestra trip this time to Reno nevada hennan Lindsey or in their hotel room studying\nAnd so when ... sitting at the desk in this hotel room in Reno nevada\nCase in point my name is Joanna ... sixteen years old\nJuliana she's got a problem with her grandmother\nMy grandma has been obsessed with the coincidences and she finds them in her life all the time and she always wants to tell everyone about that and we kind of annoyed with\nThere's some type because she just\nShe thinks is so incredible and how to ... all the time and it's just you know it's every time we see her oh my gosh you would not believe what happened to me and they're always um you know I was at the hospital\nAnd um you know she hasn't she takes a cousin to the doctor's office quite a bit for playing the ash and she'll be sitting in the waiting around and then um\nYou know they'll drive and they'll get lunch after that and they'll feed the people they were waiting and waiting room with 'em at the restaurant and I've always you know I always thought that was funny because it's like ... but you know maybe they're just trying to get lunch to like it's\nNot the deal [laughter] yeah oh I\nDo I file as doing a project in the English class reading that scarlet letter book\nUh-huh and I was um once I finished the book I like\nAnd project what we had to come up with what our son was and what we struggled with most [noise] and um I just envy so we had to create our own letter paper and then we had to like safety pin it to our shirt and wait around school the entire day so at ...\nAnd coloring in my letter and cutting it out um my mom was listening to the show monk in the background as we are watching it [noise]\nUm I was literally like cutting out I laugh line I'm I'm a letter E. for energy and it said on the show and studied to seven fans and the most prominent want an end in\n...\nAnd that was cutting out my letter and so I immediately called my grandma and was telling her about it and she was like oh that's a good one yeah and then I didn't really hear back from her after that and I thought like oh I should just any\nOf my friends [laughter] and\nI was like I can watch that you just happened to run into a person twice in one day I Do that all the time we know what an odd as I'm cutting out its letter eat they would talk about that on\nA show and I was so confused about it\nOkay so Julian his coincidence is a common one we've all had those moments when you're reading a certain word and then someone says it on the radio or on TV but remember Julian sixteen so maybe this is the first time it's happening to her so I'm On her side here I think it is more remarkable than her grandmother's example of the people in the waiting room being at the restaurant\nDo you do you have a phone where you can dial up your grandma right now\nI can try try it okay one second\nTo Julian accomplished her grandmother and so we could settled us\nAnd here it ain't Olson Elaine Olson nice to meet you nice to meet you dear\nI laid out my argument for Elaine but the purity and therefore superiority Julian has example but he laid argued right back there were several hours between the two sightings plus the restaurant was about four miles from the hospital\nAnd in that for a mile radius you might say I could have gone to any number of restaurants that fact that I ran into a at at that but I think is why couldn't it\nI think she could've gone any place\nIt's to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have not supported Elena me I'm really you know it was just been like look\nBeing with the daughter of the ... of the other woman your dad loved I mean it would [noise] can you find someone else [laughter]\n\nHow do you take this Clinton empty did it come to mean anything to you or to ... [noise]\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I Wish I had had yeah\nAnd then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life\nAgain to think that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know and\nYou know it might actually held his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this and that somehow you know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named Esther they've been out maybe eight times\nAnd I thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking about asking you're on a friday date that I had um set up\nAnd I went out to lunch or stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit\nAnd uh I got some change went to the deli order my sandwich was six bucks or something like that I pulled out of five for my wallet and I pulled out a couple of bucks change that I had gotten from a store handed the clerk one of the ones uh and then I looked at it and I I pulled back\nWritten on the dollar and pencil was I asked her and I thought oh that's weird you know I'm thinking about asking her to go study and\nI get those dollars as as trans bizarre\nSo stuck in my pocket you know ... I went to the store I got one of those voting frames and little piece of gold one may and I stopped a dollar and the frame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold as if you know you're going to go on a church in Italy and they had a fragment from the robust some St or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n[laughter]\nHi Joan I can I can I can I knew Ryan wouldn't actually start asking so I started asking because well rains\nLife is short contain many special and unique experiences I Am positive that this is not one of them so if I went to proved him wrong because finding others would be so easy I happened to live in a college town state College Pennsylvania home at Penn State so I drop by frat house has ever\nKnow never in my life was never in my life no never never\nReally so you have you never heard of that happening to anybody\nNot even close never heard of it or not you never ever ever I mean I think it'd be a nice icebreaker would what women\nWant like in a conversation could be like oh it's\nFor anything happened to me yeah I I I always got changed stuck to my back but for weeks\n[noise]\nAnyway lots and lots of knows I asked whole classes as just happen to anyone [noise]\nAnd then we thought Pennsylvania it's too cold rain went to college in Southern California we gotta go south so we are reporters at the University of Virginia have you heard of this happening [noise]\nKnow none of us are this how does that and now\nTo ...

saying no coincidence no story we first aired the show five years ago after asking you to send us your coincidence stories and you flooded us with more than Thirteen hundred pitches we found trends we found gems we found stories impossible to classify\nMy name's Jeff Dunn Jeff Dunn okay Jeff\nGrew up in Sioux City Iowa when he was sixteen he was hanging out with two of his friends at someone's house the parents were at home they're goofing around smoking pot there in the living room that had a huge window on one wall\nAnd so we're sitting there and we're kind of sitting one was class will and there is a dirt road outside of the house and up this dirt road barrels this ban 'em and the thing that happens next is\nWhat you think is going to happen when you see a white man I'm like oh my God you guys get out\nThere out what kind of bundled up [noise]\nPretty quickly just run to the back of an open it up and pull out this big black\nSo they get out they took the tobacco\nAnd they quickly Ron up this kind of small filled spawn\nAll where there's no houses specter so they're wrong with the with the uh [noise]\nLesson like two minutes later come running back down and get moving around and they\nTook off so Japanese friends do precisely what you don't want them to do if this were an after school special this is the point where you're yelling at the TV saying don't do it to stay inside but they decide they have to find out what the strange men in the band have deposited at the top of the hill so they run up there\nWe go to the top and we kind of look around and then we see that kind of on one side of it there's just this manhole cover like a circular manhole cover like you'd see anywhere\nComing from one of the edges of manhole cover ups in places is um\nLong brown hair human hair long\nBrown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out they have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to drive by the flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she them so\nYeah there's been a girl nothing\nOn the west side of town for the last couple of days so my God\nSo we're down or hurts just sort of drop\nAnd you hadn't known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea [laughter]\nSo we we just kind of got scared at that point\nCan I can I say ... is it started getting at funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any don't tell me oh you okay don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple cars\nAnd they're both get out and tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nSo we're waiting they go walking up\nAnd it's dark so we can't really [noise]\nSee them that well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying to alert but of course I'm working\nPulled up pushing them out of the whole\nOh my God and then she says it's a man of ...\nI don't know what my friends have been but I was sitting there thinking own like [noise]\nHow does this story and okay in a universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say it's a male [laughter]\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did it\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover mannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's nativity scene\n[noise] I think the real coincidence is that it's like our close friends that\nCaused this to happen or they were good friends here so [noise]\nRight right no Jeff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story liberties or Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point\nFriends just pointed out that I miss you and I are both MIT [laughter] even though they were going to mess with my own story I submitted it to the current events is going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nHave five words for you to have food shelter ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it's that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because when a Vince line up just so\nYou can't help but you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to a very big questions about fate about God even to people who don't believe in either one\nThe notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan Concord drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that really Daniels Scott me in and I've heard her you know saying that light on that album dozens of times before and wondered who speak any us",
