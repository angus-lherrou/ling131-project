sequence of events with all these different pieces of information that are different museums around the world\nThat you know give us as I said the search completed piece of a puzzle as this is a true story that brand wrote Dracula as a warning to the world and this is brands way of doing it he was a writer and this is his way of of a warning to world you\nSort of tread a line between fact and fiction here right obviously this story is fictionalized but it's based on a real man\nAnd real people how how do you tread that lying convincingly well that was that was\nPart of the fun in it and it was also something that that brand really tried to do when he presented this to his publisher Jack the ripper was running around London so that people have of London were already frightened and I think that was probably a catalyst for changing it you know the approach on this book and if you think about what happened with the war of the world's like that kind of thing later on\nUm I think as publisher actually for saw something like that happening so that's why they stripped out a lot of these things um but a lot of the information that's actually in Dracula is based on true and that um there there's a Russian ship that really ran aground and with the um filled with boxes of earth\nI'm you know I think things like that and Bram ... in his notes he he singled out all these little occurrences and and you know as as like a little wink you know he tried to incorporate as many of them as he possibly could\nOne of the things that I realize especially when I started to get to know branch family is how they influence the actual characters and Dracula brand himself as really you know in my mind anyway Jonathan ... really mean\nArmenians van barrier real person on became vanhelsing it was very much like at the end in the wizard of Oz where these characters in your you realize who they were all along that you can see where brand pulled a lot of this I mean his brother is normally I'm was was a doctor\nAnd we try to incorporate as much as we possibly could cause that's you know were brand was heading in that type of story you want to tell\nI mean we we put an author's note at the end of the book and that's one of my favorite parts in the story where we reveal you know how much of the story you just read in the you know it's a fictional account of feels like a fictional story but you read this author's note and you realize all these people are real all these events actually happened\nAnd that will really sent a chill down his mind\nWhat makes that original story such an injuring classic ... why is it lasted over the years and been adapted so many times what is it about\nThat story well it it's groundbreaking story and that it it did combined as branch says a mystery in fact he touched upon uh amazing premise and that is the whole concept that that people around the world\nOr at sometime in other really was we're concerned about and that's what life after death or is already and that's the concept of immortality\nAnd when Judy and I did a research and we found is Jane started interview the one interview Bram ever gave\nThat we know of a he talked about Thirteen different countries that actually a brand could find at that time and an Eighteen ID that held some kind of a\nPrimary all you know being that that sort of transcended into missing legend of some sort of sold not at rest and and the vampire and would branded combine that with historical person a real a real guy blood Dracula to make it real and so unlike other sort of her stories\nUh it had a very realistic feel to it and that resonated to the readers at the time and of course to the movie makers the guys who were inspired by it so if you go back to many horror stories I mean even Frankenstein is great but it's that's not as realistic as the possibility\nOf from the myth of of the vampire and that's why even today we have many different derivation of vampires are coming back to life to keep us entertained especially around Halloween time\nWould you recommend for for somebody who hasn't read Dracula should they read Dracula first and then dry cool or should they read this prequels first and then the original novel\nI Would read them in order I Would I Would honestly start with ... read the ... um then squeeze in the short story Dracula guest and then dive right into Dracula and and just see how they all fit in together\nYet I I totally agree and if you've got enough of Dracula lifting do pick up my my a sequel directly the undead to
