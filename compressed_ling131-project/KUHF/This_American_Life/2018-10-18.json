debate on TV with us tonight joining the conversation on line using the hash tag Texas debate\nAnd we also have a live audience with us here tonight in the studio to react to please hold your applause ... you're in this debate except for now\nWe walk on the two candidates running for the United states [noise]\nGeneral welcome\nTo night Senator Cruz you one of the coin toss to have the final word tonight at the end of this program so therefore we start with you congressman a warm\nWelcome to you Twenty one days away from the election and they're still uncertainty about security of our ballot boxes and just yesterday new cyber attacks again reported on election databases in several states but misinformation online can be just as dangerous as so many people know\nThe question is should Congress enact regulations on social media to protect voters from that misinformation\nFirst chase let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching us and participating in one most important decisions of our lifetimes ... or ... or ... in in San Antonio\nYes the integrity of our ballot box two hundred and forty two years into this experiment the American democracy but it's the exception not the rule in world history is sacred and it's essential that we continue to protected\nUnder attack unlike any other time in this nation's past we know because the intelligence community has reached a unanimous conclusion on this that the Russian government sought to undermine our democracy in fact\nPresident Trump's own administration announced indictments of pro Russian nationals to compromise the voter data more than half a million of our fellow Americans and we know they will attack us again in this election and the next unless we stand up to them\nCorrect protects us and let me point out all those oil and gas workers they buy homes they buy cars and trucks they get health care that they gave the churches in schools and by the way the University of Texas do next to say and and get hunger is of millions of dollars for my energies that extra\nTime senator let's move on to another response Mr ... and this is what you can expect over the course of this debate\nA Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you he's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or I've ever taken\nHe's dishonest sweaty president called on line to ed and it's why the nickname stuck because it's sort of um look the climate is changing and man made climate change is a fact three hundred years after the enlightenment\nWe shouldn't be able to listen to the scientists and follow their advice and guidance and they tell us that we still have time\nBut the window is closing to get this right if we make our commitment to the generations that follow and not just think about the next election or or political career or pursuit of of the White House than than we can make the right decision that we can support Texas being a proud energy leader in oil\nAnd gas but also in renewable energy today Texas lean to the country we're number one in the nation in the generation of renewable wind power we're number five and Reuben a quick when it comes to solar the two fastest growing jobs the United states of America today\nWind and solar jobs we can continue to grow this economy which will reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy make sure that we produce and refined and transport and use our energy resources more responsibly and listen this is one political party sing assistance\nPeople of both parties in every single county in Texas that we've had the chance to listen to people these are folks who work in the energy industry Amy and I were in Iran Texas listening to those who work in some of these fracking operations what they want\nIs predictability consistency and the regulations and then they will perform to them cards from the time Mr Cruz sixty seven rebuttal washes those ExxonMobil had it wrong here well\nIt it gets clear congressmen Iraq's pollsters have told them to come out on the attack so if he wants to insults may and call me a liar that's fine but you know John Adams famously said facts are stubborn things so if you want to see the votes he cast for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil\nGo to our website it's Ted Cruz dot org and we will put up the exact text of the vote and a link to congressman O'Rourke to vote against the people of Texas let me say if you work\nIn energy if you work in oil and gas\nCongressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking aggressive regulations of exporting liquefied natural gas he's a prominent supporter of President Obama's Paris climate deal which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas\nThat's not good for taxes that it's an example of over and over again congressman O'Rourke sides with liberal extreme is on the national level instead of the people of Texas instead of jobs of Texas and and by the way under the under time\nAre great to Texas leads an energy across the board\nRepresented at this question about immigration policy at Reno your position and passion for the dreamers and we know that your adamantly against extending the existing board I found this question here is specifically about border security if we don't need a border wall\nCan you please look at the lift access tonight and tell them what we do any\nI'd be happy to and and listen I don't know if there's another person who has a greater stake in this issue than I Do I mean are raising Ulysses in Mali and Henry in El Paso Texas a one half of the largest by National Community\nOn the border the defining border community we care about our kids' safety I care about the safety of those that are representing Congress I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas El Paso in fact as one of it's not the safest cities in the United states of America\nBecause we have role class law enforcement police and sheriff's deputies but it's also because we are city of immigrants a quarter of those that I represent were born in our country another country chose us came here to this country and by their very presence made it better know wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns\nBut Congress wards policy will and let me describe a one of those to you Senator John Cornyn\nThough he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat he's in the Senate and I'm In the house\nWorked on policy together to invest in our ports of entry that's where more than Ninety percent of everyone and everything that ever comes into the United states first cross as having a better idea of who and what comes into our country demonstrably makes us safer and at the same time\nThose customs officers are able to facilitate legitimate trade and traveled it's connected to more than a million\nJobs in the state of Texas as we all know here at the home of Toyota trade is the lifeblood of the state of ... if we can make our humidity is more secure as this bill did an facilitate more job growing trade\n'em ... than we really figure something out and I think that John Cornyn I have been able to do Republicans that say about ... other on an issue that makes Texas better time thank you and senator you had Ninety seconds to respond\nSo everyone should notice that his answer that he wanted to talk about trade he wanted to talk about customs you want to talk about everything except border security\nAnd let me say there's no race in the country with a stark are divided on immigration then this race here in the state of Texas that's for me I'm incredibly honored to receive the formal endorsement of the national border patrol council\nThe union of the men and women who risk their lives keeping our nation safe I I Will note here at this debate I'm very pleased we had brand and judge than and Paul Paris both from the national border patrol council\nThe reason they're supporting me as I've led the fight to secure the border building a wall using technology increasing boots on the ground we can keep our community safe congressman O'Rourke\nNot only opposes the wall\nBut he has said we had too many fences and walls already on the border he wants to tear down the ones we have and I know he brought up they'll pass\nEl Paso is right across from war as one of the most dangerous cities in the world three thousand murders last year there was a wall there\nWall is one of the tools you use to protect us but the but let me get an example of just how extreme congressman O'Rourke is on immigration\nCase law common sense legislation overwhelming majority of Texans supported I'm the author of case law in the Senate that says violent criminal illegal aliens that they are deported repeatedly should face a mandatory minimum prison sense\nCongressman O'Rourke has voted against case law\nThat's wrong we need we should not be releasing violent criminals into our community\nCongress men are in your second with ... can you tell us your specific friends I think you either born as\nWell as other just told you a Senator John Cornyn I have worked to invest in our ports of entry that mean staffing\nOf customs all sorts of infrastructure at our bridges that connect us with Mexico where more than Ninety percent of everyone and everything first crosses and it means investment in the technology that ensures that we do a better smarter job screening those who first come into this country that will\nMake us safer it also means that we supported the law enforcement those police officers and sheriff's deputies who kicked this country if we can do that as well but listen or we cannot use this idea of border security\nTo be an impediment to moving forward on those issues that are also demanding or action and which Texans know better than perhaps any other people of any other state\nOn issues of immigration reform of the fate of dreamers nearly two hundred thousand the state of Texas when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for dreamers nine eight senators showed up that day Ninety seven looted voted to move forward only one senator voted no stood in the corner will everyone else was at the table\nTed Cruz has put his career above the interest on my own time Ted Cruz's protect\nPrevent what kind of anti at home on us and\nLet me let me respond to that place which is that I noticed congressman O'Rourke said we need to support the law enforcement I I think that's striking that he says that now in a debate\nBecause his career and has been one consistently opposing law enforcement indeed someone else who is here today is detected my Kelly who leads the San Antonio police officers association elected Eli has endorsed me and I would notice well a hundred and Seventy one elected\nTech say or think cranky very nicely have older I get an ... things directly responsible thanks very much money in Greenland haven't you know how to be the ... marine on your route on his sixty seconds that Sarah bottle if necessary and I want to make a point on law enforcement plains of your way out without\nAll afternoon onto the next topic gentleman was talking about healthcare now what you're looking at for our television audience in the live picture a victory park studios in Dallas where that social media response team is listening to our viewers out there to the overwhelming conversation on line we're hearing about is about health care and wouldn't posed asked few directly congressman O'Rourke\nIf universal healthcare is wouldn't cost trillions of dollars would you cut from the federal budget or how much you're going to raise my taxes to pay for that\nLet's start with the goal what what is it that we're trying to achieve what make sure that everyone\nCan see a doctor for their prescription medications take their child to a therapist being well enough to live to their full potential over the course of their lifetime and I want to make sure that working families pay less for health care costs than they do today so here's some steps that we can take to get to your answer\nUm we can expand Medicaid this is a state that left hundred billion dollars on the table expand Medicaid more working Texans are able to be well enough to go back to work to be there for their families will get introduced Medicare\nAs an option on the exchanges to drive down the increase in premium costs\nThat twelve billion dollars also included hundreds of millions of dollars in support for volunteer fire departments like the one that I visited in Rockport were those twenty volunteer firefighters more than half lost all of their worldly possessions and were sleeping on the floor in in the firehouse as they responded to the emergencies\nIn their community so yes I Will be our work with anyone anytime anywhere to make sure that those Texans who need the help to rebuild\nGet it and we invest in their ability to be resilient\nCounter the next time thanking senator has nine to ... Houston's my hometown\nHurricane Harvey hit Texas unlike any disaster we've ever seen it was devastating I was home with with Heidi in my girls during the hurricane and and and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast two three four five times working with the state and local officials\nI mentioned earlier a hundred and Seventy one sheriff's have endorsed my campaign including\nTen Democrats one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority elected shares of endorse my campaign is because many of those sheriff I've worked with hand in hand after Harvey and the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills\nWorking hand in hand with John Cornyn where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills and the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored I authored introduced passed into law did it jointly with John Cornyn Marco Rubio\nThe cruise Cornyn Rubio emergency tax relief gave over five billion dollars in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey it passed both houses of Congress\nOverwhelmingly was signed into law provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey\nOnly for Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation\nOne of them was congressman O'Rourke congressmen from El Paso and there was a reason for that you know he gave an answer now he said that it didn't provide enough tax relief\nThat's not what he said at the time he voted down at the time he voted now he said the reason he voted now is that he wanted he he wanted to focus on legal immigration and say that again that was his answer at the time\nAnd it hasn't risen thank you send a representative you get you know the second story but on the regret that vote\nI don't I Will always see what I can do work with anyone anytime anywhere to do better for Texas and that that was what I was trying to do but\nYou know Senator Cruz mentioned listening to him working with local leaders in Houston I'm I've listened to and work with the mayor and the county judge a Democrat and Republican each of whom is still waiting\nFor one point one billion dollars awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding but it's still not made its way into the neighborhoods into the streets into the homes into the businesses to rebuild they need a fulltime center not somebody running for president is going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets there\nMay need a fulltime center who would have been at bat for them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified needed funding but they needed a senator who is going to work for them\nArmy Corps of engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because he wasn't in Texas wasn't Houston He was in Iowa\nHe was in New Hampshire he was running for another office instead of taking care of the concerns and the needs of the people were thinking that Senator Cruz a year ago this week October Eighteen twenty Seventeen you tweeted the following statement when it comes to the deficit and debt it is immoral that debt we have and we have to turn it around you wrote\nYour two months later last December as you just mentioned a moment ago you voted for the Republican tax plan that the joint committee on taxation congressional budget office and many other non partisan say led more than a trillion dollars to the deficit some people see the tweet and the vote as hypocritical are they not\nThey are not remotely I'm proud of supported the tax cut the tax cut his producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas in for the country we're seeing record growth we're seeing record low unemployment if its benefit for a million new jobs\nIn the last two years and and by the way one thing that that that Democrats never seem to understand if you want to pay down deficit and debt and I care passionately about the deficit and debt it is in moral the deficit and debt we racked up if you want to do it the only four strong enough to do that\nIs economic growth now let's go back to a little history in the Nineteen sixties John F. Kennedy a Democrat campaigned on tax cuts cutting individual tax cuts and the corporate tax rate is set a rising tide will lift all boats he passed it\nAnd the economy boomed and federal tax revenue went up in the Nineteen eighties Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes to get the economy growing he passed it\nThe economy boomed in federal tax revenues went up we did the same thing this time this time with that tax cut we're seeing the results and today to date federal tax revenues have gone up to the federal tax revenues are higher in it this year than they were last year without the tax\nCuts especially since I was with you in Iowa I've heard you on the campaign trail for since ... twelve saying how bad the deficit and and this vote would add to the deficit the Jason no it wasn't\nThat projection is wrong by the way that projection also would have said that the Kennedy tax cuts would have added to the deficit and the Reagan tax cuts would add to the deficit the reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spur the economy the reason we have a deficit and debt is because\nCongress keep spending out of the term limits it's why we need to pass a balanced budget that we need to stop the Central Valley named on things like social either going to college that are or not he sort of response\nSpeaking of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with\nGood friends in El Paso started a small business\nOr met the payroll every week balanced the books made sure that we delivered for our clients only one of us who served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted with a producer a responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year we did\nAnd for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two trillion dollars\nAnd those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash and the already wealthy in a country that has ribbon with income inequality unseen since the last deal today\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests benefited from this tax cut\nWhy does he vote for this why does it go for Internet companies to fill your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent\nWhy does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt Congress has become I don't take pac money not a gun\nOwners will resent the people of Texas congressman that as your time Senator Cruz sixty suffering\nAbout you know congressman O'Rourke has felt fond of saying he doesn't take pac money but but\nThe truth is different for example the J Street pac which is they rabidly anti Israel pack has raised over a hundred and sixty thousand dollars for congressman O'Rourke because of his many votes against the nation of Israel and other example he has a superPAC based up in Dallas that that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars is bending them on ads\nAttacking me and my family so when he said he doesn't doesn't take pac money just let others do it for him but let me say more fundamental\nThe reason people care about this is they care about who you are fighting for\nConsistently if you look at congressmen Iraq's record every time there is a choice between left wing national activists\nAnd the people of Texas He goes with the left wing national activists and he goes with the left wing national donors for example we were talking earlier about his vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil that is a great vote if you're raising money in San Francisco\nIt's a terrible though if you actually care about jobs in the state\nOf tender time we want to keep this a debate on tractor and let me ask you the next question as soon as ... would\nDo to pull this year with almost Seventy percent of Americans saying civility is a major problem in America and let's talk about the tone of this campaign and what's happening here in the last half hour forty five minutes we we all watched as activists chased union wife Heidi out of the restaurant in DC and then senator some say you couldn't even give a political free complement\nTo your opponent in the first debate in Dallas so the question is what responsibility do you have to bring civility and respect back to the country\nListen Jason I think every one of us has a responsibility to bring stability and respect that's something I've endeavor to do throughout politics is to focus on substance to focus on issues to focus on record and so the personal attacks that go into the gutter that is so common in politics\nI Try not to engage in if you look at my disagreements with congressman O'Rourke they haven't been personal attacks they ban his voting record in Congress that has been markedly out of step with the people of Texas\nYou are right that there there is a loss of civility there is an anger there is a rage on the far left and that is really frightening you know the images ... hold on let me answer with donated right in the game the images of a of a left wing mob beating on the doors of the Supreme Court\nThat's not good for our country we can disagree well treating each other with respect well treating each other\nWith civility I think that's important that we can discuss our tax cuts good or is raising taxes good that that that's a discussion we ought to have but it shouldn't be personally shouldn't go down to the government should focus on actual substance and let me tell you I think the lowest point we have seen as the confirmation hearings for justice capital\nWhere we saw Senate Democrats",
