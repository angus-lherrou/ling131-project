I Know I don't know I Know screen but uh that is really what it is it's a chemical reaction in that introduction\nYou know like if the state of the sunflower seed before matters\nLike whether that risk that are cells that are neither\nThat's a very good quite well here's the thing I Would have thought that roasted would have made a difference you know but apparently it didn't in your case [laughter] no [laughter]\nSo you could use sunflower seeds with the ... yes it's just when\nYou have a comical love 'em yeah because you have baking soda\nSo its alkaline the soda part of it that makes them turn color\nJust changed the name of the bread to green something yeah [laughter] I mean that's what I Dream on file or yeah right no you're repositioning don't apologize never leave certain never ... never explained just presented is that's the way it was supposed to be amazing ... have these bright green muffins why not\nFlick possession my right All right Laura so it's a it's a question of food chemistry yes I think you also thank you Bye bye Bye bye\nWelcome to milk street who's calling uh my name's John Reilly where are you calling from uh near Albany New York how can we help you today\nBowling about lam we have a uh a couple of restaurants nearby that have hello lamb ... that are awesome\nAnd while I like the land that I make it home it's never gotten quite close to what they do and I generally put some kind of olive oil lemon juice Rosemary and something like that on um [noise]\nCubes so they cut typically from a boneless like lamb or a leg bone of tried shoulder as well and they go to great or come out as a ... and I know they marinate them and I'm not sure what they might use\nAnd also I Know that it doesn't have any particular striking flavor it certainly has like a roast Marion or something like that but you wouldn't know recall it flavor to something that just is a taste great\nDo you like the texture or do you find it more tender or ... in an flee\nMore tender I tend to like me that is not as tender you know I'd rather have flavorful than a hundred and my wife tends to like meet that is more tender I think also since its grilled you notice the difference in texture you know of the slate trying on the outside of cetera if the inside is more under\nI Would guess that it may be the age of the animal\nBecause if it's a younger animal it's probably going to be more tender and if it's an older animal shelter that is not going to work 'cause you need to cook that low and slow I can do so you need the equivalent of a ... very expensive I mean we have to be a law in cuts\nFor quick cooking ... you can't use like and you can you shoulder right okay well you like it just would be chillier yeah it's gonna be chewing and he didn't\nWant which is what I've been doing yeah just because it's an easier cut to find and less expensive I just I have another side which is salt ah yeah I mean I've always put some salt but right before your cookie I'm just before I cook it\nWhy don't you try something and it had a dime tossing it with all those other things and then you know padded try aren't just ... it gets a nice here I bet you the salt would make a difference\nOkay yeah well I I Would ask them just asked them about ... what kind of this and the way they get their land was the yeah\nIn the um search for this I did buy like a leg that uh hello butcher sawed off lamb for me but uh that that didn't really help a and that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um you know hard to work around the leg getting\nOff of it so yeah\nLike tricky I mean I the salty for two hours on Iraq is a good idea [laughter] yeah\nYeah yeah All right good shot like thanks yeah but\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you want to know what to do with shrimp heads or rock sales please give us a ring anytime a five five four to six Ninety four three one more time eight five five four to six Ninety four three you can also email us questions at milk street radio dot com\nWelcome to milk street who's gone this is Nicole Hi Nick how can we help you well\nI've spent years failing to recreate that issue that I can India you're not only due to lack of the authentic greedy and\nClearly I'm having issues with the Asian considering they're smaller slightly sweeter and of course anger than North American ... but they don't just color like right on the ends do after long cooking and there are less sweet than the daily as a ...\nShow with onion for ... like a ... or even something that's in the background like a butter chicken\nYou end up with a great career you if you attempt to revenues or accordingly me curry if you go while the ... or something like that\nOr just something to shore up and usually there's just too many onions if you're using standard larger American yellow one\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked\nA ... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different volume of on you and all that\nI Know it's there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about challenge because you know they are sweeter than a yellow onion but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is very different\nI mean if you're big complaint is volume I Would think just a yellow onion and just useless is the simplest thing\nI always think getting the spices right and using whole spices and posting them and doing all the things you should do will make much more difference in weather using yellow or to paint canyon right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to you agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that it you know and the sort of side bar here is also the total lack of availability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced to many of those careers where you've got given that color and everyone tries to approximate it with a kind of the past week ... that's what you\nSomeone broke in and tried to rape you and you actually\nJust propelled yourself out the window a to escape and uh that that must have been a ... this is one of the mid seventies\nYes late seventies it was\nAnd I didn't know that I had that in me and yet when the when that happened I was willing to screaming chump adamant that so\nThat is that a lot about you right\nNow and it kind of empowered me in a way that I didn't expect that and I guess I'm willing to take risk and that's\nThat was very important to me to know that about myself at an early age\nUm could you read for me you quote O'Toole autumn is one of your favorite poems I Believe it's in your book on page rather um maybe you just read the last part of it to swallow the gored I just thought it was a wonderful and just tell us about why you put that in the book [noise]\nI I didn't because it with such a sensual food oriented ... he wrote and I love the season\nOf missed an mellow fruits illness [laughter]\nClose with some friends and maturing son\nConspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit to find the round that such east run\nTo begin with apples that lawsuit cottage cheese and feel all free with right now is to the core\nTo swell the board and ... they have little shelves with a sweet colonel dissent budding war and still more\nLater flowers for the bees until they think warm days we'll never seats for summer has there were ... and they're kind of nice cells\nIs that is that Keats who who wrote that teach yeah um let's talk about food your favorite recipe is meant she I think actually what I saw your life you've made me ... but so explain that please\n[laughter] ah it's my favorite recipe because it only has two ingredients meant and water\nBoiling water and I I just love recipe legs [laughter] but he he was surprised that that's all it is but if you have the best tomato a little salt to love ... that's in\nYour book really the theme that comes through for me is that your restaurant and your your career and your life going back to your mother\nYou said I was running a counter culture restaurant and it was so long really\nAnd and so ... you're always fighting against the culture or parts of the culture you currently would describe as fast food or as you said we're leaving our land behind we're forgetting about our children\nSo you your restaurant is really a an expression\nOf your view of the world today\nI think you have said it well indeed it is I Hope it is and I hope sent people to come to feel that\nWhen they're that they\nFeel the hospitality the openness of the restaurant the determination that we have around to have we purchase their foods\nWe put the names of the farmers on the menu we've done that for years and years and years and people come and say are you know ... ...\nYou know and it's it it helps to make connections for people that then the taste comes from the people who take care of the land Mm\nAlice thank you so much for your time Mm\n...\nThat was Alice Waters her memoir is called coming to my senses the making of a counter culture coffee when I first met Allison shape and he's back in the Nineteen eighties she was sitting at a table shelling peas and she didn't look like the typical run chef\nTwo decades later I returned to shape for dinner\nAnd it was really struck by the food the essence of each ingredient was preserved and course natural presented\nBy the fact that Alice had persevere she shown up if you will with so many other food celebrities that going on to other restaurants in other careers that got me thinking about the good life perhaps it's simple enough\nTo find out what you like to do and just keep doing it for you might say it's really the mileage that matters as long as you keep driving straight line\n\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen of milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipe Fawcett confide show with\nJay Mario I'm doing great it's cost them being day here and no straight it is about ... or has a lot of people say ... [laughter] but look this recipes and hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't know here\n[laughter] yeah you know it is such a simple dish and\nI guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and our max that they bring to the table\nAnd it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's Sicily\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was really teach me basic rustic facility and cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is frozen bloody beings into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook them away and when the beans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a ... good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and creamy nurse and yet there was no dairy and\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions all been through\nI think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here the beings are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married and this kind of like ... starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd so the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple\nGroup of ingredients it just has an amazing impact and flight so I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations so that we did we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for weeknight ease we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we weren't like moved up a bit and I'd even the dishes second time ... and that turned the woman making it added some tomatoes which we liked so we borrowed that kind of bring a little bit of a city to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right there and it also really played well with the Russians are\nSupposed to call social and like I say I'm you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult no it's very simple jammed thank you thank you you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one southern southern milk streak dot com\nOn Chris Kimball you're listening to milk street radio coming up to and passion forms an on air experiment demonstrating how sound effects case we'll be right back and\nSupport for Christopher Columbus milk street comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery proudly supports milk street and ... everywhere bath kitchen and lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\nChristopher ... is ... by cp came media publisher of Tuesday nights and new cookbook with over two hundred quick recipes from all over the world milk street changed the way you cook visit us at one seven seven milk street dot com\nSupport comes from the museum of fine arts Houston presenting contesting the during the day in formulas and in Venezuela Nineteen fifty five in Nineteen Seventy five with historic works by modern Venezuelan artists opens today more at an F.
