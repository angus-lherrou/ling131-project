I Can't get if you turn up the way it does in the restaurant\nYou know when it's really good it missing something all of the recipes that I researched online are very similar it's missing something and I don't know what I feel like there's a secret\nHow are you cooking the egg plant\nI cut the plants and a half brush with a little bit of oil and then I put them on a bake stone like a cookie sheet type of baking stone in the oven for about a twenty thirty minutes high heat are nice and soft high heat yes\nSome of my editors have when they were in the middle east watch people cook eggplant and cook it right over a flame open ... open flame you could do it on a real or you can do it on your burger but they get the outside bark charred mhm ... you're\nProbably missing the Smokey taste I bet\nYes yeah it is it that's it do you have a grill and open flame ET do\nThere is a wonderful recipe from my friend Elizabeth Carmel she's grilling expert she used to work for ... years ago she taught a lot of those guys who became famous everything they know about grilling\nShe has a book all about grilling I think it's the art of grilling I always loved her eggplant she takes a whole eggplant and she's done sit with garlic clubs and\nThen she grilled set and then she led to finish off heat so it picks up even more\nSmoke it's a wonderful wonderful recipe I have to cook it\nSo long pat ... yes how hall and it's it should really look like somebody pulled the plug out of a balloon right yeah within just laid it had to ... and charred but what's cool about her it's just it's got the garlic in it so bizarre looks cooking too because you always had garlic\nI think Chris is right you just need to chart in some way either on a direct flame or you know under the broiler and you need to cook it till it's completely\nCalculated yeah long pet auditor yachts and then also the to Haiti if you went to Haiti to make sure you get a good brand on\nSome of the you know a mention names

went on to reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal also employing a smart literary style of writing\nToday shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist of the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full pod cast\nMe how are you I'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone knows but ah in December Seventy five you became to food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the New York times is that\nCorrect or not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan Lippmann who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire me her name was Charlotte Curtis the woman who did harm me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper a Rosenthal\nI don't like vinegar because it's so I said how can I vinegar in a dish I said try lemon juice or some of the sweeter vinegars like apple cider vinegar or Sherry vinegar\nI agree I I found to other things about people call in with questions one is\nA ... cooking\nIs so social it's almost that old with a Cosmo column Kansas marriage be safe you know I mean that people say my husband like this I like that who's right [laughter] it's very those are the tough one nobody's writing you're both right God but\nThere's some pretty serious comes out there and I think for me it just feels to me like they're more more people doing more serious cooking and when I got started in this back in the seventies maybe\nI had the impression that people sit watching the food network and your program while they send out for food [laughter] so they have time to watch a program that's\nThe [laughter] and they watch my showing get takeout\nThanks for yeah [laughter]\nWas last question going back in time is there a moment that uh\nThat really sticks view because it was one of those things could never happen twice\nWell one of my most outstanding reviews that has followed me all over the years is the one I did on radios\nThe Italian Restaurant up and Spanish Harlem little dive where they tables and what happened to it after I reviewed it so that was one kind of very lasting thing\nWell we'll wait a minute let me stop you so what what was the review and what happened\nWell ... says this little two steps down from the sidewalk longtime\nRed sauce Italian Restaurant but very well done in Spanish Harlem\nAnd a local politician who was a friend of ours knew them and said we should go there and he wouldn't tell them who I Am and we went and and I was just blown away by the lemon chicken and the seafood salad and the pastas\nAnd I went back a few times after that myself we one has foul county which was my married name [noise]\nAnd I gave it three stars\nAnd everybody went crazy including the restaurant they were furious they took the phone off the hook they close this came out in July they closed for the month of August thinking it would blow over\nAnd of course it didn't blow over and it grew and grew and so now they have a restaurant and Hollywood and they have a restaurant in Las Vegas and they have a whole line of prepared sauces\nAnd um and one of my birthday parties then owner Frank Pellegrino came and talked about how surprised they were because he said we didn't know anything about restaurant reviews we read the daily news and read the New York [laughter]\nAnd it changed their lives so I was somewhat non plus because it was really a simple um unprepared assessing place except for the law or a\nCouple of weeks after it came out I had a call from a lieutenant in the New York police force who told me it was a gathering place for the mafia and I'm In many many years later I was introduced to Norman Mailer and the first thing he says oh the woman who ruin regular size\n... right [noise] yeah yeah [laughter]\nSo you know it had a coterie of writers and and kind of in people and recognizing that I'm loving it and then finding out that the whole world was going to love it too\nWhich is also true of all I'm a little way in which was also true of the palm um it was very gratifying for me to feel that what I liked many many people like I didn't need it for justification but at least I felt I was on the right track as a critic\nWell ... Norman Mailer had one other person to be upset with with long list [laughter] yes\nAnd I admired him that I admired him though he was a great ride\nMe thank you so much it's been an honor and it's also been a great pleasure thank you\nFor me to thank you very much Chris\nWas restaurant critic of journalists Mimi Sharon and Sharon is a columnist at the Daily Beast and she's also co hosting special episodes of his ... game passionate series is entitled and asking for meaning\nYou're speaking to share the reminded me how much I just like the term food writing the term that implies a lesser degree of art along with terms like travel writing in sports rain\nWell it's actually pretty simple X ray riding is good writing and there's bad writing no matter what\nMany shares and reminds us that even in the age of social media good writing manners and so I leave you with her description of a French dish and title truffles under the ashes quote\nI was surprised to be thoroughly said by the stunning licorice over\nThe butter from interior as well as with a strong aroma and flavor of autumn leaves cold woodland air mystery birthing is an incredible balance of bitter sweet and salty\n\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipe Tuscan beef peppers to\nSplit how are you angry because there's a recipe or you know the recipe it's a Tuscan beef and pepper stew it's beef lots of beef obviously pepper ground pepper and why do you know the whatever just throwing the pod cook it will slow come back a few hours later it's done\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor Willis and the wind isn't rich and ... it's kind of just acidic and kind of nasty actually\nSo I I don't know how they used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation and in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks in these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic\nAnd no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace this late comes from the meat itself there's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavors so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not such paying them be before you put it in just you know the ... a little bit then put the median but you're not doing anything else to leave before because\nWe're not we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of such hang me without actually having to do the work which you know we live around here\nSo instead of cooking the whole time covered we take the cut her off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning on the meat there that you would have gotten if they ... at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the one so that was not in\nThe winds waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning it really diluted not only the flavor of the ... the kind of made me taste a little weird as well so we waited until the very end to add\nThat so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strange ... chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich soccer so\nThis recipe the Tuscan recent peppers to almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the beat in three hours on the up and take it out reduced to monitor that any you're done\nIt's amazing and it tastes great taste so good when thank you You're welcome\nEven get this recipe for ... and ... do have one seven seven no street dot com\n\nOn ... and you're listening to milk street radio coming up next Steve amused considered a new way to think about pairing wine and we'll be right back\nSupport
