swam or took rats across Emily Green reports after shrinking yesterday the care of them has grown in size\nThat thousands and thousands of people in this caravan a good number did come from Honduras over the past week\nLarge down her already living here and how and how does that and then joined the cabin and hopes and making it to the United states [noise]\nThe mood is play if they were just chanting were not mental health workers\nLetting the caravan pass through clearly\nSeveral Mexicans are lining the road handing out water to the migrants says they walk in the sweltering heat\nA landmark Cold War nuclear arms treaty between the U.S and Russia is on the brink of collapse NPRs Amy held reports Trump says the U.S will withdraw from the Nineteen eighty seven agreement that bans short and intermediate range nuclear missiles\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces or ins treaty says quote nuclear war would have devastating consequences for all mankind it was considered a critical step into fusing Cold War tensions when president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed it in Nineteen eighty seven\nNow three decades later President Trump says the U.S is pulling out Russia\nViolated the room and they've been violating it for many years\nTrump pads now the U.S will have to develop those weapons unless China which has been producing its own arsenal and checked and Russia agreed to halt their programs Russia's deputy foreign affairs minister says a U.S withdrawal would lead to retaliation Amy held NPR News\nPresident Trump says he's not satisfied with Saudi Arabia's explanation of how journalists Jamal quiz show J died earlier he called the kingdom's account of a fist fight that turned deadly credible meanwhile NPR's nor was was reports Saudi Arabia's foreign minister tells Fox News his country's investigation continues\nOf a of a a Marco Polo story\nThat he introduced pastas Italy was completely completely absurd their spouse in Italy long before Markopolos probably introduced by Arabs\nWell you you do these books and you are dealing with history all the time and and that's a question I have for you when you started researching how do you get at the truth\nOh my God that that I mean that is the the question of journalism is how do you get the truth and how do you know which version is true and sometimes you just have to give all the versions well yeah but\nIf you're talking about the Nixon administration for example is a little different than if you're talking about something that happened five hundred years ago ... year\nYeah but you never know Nixon might have slipped out a truce when no one was looking [laughter]\nUh someone touched that mark and a great pleasure making another great book yeah nice talking to you\n[noise] that was more of a new book is called milk ten thousand year food Frank\nYou can subscribe to listen to mostly radio anytime as podcasts released new shows every Friday an apple pie ... tune in decided to take a few recalls and my co host Sarah militants areas of course the star of service we done meals on public television also author of home cooking one on one\nSarah how\nAre you Chris I'm good I I think it's time to take some calls what do you think open up the lines let's go welcome to milk street who's calling\nHi my name is Jackie I'm calling from Kalamazoo, Michigan\nI think this is our first Kalamazoo car yes how nice how are you know how can we help you today\nSo my question about different except for our I've been watching a show that in Europe that I imagine many listeners accidentally or with [noise]\nAnd the contest as often talk about ingredients like strong white bread flower strong planes flour and then playing flower which I assume it's like all purpose flower but what do you mean and how do we translate that to an American grocery store and looking at wheat flour all purpose flower or even self ...\nFirst of all the Brits sale you many um [laughter] I mean you\nDon't have to deal with well I you know is that if we don't speak the same language is what I'm trying to say good faith or we speak American they speak\nEnglish well I assume that a strong flower a strong bread flower means a high gluten flower strong would I think relate to the gluten content so a plane flower would be all purpose flour\nI actually think a plane flowery has no rising stuff in it so it's so it's not self rising not self rice and they called fail racing or something crazy like very good yeah so plane that's without that extra stuff\nBut a strong bread flower would be higher looting I think we can agree on that again I don't know you know percentage wise how they stack up next to each other\nWell in this country gold medal for example is ten till eleven percent Clinton but I Believe the king Arthur is closer to twelve percent so Oh hi gluten\nAll purpose flower in this country you go to king Arthur yeah a bread flower is going to be running Thirteen fourteen percent clue and so\nI think a strong flower ... strong white flour I Would use king Arthur all purpose and a strong right flower would just be a bright flour so let's ask you a question on the show\nWhen did they specifically referred to one of these strong flowers\nA master class\nThey'll talk about how to make different types of bread for example and they'll actually walking through the steps so I'm thinking about the episode about\nThey were talking to all the steps and and now I don't remember which one it was but I Want to say it with strong white flour that they reference and I like what is that and how do I find that\nWell ... you wouldn't want a strong flour and she bought it has a lot of holes in it and that is because of the high hydration that has a high percentage of water but also high gluten flower will help with that so I was just like a strong bread flower simply means bread fly gluten bread flower yeah so why do you love the show\nIt's really fun I you know I don't really care for reality shows accept everyone is so it's not particularly dramatic and I learn anything and then I come up with questions like what John White bread\nAnd they've got a British accent which makes it all the nicer now ever on so cute [laughter] Psaki thank you very much yeah\nThat helps thank you for taking my call okay take care welcome to melt street has gone\nThis is the address from Naples, Florida how can we help you um I think a lot and one of the things that I was interested in doing that I think\nBut I also have chicken and so I don't buy my eggs I just take my chickens gives me\nAnd it says to only eggs that had been pasteurized and I don't know how to go about doing that with my own eggs or necessary or what [laughter]\nHere they get two very different answers you're probably for the ball I also get my eggs from a someone who actually works on the show who keeps chickens the only problem with that is really have to make sure they're clean properly mhm I don't know what the like when you get your own but make sure they're really well cleaned on the outside 'cause that's where the contamination is going to come from\nOkay secondly I don't personally worry about raw eggs but if the or your own chickens if you clean the well I Would think you are okay but it is a risk pasteurized something I have to get them up to the temperature for one sixty\nBut okay I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't either\nA supermarket eggs are very well clean there's a film on the outside of an egg when you harvest it yeah it definitely feels different right and it protects the eggs from air getting in to the egg\nBut the supermarket eggs are that's rinsed off and then they read or oil them or they put something on the outside to protect the egg but they're very very well clean\nChristmas right as the outside of the fact that we really need to make sure gets cleaned\nYou know it's one of those things you know you you want to say the over eighty the under five and the immune impaired perhaps should not have the zags\nUnless they're taken to at least one sixty but I think I did and that\nYou know you're fine you know just don't leave them out forever and the good thing about your legs it's they're really fresh which means do beat up beautifully\nBecause they are so fresh thank you so much I appreciate it take care thank you Beatrice I\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a ... question please give us a call at eight five five four to six nine aid for three that's eight five five four to six Ninety four three or send us an email questions and milk street radio\nDot com [noise] Hi this is Terri Hi how are you I'm fine how can we help you [noise] well\nI remember hearing on your show I as I can throw rent paid for eight grade\nOr something to put on fake when you're really get into ... and I looked them to try and find something like that and wondering if they can get me some idea\nOf wave upon the granite and Iraq and very simple recipe for chicken or steak or eight and vegetables or anything like that\nYeah you can um it's available on almost any supermarket now my moon a which is the brain we sell we think is the best but how do you spell that M y M O U and posture fee\nAnd that's great but for grill you're probably doesn't matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight up straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn\nThe other thing I Do with pomegranate ... a small amount to vinegar correct her dressing it's as you know sweet and sour and I just had tremendous steps to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little at a stew just to add a little bit of deaths sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together any beef stew parks do lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of Palmer ... just to add a little depth to it and nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavor\nIf you're adding a little bit of sweet and sour yeah\nI find is probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind or he goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would take lazy and vinegar credits and adding to students are three things I Do Sarah\nI have all of that sounds good to me I mean for people who don't know what pomegranate molasses is like it's a little bit like ... what I might do for a glazes combine it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and then just put it on in the end you know maybe a little bit of garlic\nNow you're French or fight it but I Do [laughter] All right Terry thanks very early on you have a ...\n\nAnd listening to the radio I'm Chris Kimball coming up next my interview with running Monday ... author of noodles and Appalachian Journey with recipes we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] support for Christopher Campbell's milk street comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery proudly supports milk street and calling their crusaders everywhere bath kitchen and lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\nDo she's your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty seven\nSo I assume the apples in the south obviously the north the temperatures\nThat they're designed a to be grown in sort of a different climate\nYeah the history the apples here um\nJefferson sent many many many many apples and she Appalachian because unlike the the deeper south it has a wonderful spraying it has a good ripening summer and then it has a cold snap\nThat is what really brings out the flavor and apples and Apple's kind of do the same thing that that the beans do which is that they will adapt to their surroundings and and\nAnd mutate and create all these different apples and so there are apple hunters they're called in the Appalachian region who have interviewed people in ... and descriptions and tasted apples when they could et cetera et cetera\nAnd so it's thought that there were well over a thousand varieties that were grown in Appalachia initially\nUm to make cider but then um the apples became a food stuff in it and it became a thing that you took pride in a year apple had a distinct flavor and it has an impact on\nThe food the apple stack cake which has made road dried apples they're really a traditional way to do it is not to put spices into it and the reason why is because you're apple had a distinctive flavor and that we've come through\nYou know I talk about my mother being able to teach my sister and me just by looking which green beans to load up on at the family reunion because she knew who grew and cook the best ones and you could tell by site\nAnd so you could tell by taste at one time somebody is apple stacked cake because you knew their apple\nSo let me just mentioned a few recipes shore up pickled baloney with pepper [laughter] come on now tell me about that one\nOh wow well that's a I met a woman was doing that Wendy Johnson and and I kind of took off with the fundamental recipe that she had and and you made it a more elaborate and it echoes those big jars of pickle baloney that we're just such a treat and\nA signal fire in the mountains of good times you know if you could afford\nTo have the the grocery shop off a piece of pickle baloney you were doing well\nAnd so we came up with this homemade version of it and Chris that has been for the last year and a half I've been traveling around talking\nAnd doing dinners you know how folks will doing dinner advanced on your book and that recipe is the single most popular one with contemporary chefs uh they love it they love it and the audience loves a scrape off\nAt a sweet potato soccer now I I've research is the one time or another lots of origin or maybe we're half of that term could you describe what it is and what it means\nMore so than North Carolina the diversion of soccer is that this is based on which is the one made around mount airy North Carolina is actually a cobbler and that is larger than the normal cobbler and and it has a gel on the bottom end to do on the top\nAnd then it has what's called milk dip which is a warm milk sugar concoction that when you take the song her out of the oven you pour that over the top and it seeps into it\nI I expect that foodie haven't someday there will be an entire room that is just devoted to people loudly arguing about what's the difference between a cobbler in a stronger and abetting a crisp and you know all the all the terms\nOf things that you can get three people to Rome and get five opinions right exactly [laughter] so what's happening to apple watching now is it is it a million different stories is it going back to find Its Food ways the roots obviously you're involved with the\nUh and it's going to keep some of the past stores like most of the rest of America we just keep moving into the future\nUm well\nI I Will say more than ... you know there are other regions there other cultures that value their past because of our story telling history which I was going to cite is another reason why we name or beans because then we can tell you\nStory about it and there's nothing we not better than a story unless it's eating and they're both kind of in the same room so Appalachians are young Appalachians are very keen to embrace their history and\nA couple of things have changed in the economic landscape there is the absence of coal\nWhich is of course being argued about now that are at the time that I wrote the book was perceived as a done deal\nAnd in the wake of that community aren't looking to establish smaller economies that are insured laced with one another and therefore sustainable some food becomes a piece of that you know food becomes\nA piece of something that can be produced to be sold elsewhere but can also feed you and your family\nIt becomes a gathering place for people in the community food is a way to to create a truism economy and farming can become a wage to continue to stay on the land and continue that tradition\nWe aren't as we have always been in an interesting moment in Appalachia hum and I I just feel incredibly fortunate to get to ride around at my ... and write about it it's pretty fun\nRonnie thank you so much a fascinating book and uh it's just nice when someone takes the time in the years and the hours to really to really do the research and uh find out what's actually going on Ronnie thank you so much and crafts\nThat was Ronnie ... her book is called Middleton Appalachian Journey with recipes\nYou know growing up in Vermont the locals had a keen sense of place one family name their street tutor road in the next week neighbors across the way put up a sign Skidmore full force\nEvery hill and valley was named for reason minister hills swearing hills south east quarters wrote in bear mountain\nAppalachian takes its name seriously to\nLogan giant greasy cut short or the names of Appalachian beans\nToday things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia name so real stories about real people in a room\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJ. Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is and and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well came to base is better than ours but you went to Italy you have to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is\nAnd you know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise]\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients are way off in general are garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough Faisal they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist without and\nWe use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produced a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to fit it beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add the ingredients are either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the baseball for example into soon you're going to over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pass to that's pretty dry is thought a green sauce\nRight it's dry exactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but really if it's a loose then you add it to like olive oil and ... ... ... I feel it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta coconut water then it's considered pets or not it's considered a complete but that's why I say we add way too much olive oil are we supposed to be dinner at an earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients I'll get the orders very important again because you don't want to order process the ingredients you start out with the garlic the pine nuts salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find ... usually distributed through the faster\nThan we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in again you add those to the high end up in the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the trees\nNow the ... the wealthiest we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... like they do in Italy reason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just pulse of the few times and it's done\nOur case most of the day is what we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right to system the without over processing it and try to get into our watery puree but\nThe solution is pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what we use food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell it lacks the romance of bashing it with a mortar in Pashto but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious so\nJim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker", "show_name": "Talk of the Nation (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
