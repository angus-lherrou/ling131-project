Q. ginger greater which I Love it's the little plastic thing cost Fifteen or twenty bucks a integrates ginger very quickly what is it looked like Chris ... green plastic it's like an oval shape looks maybe five or six inches wide\nAnd has a little drawer the pulls out oh really you capture all the Jews and the great uh ginger\nAnd that's really great what's it called it's called kitchen I. Q. ginger great okay now works great onions I think when you Joyce or chop onions there's so little liquid being given off persist the volume of onions I don't think that's the guy talking about some recipe said a great at oh integrated sure you can gray right over\nThe bowl or right over the pan or wherever it's going I Would use it to him he'll clue that liquid as long as you're not going to be watering down whatever you're doing like addressing but\nIf your heating it cooking skill it's yes it will be fine absolutely I'm not sure that well last year no onion juice would have a lot of flavor we've actually use that for a cure for salmon and fish sometimes when Jews\nI could see it in the ... I Would think it'd be fun there's tastes and a lot of cuisines where you make a paste it's a wet paste and then you go ahead and saute it anyway David yeah\nI mean by the way I said with a orange or women are ... just\nDon't do that over the cutting board cause the essential oils end up on the cutting board and that's where a lot of the flavors so makes her you know just right over the bowl where we are greedy and they're going to go use a micro point test or whatever do the right over the bowl and you won't lose those essential oils okay\nAwesome that sounds great yeah usually use of micro play and therefore ginger and that just kind of make the pope\nBe no no that doesn't work now so definitely have to look into that\nYeah that's that's definitely the better way to do it okay great there you go thank you for going All right thanks ... thank you so much by welcome to mistreat who's calling this is calling airport in New York how can we help you\nWith that question about ... and ... high ... high and then getting the pipes accept that her ...\nYear I've had to run for crying out a record haven't quite gotten temperature I don't think right and the timing right I've had it for to see that and turning it one solid now\nWell I only have about fifty questions [laughter] yeah I don't really like the most difficult thing it's baking blood sugar plus eggs plus dairy so what are we talking about just a basic custard pie or a particular kind\nThis is a cranberry chest high orange fast and there's two cups of chopped cranberries and apply um and then they got eggs and butter milk and butter\nIt just has set properly\nI Would say that three quarters of the top of the pilots solid and then you had that really luxurious silky custard at the bottom for like a quarter inch second on it it it was like for one minute to the next in line from ... to come\nWait wait fat and over ...\nLet me ask a question did you take the ... when the center was still juggling\nNo instructions says that's higher than when the top is slightly half and it had turned like gold and brown\nKnow what you need to do with any custard pie I think might help is the center\n... or so you should still juggle because there's a lot of retain heat and carry over cooking once it comes out of the oven if you want the perfect temperature when cooled\nThe center has to be under cooked and it will finish cooking outside of the oven if you wait to accustom ... totally set this often happens with a cheesecake I was gonna say cheesecake it happens it happens with ... other things you really have to under bake the center ... okay and then just tickles side with a holding onto an oven Mitt and then\nOver the next Fifteen or twenty minutes we'll set up properly but that will help the other thing you have to check his course Robin temperature but you know\nYou waited till I was fully ... which means it will be overcooked by the time it comes out Sarah ah no I agree I agree I think Chris you're probably right quick question how many eggs and how much buttermilk how much sugar\nThree large eggs in one cup of that or not I didn't decrease the sugar a little bit I took that reason I ... corridor and you know a little bit less than a cop I talked to slavery was great but I'm also wondering how much this airplanes\nDid this is how ... what happens on a call in show like this everything's fine until about five minutes the ball and tell me what happened I cooked it over my barbecue and ... are actually out in the Senate if at a number\nWell you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect on something like a custard pie\nBecause of the chemistry so go back and use the original amount and take it out when it goes in the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out an especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's a very delicate chemistry\nAll right well I Will certainly try that said thank you so much for your incite yeah we'll see what happens now ... thank you but I\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a cooking failure a complaint or if you just want to try to stump us give us a call that number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eight five five four to six Ninety four three or email us that questions and milk street radio dot com\nWelcome to milk straight who's calling\nMy name is Ryan I live and Logan, Ohio Hi Ryan when does your question today\nWell my question is about loss and next to ... a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was a fun so we were trying to make off at home and we did not have I guess the\nEgg laying Lyme so we're trying to use what ashes and we weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if\nYou guys [noise] an answers\nI go to Amazon and get the right stuff you get it to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of word is I mean what do they do within that yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn you're growing for this right it's a failed clients are the kinds of field corn I mean it is to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety\nI Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the kernel of like a little bit more like popcorn but\nIt's marketed as a Flint corn like something you know what ... or ... or we've made cornbread with it things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult like Moscow at the the colonel's we're a little bit smaller point at about ... on it\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] I mean you look at let me just to understand as you're doing this because it's an either perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right\nRight yeah I think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you made it at home fresh\nCompared to like using Martha her you know like the stuff he at the store that's dried\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boy was held by mixture pouring off getting rid of the ... boil it for four hours I think we just cement that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made\nHere's a thought there's some wonderful are cheese no companies that make ... and ... finance and mills isn't it ... I wouldn't be surprised if you called the ... and asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you\nAnd then a couple of good call one of the companies and just order the mosques\nAnd I think this is how I Do want to do one that would be my best suggestion even though both of us were hippies back in the day we we weren't trying to their own Brian thank you so much yeah great question and I'll give an says oh you can find the answer\nThese new sites that are happening because of the innovation that's happening right now but every moment in history there's been some sort of innovation and people have been grappling with this since the fifties and before\nSo this is a fight we're just going to continue to have a good science money's the definition between what is meeting what our eggs and that was something nobody had to fight about fifty years ago right there was no choice right\nRight yeah so we keep coming up with new ways and it's a balancing sort of innovation with precaution\nSo in the peanut butter wars roof Guzman and the federation of homemakers wanted the FDA to set of standards of peanut butter contains Ninety five percent peanuts in the end the standard was set a Ninety percent right let's play a short clip from the end of your series were Ruth's call for caution regarding food additives resonates in a very real way\nIn the last few years skippy and just have phased out partially hydrogenated oil because as Kevin Myers of skippy explained to me\nPartially hydrogenated oil has some level of\nTrans fat trans fats are are implicated in artery potential artery clogging\nArtery clogging that's linked to heart disease\nSo George him away from the virtually hydrogenated eliminating the trench that possibility and the product was very important\nI ask Kevin if he thinks in retrospect maybe the higher standard that roost as men than the FDA had originally called for the Ninety five percent peanuts would have been better so that the amount of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats would have been limited and peanut butter long ago\nI think having a twenty twenty hindsight of what has happened over the years the limiting those to at least a lower level probably would have been a good approach to the point in time you know\nOf course with Desmond point was let's not wait for twenty twenty hindsight let's err on the side of precaution to begin with\nSo as the FDA's approach to this changed since then you think or they're doing this to the same dance between the lobbyists when the FDA\nI think the dance continues and consumers have gotten a lot more\nVocal I think Ruth Desmond what was what was so cool about the peanut butter grandma is uh that she was ... one of the first examples of really I just sort of a an everyday consumer she wasn't a lawyer she wasn't someone who was was trained to do this but who\nStarted to pay attention and do her research and get really engaged in this process and wanted to carve out a space for the everyday consumer his voice here's ... daughter Janet again\nThe others would sit quietly they didn't talk mother did all the talking but they would sit there and agree with everything and and look very elegant and grandmother lay\nAnd when the industry lawyers said something particularly in regime to the homemakers ladies would give them the luck leads\nTo cut the Harry eyeball I'm at ... at proper intervals yes and what happened to\nRuth does the peanut butter grandma did she go on and ah continue this life of consumer action\nShe went on to talk about different additives in baby food and ah various hormones that were put in and meet ... she was a lifelong consumer advocate and she died in her eighties and I think she was fighting up until the end of\nThe thank you so much a that's a well it is not an unusual story but it's a good reminder that some things never change they can so much of course\nThat was Krissy Clark in your wealth and poverty correspondent marketplace or series on the peanut butter wars was originally produced for the uncertain our a podcast she hopes for markets\n\n[noise] ... you know there's nothing new about adults rated ... sulfate pickles for bright green color to using bar acts as a preservative food manufacturers have long adultery to foods to increase profits\nAre there is a twist ... for example wants the FDA due to find an egg as an egg now does some processed version of the so finally the food at a restaurant industry you see the profit motive in selling pure natural foods so it's a bit early to declare victory\nBut at least one restaurant chain is acting like a good topic\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen most recent chat with when Clark about this week's recipes [laughter] when I'm great Chris not too long ago we had a couple on our radio show me ruined village or they have a restaurant in Vancouver called the Jews they've had it for many years and we enjoy the interview so much we actually went there\nTo cook with them and one of the things we lovers or yellow split pea curry we brought the recipe back here and are you did some work with\nTo this is a great week night mail it takes only about an hour a lot of that is hands off times not allowed to ... to it has two components we're going to simmer some yellow split peas in water with ... salt and ... and then the other part is the base of the curry which is the muscle\nAnd muscle is just a bunch of spices essentially\nThat's right so in this case we start with onions are near uh really stressed the importance of the onions here and we cook them for about Fifteen minutes until their golden brown so that really adds a lot of sweetness to the dish and we use a combination of fresh\nWhole spaces and ground spaces here so fresh cilantro stands and ginger whole cumin coriander and yellow mustard seeds and then ... and that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds till you can kind of smell those spices\nYou know I Love about this is that here in America vegetables like games are kind of bland they were like the centerpiece all you have to do is looking to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating steak I mean has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of NATO at the end I\nAdd those yellow split keys to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and vicious restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal that really this is so flavorful and feeling that you don't really need\nThe fight is going to go on everything about five years so you always will be Korea so many courses for Tuesday and I think when You're welcome crafts and\nUm\n... you're listening to milk street radio is coming up more of your color and questions with Michael
