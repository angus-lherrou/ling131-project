particularly in developing countries so that makes it difficult for them to access health education and finding something the world bank considered at an event recently looking at possible technical solutions\nCan banks the head of social impact of a digital identity from your study was that our dream recruit right here put it to him the digital IDs hadn't been fully embrace in developed countries so why should they do presser elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point ... about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being bullied by the fifth birthday so it's about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSo is this the kind of way as we've seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing places of leapfrogging existing ways of doing things and getting straight to digital tentative\nIt is absolutely a pipe is still quite important to many of these places but if you're going to end such that governments of West African countries all across the Asian countries that have been trying to help them to register\nChildren being bowl which is the best starting point of it registered as being bored and then they tend to have an identity going forward so that's the that's the point that people are focusing on quite a lot but absolutely if you can go in at that stage and give them a digital identity rather than giving them ... then um they settle for life as a type politician the growing digital economy\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide these ditched license

average creepy in and they can be life threatening\nDid you like an ... an ID causing general often feel people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you set up camp today's concerns\nRight well there are a number of different solutions and and uh ideas kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently at a well bank event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at blow chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions\nI'm centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on\nBut at the same time that our favorite ... is an odd how recently got hacked or again reactor number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm some ideas about using cell phones are not entities way you have your identity on your mobile phone only you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with a service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by you rather than
