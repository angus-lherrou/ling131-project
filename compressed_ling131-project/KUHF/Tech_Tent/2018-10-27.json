mainstream Tesla stuff all the investors and the good wife uh once by announcing that it actually made a profit yes a profit in the mail three months that was thanks to exist says in ramping up production of the modern free uh supposedly affordable electric car\nMeanwhile ... unveiled a plan to this right or if it's forty thousand drivers in London to go electric by twenty twenty five would help to buy an electric vehicle funded by a so called clean as levy on passengers\nThey're expecting half of them twenty thousand to make the switch by twenty Twenty one\nNow that sounds ambitions especially given the need for someone to charge or those new electric vehicles who was northern European chief Jamie hey would told me that was certainly a challenge\nThe moment or in the u._k. we have only twin two thousand charging points across the u._k. we compare that with other countries such as new way on evidence they will have a head of population ten times the number of\nCharging points so that's a huge challenge at the moment the majority of people who have electric vehicles or have a home charging solution so they'll buy a kit and then they will they will instill that in the home or they will sort of charged I call that\nThe difficulty as you say though is most breads and most uber drivers don't have all street parking Sony forty percent of the British population has access to all street parking only Fifteen Percent of uber drivers have access to all street parking so therefore the home charging solution\nWill not work or when we want to go from electrifying the

be ... ten Fifteen twenty calls good policy overnight and charge that would be one type of solution the other type of solution we need\nIs we need rapid charging infrastructure in the areas where those people are traveling now the the reason I think why the u._k. charging infrastructure is not as well developed in other countries is because it's a little bit of a catch twenty two there's a catch twenty two where the people who are responsible for rolling out in the charging infrastructure\nDon't have the incentive unless they have clear line of sight into a launch vehicle base of electric vehicles who they know that kind of service\nAnd also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric vehicles and unless they know the charging infrastructure in place so that's why we think the clean Power Plan which is the two hundred million punting investment is a very good way of trying to unlock that catch twenty two that's Jamie Hi ...\n... is our special guest that
