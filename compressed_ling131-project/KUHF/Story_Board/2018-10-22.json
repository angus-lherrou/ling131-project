Russia is threatening to retaliate if President Trump followed through on his decision to withdraw from a long standing nuclear arms control treaty Trump says Moscow has long violated the agreement Moscow accuse us of doing the same\nNPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces treaty was signed it the Nineteen eighties when the Cold War was going strong\nIt eliminated nuclear weapons that the U.S and Soviet Union had deployed around Europe weapons that could have quickly started a catastrophic war in recent years Russia has been working on missiles that the U.S has violate the treaty and on Saturday President Trump said he'd had enough\nBut we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement I go out into weapons were not allowed to put arms\nControl experts warn the U.S has little to gain from withdrawing from the agreement and they fear it could be the beginning of a new arms race Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington\nA caravan of thousands of Central American migrants his back on the move toward the U.S despite Mexico's efforts to stop them at the border with Guatemala they resume their march at first like this morning reporter James Frederick is at the scene\nHere in the central square and thousands of people from the migrant caravan of rise here today but it was a brutal journey to your left the Mexican border this morning before the sun has come up\nAnd then they walked twenty three miles it got up above Ninety degrees today it's very humid here\nThey're now in the central square\nTries to get water food there's the red cross turn into for medical attention and they're hoping to continue north as soon as possible\nJames Frederick in capital Chula Mexico and North Africa hundreds of migrants have charged the borders that that separates Morocco from Spanish enclaves Lucy and then as he does reports one person died about two hundred\nMade it onto that video shows the migrants walking down the street in a celebratory mood right after crossing the migrant who\nDied is believed to have suffered from a heart attack\nThe two Spanish enclaves in North Africa money and so that I separated from Morocco by razor wire doubled fences and militarized border control migrants usually attempt to jump in large numbers to heightened air probability of making it across\nWell certainly it is true and I will say boy is this an interesting time to finish this book [laughter] you know I work on this but for very long time and it's just the odds that\nI Would finish a book about extreme divisiveness and polarization at this particular moment in time but indeed bullying ... as we see now and as we see in my book can be a devastatingly effective way of commanding the political arena\nAnd in the case of Congress the southerners know that they have you know they have an advantage because of the northerners don't feel that they can engage in the same kind of\nDual oriented sort of brutal culture that the southerners can and so there's a you know we we talk about in this period for example there's the great debate about gag rules about in the house well in both houses but particularly in the house trying to make it so that anti slavery petitions cannot be discussed\nOn the floor well I talk about in the book that the gang violence which was trying to do the same thing\nThat that sort of beg the question was there any effective way to push back against that for the northerners in the Eighteen fifty\nWell in the Eighteen fifties they advertise themselves as the party that's going to fight the slave power\nAnd in Congress that has a literal dimension they're they're working alongside southerners and they come to Washington prepared to fight some of them come with weapons and they're ... themselves as being a different kind of northerner\nAnd today we tend to forget about the fact that Abraham Lincoln was well known as a brawl or in a very effective for all or it's one of the ways he consolidated his early political power among the Democrats as he could win with them and street fighting\nRight right and and maintain a sense of humor throughout but yes indeed yeah and it was vicious fighting fishes in those days yeah oh no for sure it was not so much in Congress but um when you look out and about and in the nation at some of it is you know almost statistic it so violent and and brutal\nI gouging year biting exactly exactly\nAt how people react to the violence in Congress at the time do they object or or do they rally behind it isn't just supporting their own gene\nWell initially and and the book kind of talked about this in the Eighteen thirties there's a very small press community\nAnd it's a handful of people in both houses they take notes of the debates they often show the congressman the notes they've taken to make sure they're accurate and\nThey don't really record most of the violence that they'll say things sometimes like the debate became unpleasantly personal at one point and in one case that means someone pulled a gun on somebody else which indeed is unpleasantly personal but a ... a lot of the violence isn't\nReally covered in the press that changes with the telegraph and in the Eighteen fifties when there are more reporters in Washington the press community isn't so insular and people you know within an hour can see something on the floor and then shoot it off to wherever they want to shoot it off to around the nation\nThen people begin to really get a sense of what's going down in the house and Senate and then they do begin to react but their reaction is a really ... our congressmen are under attack will fight back\nAnd so there you see kind of a you know and vicious cycle of violence and hostility breeding violence and hostility from Congress in the nation kind of rebounding back and forth through the vehicle of the press\nWe think of alternative reality\nIt is a fight over the soul of the country itself right\nDuring those moments precisely which is not to say that there aren't other fraud moments and that there are other moments of enormous change but I Do think you know the slavery struggle that civil rights struggle of the Nineteen sixties the question in the late Seventy nine is about precisely how democratic nation the nation would be um all of those things are are sort of peak\nMoments of decision and I think we're experiencing one of those moments now and as it's unfolding of course it's becoming ever more polarized and stark\nYou gotta let me add in the Eighteen nineties there which look very much ... and also a reminder that we lived through all those times\nShakes actually well exactly and that's you know so we lived through them all and after you know in a sense you could say that those moments are kind of debate and not very pleasant kind of debate\nBut that we do live through them and that there are decisions made and there are positive as well as a negative repercussions to those kinds of moments sometimes for change to happen you have\nTo go through that kind of a you know what I Want to call it like a crisis like I almost like a let's say cleansing lonely but there has to be an extreme moment to open the door to change\nAnd I have to say on that note precisely I think we should end this interview and thank you very much for being here and giving us some hope for the future Oh nice to have you here Joanne he's so much for having me Joanne Freeman is a professor of history and American studies at Yale her most recent book is filled with blood violence in Congress and the road to civil war [noise]\n\nComing up philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah and joins us to talk about how we can work together to break the bonds of travels a devotee and reestablish common ground is the democracy test for truth politics and power and\n[noise]\n\nHouston Public media this is like your gift matters local artists featured\nSometimes when you're able to hear what the artist has to say the most important thing you always have programs like art inside [noise] then you're able to connect who are working in a new and much more meaningful way\nIf people are talking in terms of we're going to win this election they're going to lose their ruining the country that kind of thing instead of even saying Democrats or Republicans are ... certain candidate that's an initial sign because it's a deep personalizing\nKind of language and it's easy to move from there to dehumanizing it's easy to demonize opponents and you also look for how much are people interacting and communicating with people of other political tribes\nIf you are living in a cocoon and it's you don't run into people the others where it's hard to talk with them or even when you go home for Thanksgiving and it's hard that's a bad sign\nAlso do you and your friend group view or here only one source of news feed this is a common problem and polarized countries the news itself become\nAnd so if you're only listening to one view presented in that news feed than you are hearing information that reinforces your own beliefs and is not challenge eat\nBoy that sounds familiar to think oh we're on that track here in the United states\nUh certainly I think all of these things I just mentioned a week clearly are and I've been concerned about the trend that we've been going on for at least the last decade\nWe have seen growing polarization really for at least two decades in terms of measuring political attitudes but these kinds of things you know moving toward the tribalism part and this social and psychological part I think we're seeing now the next thing to look at the end is\nWhat kinds of political behavior or actions might happen and that's when we start getting into the consequences for democracy\nAs part of your work in Venezuela you develop some ideas about how a society can overcome extreme polarization who goes to church or ideas we might be able to use now can you describe them\nWhen polarization is emerging that is really important to make people aware that there is a divide and what the consequences are for democracy had enough areas that can be to democracy\nAnd we know we can look at other examples we can look at our past in the United states looking at the civil war at looking at the Nineteen sixties that violence can result we look at Venezuela we see the lessons now\nOnce you get to an extreme level like Venezuela\nWe're in real trouble I mean it's almost too late and what I worry about is how very very difficult it's going to be to recover\nSocial cohesion in this society to recover a level of trust to enable people to live together again\nAnd finally I think we need to reinforce that to overcome polarization and stop the negative consequences for democracy we need to respond to it by reinforcing democratic responses and not and democratic ones\nSo that means people who were in the opposition in opposition political parties\nNeed to work on responding to the needs of the people the desires of the people they need to democratize internally within their party\nThey should not engage in this same polarizing tactics that same kind of ... the other side just crediting of the opponents discredited in even the loyalty of the opponents to the country\nAnd they need to work on organizing voters urging them to vote and to compete electorally but also there are things like institutions that can help to shore up against any kind of\nDemocratic erosion or backsliding so the courts the bureaucracy the military all of these can restrain any kind of abuses and so it's important to try to work against allowing those institutions to become\nPart is and that is for a government or leader to only put in loyalists in those institutions as happened in Venezuela as happened in other countries and are you optimistic that that Americans can do that at this period we have not gone too far along the road that Venezuela talk\nYes we still have time I'm very optimistic what\nI think makes it challenging for the United States I've been doing a comparative study of many countries the ones who had the most pernicious and enduring kinds of polarization that extend into the society are when politics become so polarized around\nUnresolved debates about who is a citizen who has the legitimacy to represent those citizen and what is the national identity\nAnd the United states this is the case because it goes back to the founding of the country on an equal citizenship of African slaves of Native Americans of women\nAnd said that we have now a multi racial democracy we have given rights to women with getting rights gay rights etc\nWe have a diffusion of religion as well and so different claims over the roles of church and state these kinds of foundational debates and differences when they extend you know two hundred years later still unresolved\nI think that is a large part of what's driving our polarization today\nAnd it's emerging in this incivility that we're seeing\nAnd the racial lives they shouldn't have a lot of issues and so we have got to address that if we want to really overcome this polarization well thank you very much for that Jennifer this is a a great way to look at shared spaces and the recovering of\nThe country from polarization thank you for being with us thank you so much\nJennifer ... is a distinguished professor at Georgia State university and leads an International Research group on polarized democracies\n\nWe've heard how polarization contributed to the American civil war and well I don't think a lot of us would argue that things are that bad now the divisions among us still appear to be getting deeper and more intractable both political parties try to maximize their turnout by demonizing the opposition that's a technique mastered by a president who appeals to some of our bassist instinct\nFew have given more thought to what divides and unites us than Kwame Anthony Appiah a professor of philosophy at law at New York university law applies those skills to practical problems is the author of the ethicist column for the New York times his books include cosmopolitan\n... the honor code how moral revolutions happen and most recently the lies that by rethinking identity Kwame Anthony Appiah joins us from his office at NYU it's great to talk with you again has very good to talk to Neal\nIn a world of ever more tribal identity is your book looks at five factors creed country color slash\nAnd culture five factors we use to define ourselves and that others used to define us on examination none of these turns out to be simple all of them are based on the stakes mess isn't your own store your identity and a capital of the contradictions within and among\nWhat is supposed to be bright line definitions\nYes I mean I suppose one reason I thought about this so much and for so long is because I'm you know my mother was English my father was gone and I live in the United states\nI come from a particular as everybody does from particular class background and so on and all of these things mean that when I meet people for the first time very often that Saudi puzzled by by what I might be since since I'm sort of brown skin and many people the guy looked like an Indian but I don't talk very much like an Indian\nAnd um don't sound like a dicey I felt like they say is I was raised to talk like you see\n'em and in fact my my mother who is no longer live I I watch some video of her the other day and I realize that the person my mother most sounds like\nA is the English queens she had a very very particular kind of English accent\nFor each of the categories that you talk about for identity are vastly oversimplified but why do you think they became such power\nWell I think because we were sort of programmed to sink in these essentially tribal punished times because presumably because it was adaptive a long time ago on the as where evolution race of anti when we were just becoming a species and we're trying to deal with the fact that\nHuman beings lived in small groups which are competing with one another and we needed\nA psychology that would made good the groups held together so that they could compete it's very easy to turn on ... and human beings\nAnd so that's one reason and then once it's turned on it takes to turn it off so that's why they're so persistent I think that's a a big problem\nAnd I think there are solutions to it was one of which is obviously that unfortunately people have more than one identity and so sometimes we can use one identity to\nUndo the the bad effects of another ah for example by the differences in their views about lots of political questions and in many ways I think people's physical views are generated by the sense that well this is the view of my tribe\nThan by thinking well do I actually think about is\nThe vast majority of people um but I Do not think that as it were all the ... should be permitted and the vast majority will also think that many should be and the disagreement is about the boundaries but the party's represent essentially the basically the too extreme views that\nThe Democrats currently holds the as where there should be no limitations of toilet emotions and the Republicans hold and as many as possible in fact let's try and change the
