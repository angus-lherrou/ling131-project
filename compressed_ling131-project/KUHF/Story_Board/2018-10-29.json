M. C. hosting a job fair to recruit engineers and designers with Alan gee refining or ethylene experience November said at the end of the sweets details at technique F. M. C. dot com\nWhen a third term so it was a war that really in a sense gave him a second opportunity\nAnd the country rallied around him and of course the fact that we ended up winning the war brings him down to us through history as one of the three great presidents of American history\nYou said earlier that Roosevelt didn't end the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization\nEnded the effort or your biography does not shy away from\nFranklin Roosevelt mistakes or from his failure to take a Jewish refugees from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully his decision to turn Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak\nAnd if you look at the polling data throughout his presidency\nAt least in the Gallup polls he never went below fifty percent and see what a contrast that is to the current incumbent was never achieved fifty percent in his going on two years in the White House she\nNow it speaks to Roosevelt ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles shortcomings they were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue Jewish knowledge cost\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country\nWhich was very much and immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression and that bringing in lots of immigrants would add to the unemployment rolls\nWell clearly the rising disparities in the economy that was part of it this is the same period where we are starting to see\nThe acceleration of the decline of unionization which was an important factor in making sure that workers shared in the growth in the private sector\nWe're also starting to see the impact of inflation and we're starting to see the beginnings of what becomes this very powerful change in our financial markets that ended up rewarding those the very top significantly\nIt's a big moment I Would say if you're looking for a very visible change was around Watergate and Vietnam it's at these moments when the trust in government falls off the cliff if you go back into the fifties and through the sixties you see sixty\nSeventy percent of Americans saying they trust the government to do the right thing\nAll or most of the time by the second half of the Nineteen seventies that's plummeted\nAnd it never really improves and so you've got these changes and trust the government that start to go along with a sense of the government is not on your side\nAnd that is reinforced by these changes in the marketplace and the inability of our government to step in and begin to provide some support and assistance to Americans who are losing\nIn the new economic game I Am not saying all these things are Curt ones what I Am saying is that the decline of trust in government which occurs in the seventies\nAnd is now essentially an on cured problem moves into the eighties where new set\nOf challenges began to emerge and there was an interaction between them between those preexisting a low level of trust in government with a growing economic set of pressures from the marketplace and the lack of response of them is by the government to that so there's interaction between\nThis low level of trust in government\nAnd then as you move into the eighties and beyond the widening economic disparity and the paralysis in Washington and responding to that\nYou've written that political parties were created to reach out to ordinary Americans and get them involved in politics get them engaged a wealth and as you look at the uh the partisan divide today what happened\nPolitical parties have been transformed by a set of reforms beginning in the early Nineteen seventies when power was put in the hands of the folks who turned out for primary as it was a glorious change\nPursued under the belief that this would expand democracy and take power out in the hands of corrupt\nUnresponsive party officials from out of the smoke filled room exactly and it was after the riots in Chicago in Nineteen sixty eight in the sense that the political parties have become just solidified around\nAn unchanging a set of party leaders white urban and really out of touch with the New America well that well intentioned change\nHas gone in a direction that was never anticipated party activists who participate most regularly in the primaries are fairly small number of folks usually ten to Fifteen Percent of the electorate turnout for a primary election and they tend to be\nLiberal more so than the country and far more conservative\nThan the rest of the country or even members of their party who are just rank and file folks what this has meant is that those were being nominated\nAnd the Democratic and especially the Republican Party couch towel to those who are responsible\nFor their nomination not to the majority of Americans and we ended up with candidates and I think this is particularly true in the Republican side who are not holding to the majority opinion they're beholden to the relatively small number of party activists\nWho will punish them by denying them the nomination or putting up\nOpponents who will fight them for the nomination if they don't maintain that strict allegiance to very conservative party goals and so the political party which was meant to be this mass mobilizing organization that would really\nBring together the Democratic power of majorities has been crippled because it's been taken over by idiot logically extreme party activists particularly in the Republican Party to ironically isn't it\nYeah it's very ironic and it's tragic for America because we now have these continuing episodes\nIn which we see a majority of Americans on one side and political parties in Washington pursuing policies are quite opposed to it and I think it's been most clear\nDuring the ... the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act which most Americans wanted to see improved not repealed\nIs a dramatic example\nWe've seen a number of States Institute reforms to moderate the primary process a so called jungle primaries for example in California where the top to run off against each other no matter which party they're from its its intended to promote moderate D.C promising that\nI'm hopeful but to be honest I think the story and that is not clear yet there are some examples where\nThe so called jungle or open primary have worked to reward moderate candidates in other cases not so so I think we're studying it and there are other ideas are out there uh then I think we're need to explore this is a vital part of our effort to rejuvenate\nOur democracy is to get a handle on the parties that dictate who are the candidates we get to choose between come November\nDo you have suggestions for how that could be done\nThis is a sample of trial and error I don't think there's a kind of a magic play book there have been a variety of efforts geared to this uh I think the open primary and California is one that many of us are watching closely I think the results so far I've been mixed\nThere are suggestions about creating more of a kind of run off system you've heard ranked choice voting as a possibility is being tried in Minnesota I think the main too you know and Maine and you know right choice voting intriguing idea and I think the results there are also a bit mixed\nAnd deserved further analysis I did not think there's a magic bullet I think the most fundamental thing is to engage the majority of Americans when you have about half the country sitting out presidential elections\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger numbers sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme\nThese are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies moderate politicians these are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced\nThen the next primary the sense of moderation response of this responsibility to the majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down and the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasized building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on salient top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process\nAnd that brings us to a point where we have opinion polls that show the policies that would reduce inequality you know higher minimum wage for example post show those are broadly popular but those have good norms difficulties getting enacted ... is that the result of this polarization of the political parties that using\nAbsolutely I think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant vital signs of a democracy is whether those in office\nListen to what the majority prefer\nAnd America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies facing our country particularly those affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government\nThat are on moved they don't seem to be motivated to respond to what most Americans prefer instead they couched how to the idiot logically extreme activists within their party they know if they don't follow the party line\nThat they will be replaced and that has become a tremendous corrupting influence\nThe path forward for beginning to address the deep end growing economic inequality is with America is well known we don't need a study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed\nAnd has been unable to respond to this transformation of our economy\nThat is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America I'm actually an optimistic person by nature but
