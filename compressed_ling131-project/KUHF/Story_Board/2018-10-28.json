well sometimes I think you know turned your way but sometimes applause you when I was with this story from the writer to ...\nI met a man from Long Island and at a bar by chance a year after I moved to New York and right away I liked him we walked from the bar\nTo a twenty four hour diner in the East Village and got grilled cheese sandwiches and French fries and drank bad room temperature coffee and talked for hours until a stranger came over and asked if we can to officiate our wedding right there at the sticky table by the bathroom\nBy then it was light outside\nI'd known to man for nine hours and I was powered by an engine of pure enthusiasm\nI said sure why not yes\nI waitress rolled her eyes but agreed to be the witness at least near an unofficial document with catch\nNot long after I learned that the man I diner married had worked for many years opening clams and oysters in bars and it had left him with a calm clear eyed appreciation what I mean is he didn't get worked up when he talked about a wasters not like some people I knew\nHe didn't insist that I Try one particular variety grown off one remote island with nothing but a square as Lehman because anything more would be disrespectful to the oyster\nI liked to history is just fine but not that much when I eat them raw by the death and they were occasionally delicious fat an intact and salty slipping out of pristine shelves just as often they were nothing special\nLike mouthful just land brackish jelly or the sled off coins from deep pockets or the fermented milk mythical sea creature they didn't seem worth the hassle\nBut there was something about the way he liked oysters keenly and quietly without fetish or hyperbole that made me reconsider we carried a hundred along with a jar of chopped Charlotte's and vinegar to my friend's apartment one New Year's eve\nWe ate them smoked on crackers and hot and pan rest and when we visited friends in New Orleans roasted and garlic butter Frankel with pulverized anchovies on cayenne pepper then we walked down the street with grease stains on our clothes toward music\nWhen my parents came to visit the apartment we shared I blitz butter and a food processor with hot sauce lemon zest and garlic he sat at the table outside and talked an open oysters with them while I let the charcoal from my tiny travel size grill\nIt took a few minutes for the butter to start bubbling to make a tank ... with the oyster liquor and for the meat to heat through then we ate and rounds putting a dozen or so have shells on the grill every time we ran out\nWhat my mother wanted to know after we'd empty the bottle of wine was if he and I ever talked about getting married not that she reminded us living together no it wasn't that\nNot that mattered these days not at all [noise] she wasn't old fashioned she insisted that it would be so nice to know more about my long term plan\nI told her the truth that I didn't have any long term plans but

take a closer look at what exactly Congress and the Trump Administration did to change the Affordable CARE Act\n[noise] all that and more after the news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine

congressman in Washington DC his district was actually won by ... by two points in twenty sixteen he's being challenged by a local businessmen so it's one of those key races in a Los Angeles suburb that will show us whether this trend is\nDefinitive the local business when used to be a Republican himself right and so like there he may arguably have some bipartisan appeal\nRight and polls show that race is super close\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're focusing on the race for the house of representatives with NPR's Dominican much narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak Dominique ... take me to the future of you and I sitting in the studio and election night where the cabs have your browser will be open to\nYou know I'm old school I don't even have the browsers I use paper and I've got my list here or that and because I'm political editor I Am going to take some liberty\nZoom out and grab a bunch of races in one big bucket so fine fine this is the editor everybody subtle and here we go this is the Obama Trump districts okay from Oklahoma to Trump right these are districts that President Obama won in twenty twelve\nBut President Trump wound up winning twenty sixteen not gonna talk about all these races\nBut I Want to talk about where they are because it's really indicative of\nHow well Trump did and uh what Democrats need to do to win the house\nA on election day or for Republicans to hold it most of these places are either in the Midwest and if you look at at all of them globally there in New York and New Jersey the ... the Philadelphia suburbs\nAre all the way up through upstate New York a lot of these districts there's one that's uh just outside St Louis on the Illinois side\nYou look at all of those places and I to me you know if Democrats can do well in the half a dozen or so tossup races that are within this Obama Trump bucket then they probably take back the house\nFun fact three out of four Iowa districts therefore I Would districts three of them were Obama Trump districts and two of them are pretty close tossup races\nRight now a part of that might have to do with the even this of redistricting but that's a conversation for another\nFound to put a shot for Iowa out there that's off a I'm going to go with Amy McGrath in Kentucky sixth district she is running against anti bar he a as a Republican to foresee the Democrat\nOr not this is a district that has been pretty hardcore Republican Trump won it by Fifteen points at any McGrath is a marine veteran and she is one also one of those democratic women candidates that has gained a lot of prominence on the national stage\nOne of many uh one of many women veterans running on the Democratic side this time\nYes absolutely I mean we have quite a few ... at least historically speaking women combat vets running for Congress she raised three times what Andy Barr did and the third quarter this year and part of what I'm watching is first of all if she can flip this kind of a district that's really stunning\nBut I'm also watching a lot of these combat vets because what we do know from pulling it is that voters tend to give women and democratic women perhaps especially ... much less of an edge on things like national security and so on as they might give her Republican man and so this is sort of a test case for that\nSo we've been saying all along that the Democrats are feeling confident that they can take control of the house but of course we don't know what's going to happen on election day we talk for on the show about the legislative stakes what could Congress do\nNext year depending on who's in charge whatever the political stakes what does it mean to the Democratic party if it at the end of the day they don't we take control the house and for the second election cycle in a row\nThey've they've missed their mark and and and they've lost it'd\nBe an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right\nNow there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party is in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house then they're ... they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership\nWill be in Tim take the flip side effect if Republican somehow keep control of the house of representatives what are Republicans talking about the next day\nThe president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh and and on the left there's ... there's going to be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with the Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost and twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened\nThis election we know one thing is for sure if Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes they're going to be stepping on the gas or an exclamation point\nNPR's the minute come on to narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking that You're welcome and Dominican stick with us because now it is time for race of sweets\nI'm running for United States Senate Tyler I Need your help we will never backed down by and if we [noise] we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia the minute ... you're still with me how's it going hey there were gonna bringing\nJohnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny\nHello so the medical let's start with you who are the candidates and the Republican is Brian Kemp there's a secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black and female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin Abrams has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as this election comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nYou this is drawing a federal lawsuit Kemp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base\nAnd he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as Kemp likes to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties that at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag with that Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier\nNational races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for in the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut campaigns are done are really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStates even you could just be standing tax rating liberal she's an extremist campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand\nWhat he's getting out there eight rooms I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know everyone's talked about her policy proposal she's very smart but how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources\nAre they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that I'd Abrams needs to inspire voters in the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand that he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race and\nI Would have back up and look at the generic ballot issue again because one thing once again this is where the gender gap pops up in the big its way among independents so when you look at Democrats Ninety seven percent of democratic women say they're going to vote democratic zero percent zero day they are going to vote Republican you\nCan just tell you that you will help and pull polling exactly what you do not see the numbers zero\nZero zero percent of democratic with it so that surprised me but\nGetting to what's important nine and ten Republican men and women say yeah I'm going to vote Republican independence independent men prefer the Republican by two percentage points which is a say roughly evenly split independent women prefer the Democrats by twenty three percentage points so once again when you're looking at the gender gap that is where it's going to\n... and I look at unmarried women look at white college educated women they are really driving a lot of the ... election and the opposition to President Trump\nSo last question on this uh what were the issues that that voters seem to be most motivated by well\nYou know the one saving grace for President Trump here is that the economy and jobs continue to rate as the top issue for a for people now it's not a huge percentage of people but it's it's the the largest number of what's asked here and when you look at a second is healthcare third is immigration\nBut the divide between the parties are two completely different universes the two parties live and Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves with healthcare ads they're running healthcare healthcare healthcare everywhere\nDemocrats believe that the top issue followed by the way by climate change Republicans see jobs in the economy as top with immigration as not too far behind which explains President Trump's attempts at trying to wrap up the base and talking about immigration and this caravan coming from Central America\nAnd funny you should mention that because later in the show Danielle and I will have a long conversation about health care with NPR's Scott Horsley looking at how it's played out of the campaign but more importantly what the actual votes have done or would have done and what the Trump Administration has done on Obamacare\nAs later on the show right Danielle Kurtzleben ... thank you so much thank you You're welcome [noise]\n\nVisit the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow feels like there's always a few major stories that dominate the headlines one person\nIs now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare the drooling international outrage over the killing of a Washington Post columnist has the Trump Administration\nOn the rise of the United states calling a growing caravan of Central American migrants a national\nEmergency and because of that other really important stories often get overlooked so every week we take a few minutes to focus in on one story that didn't get that much attention this week and she knew that we always have NPR's Ron Elving\nAll around good to be with you Scott ... everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become forest health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think of another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same\nAre reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids\nSo the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether and we're going to end the ... of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible problem\nSo what are some specific things that this law does\nOne of the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage\nWhich was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addiction at backs the creation of comprehensive opioid\nCovering centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this\nUh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies additional measures including new enforcements drinks for the United States Postal service so that they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids this bill us it signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling off\nYes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services a data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate that the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years\nHe used the word slapped and that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand from\nSixty four thousand the previous year a new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last month to Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen\nSo if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that is at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where we are both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here is uh to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions of that is ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money put into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen\nBut here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least to that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank you Scott\n[noise]\nThis is the politics shell from NPR we're going to take a quick break and be right back [noise]\nEverybody's talking about politics but who's listening we are we're listening to candidates local leaders activists in voters who choose the direction our country said was the next two

every weekend in mid term election after\nAll the votes mentality meets weekly focused on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states is\nUm [noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare\n[noise] the Democrat has to be Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises that\nDoes seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher tale of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just\nOne vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear\nI Wonder and I'm just guessing here 'cause who knows I Wonder if they might be a bit ginger about the specific provisions they might be attacking like preexisting conditions\nI think there are definitely some Republican activist who will want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced in the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda but Danielle is right there will also certainly be some wariness given the backlash they've gotten already\nAnd if for Republicans gained some seats in the Senate ah three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop or repeal effort like they did this year That's NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben thank you very much you could [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow so every week we focus on one race and we already talked about the Georgia governor's race in the show but here's the thing is just a week and a half\nLeft before election day a lot of big races to talk about so this week we're going to add a second race of the week and to do that we've got Dominican lots in our old NPR hate him in a co pay there and we're gonna bring bread jasper's of member station ... in Phoenix a breath hey hey so medical let's start with you catch us up to speed who's running in this race why does it matter\nWell no matter who wins here the Arizona Senate races going to make history it's elected eleven senators since becoming a state Nineteen twelve none of them though have been a woman and that's definitely going to change this November that's because voters here will either elect democratic representative cure students cinema\nShe's a former social worker or Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally she's retired from the military with the rank of colonel and she was the first woman to fly in combat\nThis is for the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake who decided not to run again because he said he just couldn't see myself getting elected given how the Republican Party has gone one way and and he's gone the other way Brett what is the strategy that that makes Sally and send them are taking into this campaign what if they both been focusing on\nWell both of them have tried to really make themselves to some degree cinemas project of remaking has lasted many years she was in the state legislature in a very\nProgressive member of that years ago and she's been one of the most moderate members of the house of representatives in Congress whereas mix Sally also started off as a moderate congresswoman but in this campaign she's really embrace President Trump\nSeparate we could really say this for for most Senate races at this point in an election but this has gotten\nReally negative ... we were in harm's way and uniformed here's the cinema was protesting us anything to to seem to think she can say whatever she wants as long as she shows pictures of herself in uniform your show by just to get a link to show by about anything\nAnd amidst all this what are you hearing from the actual voters that you talk to\nPeople talk about the ads um they they are disgusted by them you know one particular voter you know it was really striking she didn't want to give me her name but she said that she drives two hours a day on her commute and she fears these ads on the radio\nOh my God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible honestly it reminds me as petty school ground catty girl just going at each other\nSo I just prefer to distance myself from that so you might not vote in that race because of that crack\nWas talking to a a political scientist here who said she wasn't sure if that was a strategy by mix Sally but you know the people who might be turned off from voting are people who are a less likely to vote in the first place and the women and so those might both be\nConstituencies that cures instead of I Would meet so you know the negative ads are definitely having an effect especially if they're like irrelevant to you know important salient issues\nYou know people like to say that negative ads don't work and that they don't like negative ads but the thing is negative ads do work on the fact of the matter is that cinema was leading in these polls her favorability ratings were much higher and
