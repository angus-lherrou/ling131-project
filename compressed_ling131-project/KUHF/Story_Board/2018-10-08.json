developing over many years with the concerted attention of adults and a lot of other people I don't think it's something that naturally emerges I think if something does has to be very intentional about cultivating\nThe rule of parents and encouraging and setting an example the moral development of children you're listening to humankind David for like\nRichard why sports spends a lot of time pondering how to bring out the best and young people\nHow to stimulate their emotional and moral development he's the founder of an inner city school in Boston\nMember at Harvard School of education and school of government\nFamily counselor and a father\nAnd he sees the tough road many use our own they're\nWorried about kids who don't have empathy I worry about kids who become nurses cystic I'm not talking about most kids but I'm Talking about a large number of kids and I'm a you know enough kids to be really concerned about [noise]\nAnd [noise] you know I was very aware of this when my kids were growing up um that I was part of this culture of parenting and that\nYou know there are many subtle ways in which I think a privileged my kids happiness and self esteem over their morality um you know I didn't require them to return phone calls from friends I let them right off kids they found annoying I didn't make them reach out to a friend was kid on the playground [noise]\nYou know I think in all these ways nobody subtle day to day ways we can prioritize our kids happiness over morality and um we end up you know with kids who are less moral but I think ironically we also ended up with kids who are less happy than all this attention to our kids Nazism making them happier either [noise]\nBoy sport is author of the parents we mean to be explores how well intentioned adults sometimes seen it virtually under cut the healthy development of children\nIn particular he critiques the modern movement to bolster a child self esteem which says voice board can elevate a young person's happiness over traits that may actually matter more\nI think that we just basically have a backward I think we have this idea that if you have self esteem you're going to be more caring and you have better relationships and you'll be more productive at work\nBut I think in reality the reverse is more likely to be true that if you help kids become caring and tuned in to other people they're going to have better relationships are going to be better friends are going to be better parents are going to be better grandparents\nAnd those good relationships are the most durable powerful sources of real self esteem that we have\nUm if you help kids to be self reflective if you help them to be competent if you help them to be diligent you help them to do with frustration they're going to be productive at work\nOf the moral of a moral compass um so you know sort of empathy appreciation um is one important aspect of a moral compass but there are people who have empathy an appreciation for not always honest and who don't always act with integrity [noise] um\nAnd sometimes they become dishonest because of the embassy big big because\nThey are so sensitive to the lives of others they don't want to hurt the other but I think that's a good that's important point\nSo I think that's right and so that's why I Am trying to complicate the the view of the of the moral compass in a sense because um I don't think it's one thing I think people on one aspect of a moral compass can be very strong and other aspects of the moral compass maybe less stronger\nNeeded meaning they're more dimly aware of right and wrong in certain areas well and I think there's some people who really know right from wrong and have a great capacity for moral\nReasoning let's say [noise] um but have trouble doing what's right for a variety of reasons um because they're afraid of conflict let's say or because they're overwhelmed with shame or or anger [noise]\nUm I think there is some people's vice versa who in most situations really can act with integrity but there are some situations where they have a real trouble figuring out what right and wrong is what you know they had trouble reasoning through moral dilemmas [noise]\nUm [noise] you know there's some people with very strong principals I'm sure we can all think of people like this in our own life very strong principals high integrity but they seem kind of it up to ... or a hundred and ten ethic and their intimate relationships\nSo again you know they're in one sense they have a strong moral compass another's arena in another sense they don't have a strong moral compass\nSo Richard why sport distinguishes between an impulse to do what you may feel is the right thing in a given situation and the ability to act on that impulse skillfully in guiding the moral development of children he says it starts with focusing on basic human interactions\nI think parents do have to be very purposeful about this you know they have to insist that their kids are\nNice to the waiter or waitress I'm to the bus driver to the custodian to the to the store clerk they have to point out to their kids injustice they have to insist that their kids reach out to the friend let's get on the playground [noise]\nYou know I hear stories you know mom was just talking to me by being in a birthday party and you know seeing a kid of birthday party a four year olds and a four year old is putting his fingers in every slice of the pizza and the mom is sitting there and doesn't say anything [laughter]\nAnd you know again it's a nice day to day ways that we you know can either reinforce our kids selfishness or send a very different message which is you cannot do that [noise]\nOf you know on the playground I see little kids interrupting older kids in the middle of games and parents thinking it's cute and\nUm you know again this is a time to send a message that he's older kids are playing a game and you can't you know you have to be aware of that and it's that day to day does that I think is the primary way in which we developed a moral compass or core and our kids you know when we are really attentive to those things day to day\nThe same token you talk a lot about how children pay close attention to the details of how their parents handle interactions with other people what kind of lessons do kids draw from their parents\nErrors and we're managing them that's\nA wonderful left so so this is kind of a counter forced to watch for so many of us is is a natural inclination to kind of cover up and be ashamed and not really a acknowledge and\nYeah I mean I think you know we you know when kids are very young and then there's a level\nOf discourse of conversation we really can't have we really can't have with them\nAbout our philosophy as they're not sort of old enough to understand our philosophers but I think we typically dramatically underestimate or ... kids capacity to really understand our mistakes and and flaws and to appreciate that we have mistakes and flaws\nYou know I'll give you an example I sometimes can be too critical of people and so I Will tell my kids you know\nSometimes I'm too critical of people and I think in saying that on both acknowledging I'm saying something important both that don't always trust my views of people you should view them sometimes critically or reflect on that because they're not always right [noise] but I'm also saying to them you know it's okay to be fought\nI'm not holding up this impossible standards [noise]\nWould you describe the atmosphere in which you are under intense pressure to achieve a school how that pressure is exerted on kids\nAre and how they're affected by [noise]\nSo there's research and this is primarily soon I aloof hours research at Columbia about\nThe rates of different kinds of problems in my house when kids behavior problems delinquency substance abuse [noise]\nUm and depression anxiety and disconcerting news here is that affluent kids look a lot like low income kids in terms of these risks in terms of these measures [noise]\nThat ah it's actually middle class working class kids who are doing significantly better than low income kids and affluent kids it's surprising how it's surprising and you know and despite all the odd the stresses that low income kids are under\nOn emotionally or how a lot of this is happening on a non verbal them it's all happening on a non verbal unconscious level\nActually the research shows that the first ingredient in ... report is full attention if you pay full attention the rest happens automatically you just are are getting into step with the other person and then that are from that arises good feeling\nIn your book social intelligence you describe the way of connecting with people called attuned meant that involves giving your full attention to the other person what does it look like when we are deeply attuned\nWell let's ask what it looks like to the other person when you're deeply uttered with him\nThat person feels felt a person feels heard that person feels listen to in other words when you're fully engaged in pay full attention by the way to do that you have to put away your blackberry and you know turn away from your laptop\nAnd all of that you mean you even have to turn off your cell phone\nHa ha ha ha ha you can let it ring cannot answer\nAnd if you a tune that way you know it\nBecause in your mind there no distractions you're completely concentrated on the person that hand the other person feels that had the person senses it\nAnd uh it's very gratifying that's those are the moments we have a an interaction with another person where you use the word some particle really quick\nI just really quick because you're both fully present\n\n\n\nIn the writing studio of Daniel Goldman's home looking out on the bucolic Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts he has studied and deeply pondered the brain and behavioral sciences\nDialogues with leading researchers are hurt on an audio series entitled wired to connect with the psychology doctorate from Harvard Dan is both a trained therapist and an award winning journalist\nIs quest is to understand how we can tap into natural brain capacity that support more enlightened and socially harmonious lives\nWell attuned is the basis of empathy and a as a poll economics beautifully clear there are three very different kinds of empathy each with different consequences for it to him and and for the course of an interaction our relationship the first is\nA purely cognitive it's just understanding how the other person's thinking about things in perspective taking\nAnd uh if you understand how a person the terms in which a person is thinking or how they're seeing something then you can put things to them in a way that resonates more with them and\nIs that a matter of putting yourself in their shoes sometimes that's what she used that phrase putting yourself and other issues is used to describe perspective taking could be a smelly ...\nHa ha ha ha I I actually am not recommending actually putting yourself in the person's shoes because they're fungal diseases that can be spread but that's a different show I'm sure [noise]\nUh the second kind of empathy is a feeling list it's this non verbal report the sense of uh when you're upset I'm Upset when you said I feel sad when\nYou're angry I feel your anger a and that is a the kind of empathy the\nFirst creates is essential for chemistry for and and it's in moments of chemistry when things work at their best between people whether it's you know people dating or people in a business meeting so it's very important there's a downside to this and that uh for the um\nUh care taking her health professions or a social work and nursing and so on [noise] if you are with people day in and day out who are upset who are in pain or distressed or angry or depressed\nAnd you're simply open to their feelings in the Washington to you it can lead to a\nEmotionally exhaustion and you can get burned out it needs to burn out and and the ash that is actually not to close down\nUnfortunately too many professions socialized people to protect themselves by treating people as objects rather than people I think that's wrong I think you can stay open emotionally if you're self regulation skills are strong it is if you can manage your own distress\nSo that you can take it in but you don't have to let it define how you feel then you'll be okay and as part of that learning how to let it go after you've taken it and\nThat's the essence of a managing distressing emotions as to register and then let it go people who are ruminate to obsess who can't stop thinking about it are the people who end up getting you know it's too anxious to depressed\nAnd ah that that leads to burn out as you said\nSo embassy requires that this second level you're describing the being with the other person's feelings\nA willingness to take in what the person is feeling but a healthy processing of empathy doesn't require that you then get anxiety ridden from it\nYeah exactly exactly you can register but stay centered basically the third kind of empathy than a is concerned for the other people not only do I understand her thinking you're feeling but if you're in\nNeed unprepared to help you if I can and that's of course the basis for compassion so ah embassy is extraordinarily important human\nDaniel Goldman reports that scientists have identified a system in the human body he calls the social brain\nYou'd orchestrate the mechanisms of our interactions with people as well as how we think and feel about those relationships\nWhen two people are in contact as each one the social brain continually adjusts and attuned to the other social awareness can be consciously developed\nA great thing\nSo you can cultivate these abilities like empathy Richard Davidson a nerve scientists who study compassion has found each of us has an emotional style\nAh some of us are very quick to anger some of his very slow some of us are\nA carry emotions like the people who burnout just can't stop thinking about two in the morning comes back to you and some people can let it go and that this defines a lot of our quality of life and what his research is suggesting with your friends are interesting is that with the right training you\nCan go into better direction to actually a skill that we can improve at it's a ... muscle we can exercise our emotional style is not set at birth is not just genetic it's something that can be cultivated\nAnd train and so how do we ah improve our capacity for compassion\nWhile I think the first step is to pay attention you know ah I once when I was at the New York times wrote an article on homeless people this was in the early eighties when homelessness was first becoming a big problem\nAnd my training in psychology is is a clinical psychologist so I was going out with a social worker teams that were bringing food to homeless people and they had around in the Upper West side\nAnd you know it's Seventy eight street in the media news or any and she's been camped there for several days and we bring her sandwich and then\nIn the park we make our Central Park we make the rounds and they're like six different people and we bring them food and so on as I saw these people and talk to the workers about it it struck me that each of them had a very clear psychiatric diagnosis\nAnd that the reason homelessness was all of a sudden problem was they had closed the big metal hospitals and failed to open community clinics which we're supposed to have replaced them what I was became interested in was the phenomena that people\nFirst were shocked by homeless seeing someone homeless\nAnd then later never noticed them we habituated to the home as you might see someone who was homeless how the corner of your all your walk on by you know there was we adapted\nTo a situation which was very compassionate so my argument is that ... the active compassion begins with full attention just as report you have to really see
