see it totally packed wall to wall every inch is full everything's at hand I mean she had that pay board on the wall that Paul child her husband always designed for her from the earliest kitchen in Paris I'm that peg board that he'd put up on the walls painted\nSticker pans draw big black outlandish champion and each thing you know fish molds and things and put the put the hook up and hanged those pan so that you could grab them and use it wasn't about displaying them was about being able to grab them use them put them back\nAnd I just love that [laughter] it was a workshop and I often think of kitchen tools that way you know yes\nAnd I'm speaking of tools I Want to get to her and knives because she was a massive ... love her and she has introduced us all to those magnetic strips\n[noise] yes yes if you go to see her kitchen um there there's between the windows in the kitchen over the sink or countertop\nThere's a magnetic nice strip a couple of them and she doesn't end usual thing that I've never really seen anyone else too which is that she put them vertically up and down between the windows and then sticks and knives across ours honestly you know in ... and kind of range from big too small and\nUm you know that's kind of brilliant it uses some dead space that no one ever really uses people always think that you're supposed to hang those things horizontally

them more functional\nShe would've loved you thing in her own twisted way I'm\nQuite third I said I didn't say that\nAnd I realized it didn't really mean it that way so and what about the Cuisinart what's you know about Julian ... is not because for me it seems like she was the original poster child right\nShe really was she got her hands on a robo coup which is the French company whose design was brought to America by quizzing art and sold as you know the first food processors in the early Nineteen seventies she got her hands on one\nAnd really said this is it this is the greatest thing I mean she was into tradition but also into you know making it modern making it more doable for home cooks and you know one of the things she kept talking about was\nFisher moose that you take fish and you pounded the mortar and pencil for hours and you put it through the ... and you know to get the silky texture consistency and she said you can do it in a few seconds and the food processor and now everyone remaking fish mood suddenly\nShe got everything [laughter] you know but you know the rest\nOf it was true it certainly sped up a lot of cooking for people people fell in love with it because she talked about it all the time and she used it and she had issues with the quakes and on that [laughter]\nI tested food processors um one of the things that always annoyed me about the Cuisinart is it has this little safety feature on the food pusher the thing that pushes the food down to shoot\nSo there's anger is don't go down to shoot I just\nWent right out I don't get a metal bar that goes from this pushing a device and has to engage with the base in order for the machine to go and that's of course smart but it means you have to cut food down to sit in the shoot she famously [laughter] whatever\nProducers Jeff Drummond who also used to produce our show way back in the day told me this story about her and he said in front of Cuisinart executives who are watching a demonstration she was using a Cuisinart and she said oh this silly thing I just stick a knife in order to make it go so I can even open\nAnd she did not care that they were standing [laughter]\nFive have safety

I think they that they that he certainly got some street cred within the local Democratic Party when he decided to vote against cat and\nWell and I think that you know this is a guy who showed some independence in a lot of ways in that way in one but let's listen to one of his TV ads and I think you'll see why it sounds a whole lot different than some of the other Democrats across the country more\nRadical who wants to eliminate during my support on Monday President Trump's border wall extremes on the left and right I Want to cut defense spending I don't want our troops in a fair fight I Want them to have the best [noise]\nListen to the Iraqi says he supports the ice and he said that he supports President Trump's border wall how many Democrats across the country would say that that raise my eyebrows any quotes Ronald Reagan said he believes in peace through strength he also said no socialized medicine and know cutting the Affordable CARE Act now that's a line to walk\nThat's right there's not a lot of time left before election day and I knew that we've all been talking about head of the ups and downs in this race but Scott what's the civically are you looking for between\nNow and November six you think maybe you could give us somewhat of a clue about what will happen election day\nWell one of the one of the biggest things that we saw this week was just the insane amount of money the Democratic candidates have have brought in house candidates all over the country bringing in ... the the type of money that sometimes you see Senate can candidates bringing\nSenate candidates in beta Iraq's case bringing in presidential campaign level numbers there is just a ton\nOf donor enthusiasm on the Democratic side the Kennedy type a ton of money it's my question is what are they going to do with it at a certain point you can't buy more TV ads on TV Time is taken up so how do they use this money do they use it on on door knocking on get out the vote efforts do they use it on\nDigital advertising I'm just really curious to see where that money goes and how they can leverage that advantage that they have because again the\nThe divide between the party an fundraising was was really striking\nAnd also can they spend it in a way that lays down some permanent infrastructure for Democrats in states where they haven't had\nMuch of one yeah given it gives you something that you really watching these last couple of weeks\nOkay look the fact is you're now starting to hear that turned out in this election could be a record could be as high as it's been since the mid Nineteen sixties another time of social and cultural upheaval\nI talked to Michael McDonald who's the turnout expert at the University of Florida keeps the big turnout database that everybody looks at ... and he said that he's looking at essentially\nFor a markers for indicators for why he thinks that turnout is going to be that high for mid term okay so that there was record special election turnout\nHigh primary turnout a high degree of self reported interest in the election and high levels of early voting and we're seeing intensity and all of those metrics absolutely and he said when all four of those are pointing in one direction he\nSaid you know look it just seems to point to the fact that this is this could be an election that is higher turnout than most people have seen in their lifetimes perimeter\nAnd we should explain that even higher turnout ... somewhere between forty five fifty\nSome of the electorate voting at my watch\nI'm watching the immigration debate I think that now that the Brett Kavanaugh moment has come and gone I'm not saying it didn't help Republicans get more energized but I Do think that Donald Trump is looking for another culture war issue\nThat he can use to energize his base that's fascinating the caravan of\nPeople coming through Mexico from Central America on ... potentially on their way to the U.S border is something that he's been tweeting about I think that what we've seen is when the immigration debate focuses on border security\nUm or abolishing ice than Republicans when when the immigration debate focuses on taking kids away from their parents Democrats win so I'm watching that a caravan of potential immigrants to the U.S and seeing if it's going to blow up into a big issue before election\nDay that's really interesting and it's also an issue that I think makes Donald Trump feel very comfortable right like this is what he ran on\nWell he's a culture warrior and immigration was his number one issue he wrote down the golden escalator and said Mexico was sending rapists do the United states\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that is fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court [noise] All right that was NPR's Scott Detrow Jim ... and Mara Liasson thank you all thank you You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is a positive show from NPR I must have a holiday it feels like every week there is one major news story that dominates the headlines\nAnd because of that other important stories I can get overlooked we dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving hay rides for to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he\nLeft his job this week as white\nHouse counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House down again is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney pets baloney\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while simple Loni is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nTo feel like as I'm listening to describe all of the some of this feels Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like we're hearing about one well connected guy taking over for the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that\nThat maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but ... says clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court in appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nSo what I Want to get back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed you did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation\nOr in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been handling much um the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that\nAs opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you though about the job itself didn't Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency or did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency\nBut if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins and maybe that's ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties\nIt's worth adding on that very important point that they are not creating divisions they are exacerbating divisions I already exist\nYet I mean you mentioned some of this is ... around gun control immigration neither cultural fishers Alice as a political reporter we got in the country we hear consistently from voters about these things but it sounds like you're saying they are just taking this and intensifying it in a in the social media space is\nAbsolutely and some of the documents reference and that these court charges from friday talk about witch hunts and making fun of Iraq Obama making fun of the late ... Arizona Senator John McCain targeting politicians on both sides of the aisle for some of these kinds of rhetoric we've been hearing in political ads here in the U.S overtime\nAnd even things like the NFL protesting the anthem protests\nAnd interesting if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show for NPR I must have a holiday and I'm here in Studio with NPR's Carrie Johnson Ryan Lucas and Phil Ewing still can sense as\nAnd now that we know that this is happening at least in the the information space and what the U.S officials are doing and is this something that we've been you think of the country successfully able to combat that's fine when we're talking about the administration response\nThe government says that it wants to make the public aware about this as much as possible the FBI has launched a special website That's focused on public information campaigns the director of national intelligence Dan Coats other people at his level talk about this publicly much more than they used to but the fact that are made clear in these court documents shows\nHow much this continues to take place on social media on Facebook and Twitter especially and frankly what a bad job those two platforms have done in scrapping these sorts of things\nThese court papers are filled with examples of Russian influence mongers creating fake accounts pretending to be Americans and posting means about president ... the former president his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are ostensibly or the coverage of the Austin bombings\nThat took place last year and how much\nThe media was ignoring them because the victims weren't white because they were black and Latino at the time and these as Ryan indicated are American controversy is taking place naturally in our own\nContext but the Russians are very skilled on social media and getting in there and trying to turn up the volume as much as they ...\nSome skill that there's actually some instructions quoted in these court papers in this part of this Russian Campaign they're telling Russians listen if you want to target American liberals don't mention the site Breitbart and if you want to target American conservatives steer clear of mentioning buzzfeed [laughter] I\nDon't know what they're doing [laughter] a little\nBit about what the social media platforms themselves they're doing with these tech giants are doing I knew our colleague Tim Mak did spend some time at Facebook just this past week and Facebook is sort of counting this election security war room that they've developed but I'm curious if any of you have a sense of\nHow successful they just because there's some degree also you know the Russians whoever it is is trying to interfere could extensively just invent new tricks\nWhat the platform so focused on his transparency so they're responding in the way that uh the American political system has historically a to campaign influence issues\nWhere if you buy an ad that says Obama is a part of the Muslim Brotherhood Facebook once you'd have to disclose who you are and thereby disclose the origins of that type of messaging so that will be in place for political campaigns going forward\nBut in real time when you're scrolling through your Facebook feed who's actually going to look at that and do the research and say oh this appears to be a foreign influence campaign if it's going to have an effect it's not going to stop the problem and it's not going to keep our information environment in the United states pristine in any way\nOn a slightly depressing that one of the questions that I always like to ask a\nCybersecurity people when I when I meet with him and talk to them is are these sorts of operations is this just the sort of world that we live in now and really there's no way to to and there's no way to combat those to the point where it's not going to be an issue and the depression answer that I generally get is this is pretty much the world we live enough\nTo constantly playing defense you can never really entirely fix the problem right you're just sort of trying to to blockade is that federal law goal is health and yeah that's a good example\nIs it's a dilemma that counterterrorism professionals have talked about for many years because we have an open society we have freedom of movement we have freedom of speech you can go wherever you want within reason and in the old days we worried about terrorists exploiting that these days we're worried about foreign governments exporting that because they can move\nIt's more quickly than Facebook and Twitter can to clamp down on them and I'm the U.S government really has no way to stop that from taking place\nI got to tell you that as somebody who sometimes goes out in the world to speak at places other than Washington DC\nI Know that we have listeners who teach high school and college history\nOr American studies or social studies\nAnd at the high school and the college level they are trying to educate people young people about how to recognize some of these phony means and information warfare attacks to try to get out the problem that way before\nPeople start logging into Facebook and believing what everything that they read there's actually a real kind of effort at civics\nEducation out they're aimed at young folks\nTo try to get them to recognize these things that are targeting them everywhere they go\nAnd that's a wonderful but it's also it's like a generational struggle that's it's going to take years and years to to get an educated voting populace that's conscious of such things\nJust to kind of wrap up the conversation here it sounds like the interference that we are seeing is is really just essentially on the information level the information and public space but it it's not really a matter of voting like if if I Am a vote or going to vote is not a real threat to election security in that way it is that right\nAccording to what these national security agency said on friday they haven't identified any cyber attack that is going to result in a vote being changed so if you go to the polls and you try to vote for your member of Congress what the government is saying if they don't have any evidence that that vote will not be counted as you intended\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think\nAs opposed to the actual way that votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you all so much thinking that you do All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race\nAs it was running for United States Senate this again and these are real never doubt fire and if we [noise] every\nWeek we focus on one race in the country then you get in a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey I'm here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez\nHe's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here do you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basic the who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about\nHis authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district ... took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide and geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given her talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave here this is the kind of seat that\nGoes in general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nShe'll healthcare has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing\nIn the New Jersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed\nThe current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nDo you still think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but\nI don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give ... trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nDo we have a sense of you know really the the real tangible side effects of this\nSo the idea is by not pursuing climate change your protective coal jobs even if you don't bring them all back but then there's also this idea that if you make energy more expensive\nThen people will have to pay more companies that rely on a lot using a lot of energy will have to Jack up their prices and so like what did you hear about the terrorists that and they raise prices on consumer it's basically the same thing that you'll raise prices on consumers and therefore consumers will have to pass well yeah it's just an\nInteresting thing though because I mean really what this is is it's it's a debate about I mean for sure if we were to address climate change tomorrow right let's just say that the Trump Administration somehow woke up tomorrow and said hey we actually think climate change Israel we want to do something about it in the short term for sure there would be job loss or be economic loss just because\nYou know that would require a complete change your market the way things work but\nWhen you look at the the implications of not doing anything I mean\nIt's hard to put a number on the future right it's hard to know exactly what the effects of climate change you're going to be and how much it would cost but I mean the the research it has come out of saying it's going to cost trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars parts of the country to parts of the world are going to be unlivable right so there are some really big issues\nThat you're you're just kind of kicking down the road and at some point somebody's gonna have to pay that cost if we're not paying it right now\nSo let's talk a little bit about what it specifically at stake in the midterms right if Republicans keep Congress do we get a sense that anything would change would things be kind of acts but I did that we've seen in terms of the Trump administration's um rejection of climate change into\nI mean yeah a lot of what you've seen right if you think about the Obama administration if you think about the Trump Administration is doing right now in terms of environmental policy almost everything that's happening is in the executive branch right in Congress has not they're not really doing anything to have it for a long time when it comes to the environment\nToday on the flip side than if Democrats are who do seem to see this as a pressing issue right now right politically\nYou are hearing Democrats talk a little bit more about climate change and some of the threats they hear from the Republican opponent so if Democrats were to take control even if one chamber of the house I mean what could they do too I mean beyond say oversight\nThat's about it every Democrat I talked to said oversight oversight oversight which you know we shouldn't be what does that mean exactly are you hearing you know expect to see Ryan Zinke key uh Andrew wheeler the head of the EPA\nRent it could be in the head of the interior um you know you would expect to see those guys on in hearings over and over and over again whether they'd be having to come up and explain a lot of the robots that they're doing explain why they've got rid of the mess and ruled explain you know the spending cuts for climate science at NASA\nOr those sort of things where it makes it very difficult for them do their jobs because they're basically I spent all their time preparing for hearings took a potentially slow down the process you're saying\nYeah could slow down the process you know there was another interesting thing that uh\nYou know Tom pile who is with the American energy alliance very supportive of Trump's agenda he said it would actually also give Democrats an environmental groups a stage to craft a narrative that that hasn't really gotten out there right now against what Trump is doing with the environment\nWhich I thought was really interesting you said there's just so much other news happening that environment issues really haven't you know taken center stage um and it would give them an opportunity to actually really to craft that narrative and put it out there\nThat's basically what the Republicans did on climate change under President Obama and they took over the house they would", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Story Board", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
