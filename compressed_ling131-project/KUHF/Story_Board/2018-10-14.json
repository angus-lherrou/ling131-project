Republican strategist Ken Spain who was the communications director for the ... the arm that gets ... tries to get Republicans elected to the house and he said look Republicans have been suffering from an intensity deficit over the course of the last few months and raising the threat level will hopefully translate to generating greater turnout\nAnd he said this really has to do with those red states like Texas in Tennessee\nFor the Senate to try to maintain the Senate because this fires up Republicans\nThat was NPR's to ... this is the politics show from NPR and we are talking to diminish go Ayesha Rascoe and Kelsey Snell Kelsey\nAnd that's precisely what McConnell said when I talked to him he said that this is coming at the perfect time that is coming on the eve of the election and when I asked him to predict how many Republicans were going to be in the Senate next year he declined to give me an actual number but what he said to me was that\nVoters are going to know that the Supreme Court fight underscores\nFor Republican voters that the Senate is what he called in the personnel business\nAnd that the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years for President Trump is Republicans lose\nDemocrats reacting to all of this\nDemocrats haven't been really able to come up with them clear message and to frame the message in a way that people could relate to to to say that this is what we're fighting for this is what we're concerned about this is why people are out there screaming or why people were out there who why people may be so passionate\nThat they haven't been really able to articulate that\nWell and we saw the former attorney general Eric Holder who's been involved in these midterms\nGo out and say show who says and you don't when they go low [noise]\nThey go low we do\nThat for all kinds of outrage\nOn the right uh you know people going after him saying he was spring on violence\nAnd he said they should stop the fake outrage but certainly feeling them\nAnd it it seems like of this moment people are tired when you talk about civility when you talk about uh going high they're saying that didn't work for us and they're saying that the other side has not done that so they would argue that the Republicans have not gone high that the Tea Party was not polite\nThat President Trump is not civil and he's he's not always polite and he says a lot of things are so why shouldn't they fight fire with fire\nWill also when I talked to activists up here a couple of them said to me that there don't see a point in being polite when they feel like they're ... they're very real risks to some of their core beliefs in the political system right now and then when ...\nWhen President Obama was being polite it was when he was in power and that there's just simply a difference here that knew that Democrats feel that they have no power in the situation and their visceral reaction is coming from that place of of fear\nAnd frankly the frustration on the part of Democrats you know President Obama thought that he could get a lot of things done with Republicans in a good faith negotiating way and it just didn't happen\nThat was NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Kelsey Snell and medical ... thanks everyone thank you thank you\nAnd Dominican stick with it now it's time for racial ...\nGetting fifty seven fifty dollar ... we will never dies down fight and if we buy [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all over the place this week we're looking at Minnesota's\nEighth congressional district Dominican oh you're still with us and I want to bring in mark the deck like of Minnesota Public radio hey mark thanks for joining us\nIt's my pleasure I'm a big fan of the show thanks for having me\nOff thank you so mark what's it been like they're on the ground\nWell Minnesota's just a hot bed of political activity this year and not just in the eighth district remember Senator Al Franken he resigned in January his seat needs to be filled in a special election a Minnesota senator and recall the shark is up for her regular reelection Minnesota\nChoosing a new governor and three new members of Congress were really busy over here\nYou know the sixty eight competitive districts that the cook Political Report says either lean to one party or as a toss up only three of those are democratic held seats in Minnesota there are two of those seats and one of them is what we're talking about here today\nSo again we're looking at the eighth congressional district in Minnesota ... who is in this race well\nThis is an open seat that's because the Democrat Rick Nolan who's the congressman holds the seat is not running for reelection in Minnesota the Democratic party is referred to as the Democratic farmer labor party and that candidate\nIs Joe ... he's a former state representative he's thirty two years old or the Republican candidate is Pete Stauber he's a St Louis county commissioner\nHe's a retired Duluth, Minnesota police officer and there's an independent in this race too so how he's going to shape this race is going to be interesting his name is ray sandman people call him skipped\nSo this is a district where in sort of an unusual thing\nFor twenty Eighteen Republicans are on off right and if Democrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to net to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if they want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years to have a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points in the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest wing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd to the demographics\nTell a lot of that story they do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August ... at a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play mining\nIs a big issue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the race if Independence Party candidates you love support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat\nBoth read that ... been talking also a lot about taking back our government here as a Democrat ... recent debate\nWay to wrestle control from the special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people in rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race ... like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare ... says that's a bad idea here is we're done if it's going after a stop her on the issue at that same debate\nMy opponent ... two minutes now to talk about health care that's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage for more Americans\nThat caught up with stop or in the southern end of the district north of the twin cities recently he's also trying to frame or done of it is a political opportunity someone who moved from Minneapolis back up north to get into the race\nI've got fifty two years of of life on this earth and I I've spent the vast majority of my life outside politics [noise] my opponent has been in politics\nHearing from voters you're out there\nWell people are engaged Democrats and Republicans both claimed that they have the most voter enthusiasm behind them as the election draws near\nA Democrats are saying some people who voted for Donald Trump buyer's remorse and they're looking now to try to cast a vote against Trump in the mid term elections in support people like a ...\nRepublicans oh say they're equally fired up and they're saying as we've been hearing a lot all week that's a battle over Brett Kavanaugh has really really fired up\nTheir base and they think that that is going to be enough at least in northern Minnesota to flip a district from democratic and Republican control\nWell I'm Mark thank you for joining us absolutely my pleasure thanks for having me and NPR's America ... thank you do You're welcome\n[noise]\n\n\nThis\nIs the politics show from NPR we'll be right back [noise] everybody's talking about politics but who's listening we are\nWe're listening to candidates local leaders activist and voters will choose the direction our country said was the next two years I Jonathan Capehart joined me for a national conversation from WNYC about the mid term elections America on the line we're all in this together [noise]\nIt's not like you know it's made easy you know we vote on\nTuesdays ... which was designed for an agrarian society you know in November So this has not been updated and we definitely have one party that has more of a sense of urgency\nTo go and make these changes to make it easier to vote because a lot of these voters have been talking about our core key democratic\nGroup here right to make and there's one other group actually I really wanted us to talk about and to your intimate go they also tend to lean more democratic and those are folks have color in particular Latino and Asian Americans have really low voter participation rate there even lower in mid term election years\nAnd ironically the two fastest growing groups in the country by ...\nExactly and and and so you hear this time and again and you can even go to places you know this election cycle people have talked to a lot about Beto O'Rourke who is challenging Ted Cruz in Texas for the for the Senate\nAnd and what that could mean and we have one of our colleagues who also went down and spend some time in El Paso\nThat is where ... is from and and she met people who didn't know better was\nDidn't really know who's running for office and it just felt like they didn't put their face in politics because they felt like they've never banked on political institutions changing their lives and there's one woman in particular who made this point uh her name is Christina Rodriguez she was in El Paso but I\nReally don't think about it I kind of sad to say but I don't think about like okay well what can be better and it's like I Do it I can do to make my life I don't depend on them to change things for me\nThat's an amazing quote there is this sense of powerlessness that I met from a lot of people that they don't feel like things have changed so therefore whoever's in office you know they're just sort of moving along because they don't notice a change from President to president\nAnd the races that could make the biggest difference in your life like maybe city council or school board or or the state legislature\nThose are the sexy races they everybody talks about those are the ones where it's really hard to get information about who the candidates are and that and that leaves people feeling like they they don't know who to vote for\nAnd it's a huge issue in the southwest in particular I mean you look at Texas\nArizona we were talking about Nevada where you have this huge surge of Latinos and yet or not registered to vote so every time you hear people talking about how Democrats could turn Texas blue for example\nThat is really reliant on Democrats being able to not just get Latinos to vote but get Latinos registered to vote and then be fired up to vote for them and in fact there's actually a growing gap\nAh that's been seen between the number of eligible Latino voters versus the number of Latino voters who've cast a ballot over the years\nSo what would happen if all these non voters showed up on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November\nWell first of all they might not be able to vote because you have to be registered before the deadline so people need to go look that up if you're if you're considering it and many of those deadlines with his hat either way or passed right but if that were to happen [noise] hey\nOr polls would probably be a lot more accurate because we have a better sense an ability to to map out by demographics how people would likely vote\nOr it would certainly changed the shape of not just the races in this country but I think ... has been making the point about public policy as well that was NPR's off a holiday and the minute come on to narrow things much guys who are welcome [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and it feels like there are only stories that we just can't get too\nBecause there's so much other political news so every week we take a few minutes to dig in on some of those headlines that you may have missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving however I tell her time\nSo let's start with spying the Justice Department unsealed charges this week against suspected Chinese spies for allegedly conducting espionage fill us in\nOkay we're not talking about the usual kinds of cloak and dagger military spying here this is about high tech competition between major economies so\nAnd the U.S government allege\nThe individual in question the Chinese individual posed as an official of a tech association but was in fact when official in Chinese intelligence\nAnd he invited a GE engineer to visit China stayed in touch tried to get specific proprietary information and so he was arrested in Brussels my Belgian authorities and has been extradited to the United states to face trial\nUp but this could be a big deal because even though it's economic as we say it's the first time someone believed to be in Chinese intelligence\nHas been brought to the United states to stand trial\nOK moving on the environmental protection agency has taken some new actions to weaken regulations is that right Ron\nThis was the week with the United nations came out with that big report giving the world's governments essentially a decade to get serious about climate change before it's too late that got a certain amount of attention but not so much attention has gone to some of the individual things the EPA has been deciding\nAre having to do with various kinds of pollution and this particular week of the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come in a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals are weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and\nOur last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions from oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back\nSome of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty votes not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of\nAbsolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap and so they said why just three months or let's let 'em go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations were made in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nAnd that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other news is happening\nThank you run again\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back\nI'm even though ... on the next freakonomics radio one of the men who helped rebuild New York city after nine eleven now helping build the city of
