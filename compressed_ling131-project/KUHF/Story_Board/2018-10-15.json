suddenly flew to Brussels raising hopes that deal within sight\nBut afterwards you negotiator Michel ... said despite intense effort some key issues are still open would a hard border\nA group of people who were in control of the nation's economy and its political system began to define democracy in such a way that they said you know\nWhat democracy really means is that a few of us people of wealth and power and education and people who are well connected who know people in Europe as well as in all the big cities we're really the ones who should be running this country because we are really the only ones who understand well how to run the economy\nAnd how to order people's work styles in such a way that\nThey're going to produce the best that they can for this country and they still call that democracy but there was this idea that a few people really were better than others\nThe nation was not one of equals but rather that a few people should rule over everybody else and in the Eighteen fifty is in the Eighteen nineties that crisis of democracy the idea that democracy really meant a few people should run things no matter what the word itself originally meant\nLed to a series of laws so that more and more privileges went up to those people at the top of the economy in of the social scale and the political scale\nBut interestingly enough in the Eighteen nineties and in the Eighteen fifty is even though in the case of the Eighteen fifty if those people were so determined to control America that when they lost control of the government they in fact tried to create their own nation the Confederate States of America\nIn each of those periods that version of democracy lost and the reason why it lost and the way it lost is why I studied democracy and why a study American politics and what makes me wake up every morning and want to know more about this country and how it's government works\nYou know it's interesting you're talking about the Confederate States of America sometimes that's portrayed a move that government is portrayed as an alternative form of democracy if you look at it no it wasn't it wasn't democracy at all\nWell people forget that Alexander Stevens and many of the other people who were talking about what the confederacy met an Alexander Stevens was from George aims leader from Georgia and he goes on to become the vice president of the confederacy [noise]\nHe gave a speech right before the war in which he talked about the cornerstone of Confederate States of America and he's talking about slavery but people tend to forget in that cornerstone speech even though he talks a lot about how the new nation is going to be based in slavery he goes on to critique the founders\nAnd what he says is that the founders were wrong they made the mistake of thinking that every man with equal when in fact the confederacy had figured it out for real they had advanced beyond the founders he says and the cornerstone speech\nThey had gone on to create a nation which acknowledge that some people were better than others and this was the foundation on which the confederacy what's going to be belt and he goes on in that speech just said this is the revolution that's going to take over the world\nPretty soon everybody is going to be forming their governments on this concept\nThat a few of us are really\nDesigned to run the world for everybody else and that piece of the confederacy that piece of the idea that democracy really should be refined so a few people run things is one of the channels that runs through American history from the very beginning and rises up sometimes more than others\nAnd is perhaps rising up again right now and is one of the things that we have to come to grips with in our present moment\nThere's a critical phrase in our constitution a more perfect union which seems to encompass the understanding that we can and should do better and there's sort of this illusion in our as we see our past that it is a steady art that we've ...\nSounds in years one of the major differences between the ancient models in the U.S constitution and just democracy mandate a trade off between equality and liberty\nFor answers to those and many other questions we turn to class assistant political scientist Daniel Allen the James Bryant ... university professor that's Conan ... with the tea and director of the Edmond J suffer a Center for ethics at Harvard she's the author of among others why Pluto wrote the world is for me the assembly brilliantly reviewed\nOur declaration a reading of the declaration of independence in defense of the quality she joined us from her office at Harvard welcome to the program\nThanks so much for having me and let's begin with the basic question in fact the question that's the title of this episode why democracy\nHuman beings love liberty we all know that and that love of liberty is a desire to shape our own lives to shape the direction and our choices\nWere those impulses you just described where they behind the decision of the Athenians to adopt democracy\nWell the impulses I just described a human decision or human impulses rather so I think in all honesty that you can see them underneath all kinds of human political decisions yes they played a role in ancient Athens the story of ancient Athens is really one that begins with conflict between the rich and the poor\nAnd with a judicious decision of a man named sol on to begin to shape institution in ways that permitted both rich and poor the chance to develop shared directions for the city\nWell is it fair to say then Danielle but with all the other kinds of governments that there were in the city states in ancient Greece see the monarchies tyranny and see oligarchy solve all the various types that Athens one successful because it adopted a form of democracy\nAthens democracy definitely brought it special success\nThe secret that Athens had was that they organize their institutions to really mixed the different parts of the population up\nSo they use their political institutions to bring urban Athenians rural Athenians and if he needs on the coast to gather 'em in slightly sort of randomized ways to make decisions what this did\nWas turned Athens into an incredible knowledge generating machine you can think of it as and that meant they were incredibly innovative they developed a powerful economy it gave them military power\nAnd that view has been as much a part of democratic life in history as a view that thinks that once you're committed to democracy you have to spread it everywhere\nWell that does bring us to a good point to bring this back to America there's a quite a leap from ancient Athens and room and American democracy in the Seventeen hundreds what drove the framers toward representative democracy in their time\nDid have some other models the Venetian and Florentine republics had continued through much of that period for example so it wasn't disrupt straight from antiquity up until the present but the other thing that was really important was that over the course of the sixteen hundred\nSeventeen hundreds enlightenment philosophers had really been articulating the value of liberty and equality to human flourishing\nAnd as they had articulated that value sort of talked about how it is that a human life grows in healthy ways on the basis of those values those philosophers had also been trying to articulate\nViews about legal institution that would make it easier to make liberty and equality real things so for example the French philosopher a month to skip\nInnovated with this remarkable idea that you can actually separate the different kinds of powers of government executive power judicial power legislative power\nThat was a kind of rural changing innovation because once you could see that bits of different kinds of power could he pulled apart from each other\nYou actually have them some institutional wave of limiting the power of government and suddenly voila wow you know sort of prospects for freedom and equality emerged from that discovery\nDid the men and women who fought the American revolution of course they have the the declaration of independence but did they understand that they were going to emerge with some sort of representative democracy or some democracy in some form\nThey were just having huge debates about this question I think the thing I Love about the founding period is how hard everybody was thinking about how to design political institutions to yield liberty and equality so there was no pre given answer they had to figure it out\nAnd you see different experiments all through the colonies to for example Pennsylvania's first constitution was a direct democracy and in fact there was a huge contingent of people who are arguing for that\nAnd then other holidays most immediately developed for themselves more representative forms so they had this terrific natural experiment where they could try to treat the design this way or that way and different colonies and then figure out which design actually works better for governance\nIt's also worth reminding people that there was a system of government before the constitution we have now the articles of confederation which were much more focused on democracy than the constitution later was do you want to deal with that a little bit then yeah\nBut I think that's another interesting feature of our political history is that at that period of the revolution in fact for example even voting rights were more broadly distributed so women could vote in New Jersey for example in the early years of the republic\nAnd it was actually in the period of Seventeen eighties in Seventy nine to use that we see some restrictions and we get to a place where it's the basic model if the property owning white male um who's the voter\nSo yes the Democratic element in the balance was stronger in the first phase of the founding it's still strong when we get to the constitution and we have to recognize that the constitutional convention and the result is a compromise between those who are more democratically inclined\nAnd those who are more inclined to sort of Republican are aristocratic political forums\nTo for example the fact that we got the house of representatives with direct proportional representation reflected the view of James Wilson uh one of the founders who thought that the new country rested on the authority of a single national United people and it was really focus on that democratic conception\nAnd then you had other voices at the constitutional convention who really thought what they were up to was just sort of drawing up a treaty among different states and that's where you get the Senate from from that idea\nAnd they were the folks who tended to be more oriented towards aristocratic political forums so you know we have this hybrid model that has competing impulses woven into it\nSo I guess the other thing I Would say there is just that to the degree that people want to think of as a single answer to what the country was when we were founded it's just sort of wrong there's overlapping consensus\nWhich means that ultimately people signed onto a single instrument the constitution but they did so for different reasons and they each could count different moments of victory within what they had developed because they actually had very different things they were trying to do so a genuine originalism would recognize the pluralism of commitments in our founding\nI was going to say just that the constitution and the American democracy really is as George Washington said a great experiment that we are still engaged in figuring out\nThat's right and Washington also sat in his farewell address that one of the most important facts of that experiment was the decision to commit to a union\nWhich then of course was reaffirmed by Lincoln embattled lesson that we actually have lost sight of if we can understand the value of union we don't understand the value of democracy because a democracy at the end of the day has to be a forum where you lose out in a political moment and you stay in the game anyway\nWe're talking with classes assistant political philosopher Daniel Allen to Harvard where she is the James Brian Conan university professor and director of the Edmond J Safr Center for ethics after a break we'll ask her about how democracy works and doesn't\nYou can find out more about the democracy test at our website which is truth politics and power dot org where you can also dip
