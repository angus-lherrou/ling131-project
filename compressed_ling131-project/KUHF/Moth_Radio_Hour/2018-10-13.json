I don't see chair and lioness who had the shots were he was kind of pale and he was in the baby swing and he was swimming in the dark in the living room\nI could kind of see him through the arch way and the darkness and he just felt like he was on the other side of a divide he felt like he was swinging away from me and I got this just horrible pit of the stomach feeling I was like you know that doctor\nAnd so I I called her back you know the next day and I was like listen I really want to get him checked out she's like All right we'll get his eyes checks before we started doing neurological testing so I made an appointment with an eye doctor\nAnd this was the winter and all of a sudden New York city was hit with this terrible blizzard was two thousand and three December fish\nAnd the whole city was just like Snowden with this horrible blizzard in here I was I was going to take this three month old baby in on the subway in a blizzard because I had a bad feeling but I went ahead and I I did it and I got to the doctor's office and they dilated his pupils and the doctor got very very quiet\nAnd he disappeared into the back room and he came back\nA business card for um a man named Dr Abramson who was the world's leading specialist um in retinal blessed I'm a very rare kind of cancer\nAnd he said your son has a massive tumor on his retina of his right eye and you need to go get a treat it right away and a week later we had started chemotherapy\nI never knew a child so young could even get cancer I never heard of anything like this and so my husband and I went into like straightforward that'll mode it's like we were going to take care of this we were going to be in control we were going to do everything that we could we went to Sloan Kettering every three weeks they would gas him they would examine his eyes they would find a new tumor\nWe go back three more weeks they Ghassan they'd examined is either find another two or three tumors it was\nUltimately Thirteen tumors and all\nAnd I kept looking for answers as like what could cause something like this I Would ask the doctors it's like you know what caused this and it's like nothing cause that it's a random mutation\nBut I couldn't believe that it's like clearly it wasn't my son ... he was three months old you know in smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and then lying in the tanning bed you know something must have caused this and it must be me\nBecause I was his mother and it was my job to protect him and I had failed at the ... won the job at a mother is given which was to protect\nMy son and it was about this time that the dirty diapers started\nWhen my daughter was little we had this beautiful house and Clinton hill and had had a front porch and one morning when my daughter was maybe seven or eight months old I come out and I just almost tripped over this like dirty diaper that was sort of rolled up on the welcome mat\nAnd I I was like ... you know some random piece of garbage it's Brooklyn so I picked it up and I do it in the trash I didn't think anything more of it in a couple of days later it came out and there was another dirty diaper that was right on the welcome mat and I'm like Mm this doesn't feel so random anymore\nAnd maybe another week would go by and another dirty diaper and I couldn't figure out where they were coming from and who I made an enemy of and and then I remembered that our babysitter gotten into some like turf war with another baby sitter on the playground and it was like this is the language I don't even speak I'm not going to get stressed out about it\nBut now it came when my son was sick and I walked out with the double stroller and I almost tripped over another dirty diaper again and this time I just\nKind of lost my job is and I was like who is out to get my family\nI and and the dirty diapers kept coming\nAnd I couldn't figure out who was and about the same time my daughter who was three years old started to get weird on me too and she wouldn't go into the boys bedroom and she is and and every time she'd go into the boys bedroom she would point out the closet and she started crying and she's like\nA bad no live there are bad enough to live there and now with her three year old word for bird and she's like there is a bad\nBird that lives in the closet and so I'm for you know it's like there's you know like diapers coming or the bad bird that lives in the closet my son has cancer so I did what any rational mother would do [laughter] I went to Chinatown and I bought this enormous\nDragon that was so big I seen it in a store and I thought this somehow will protect my children because of fears looking mother and dragon [noise] and it's like they should scare the black furtive a closet right so I dragon over the crib\nUm and the next day I Walk into the boys bedroom\nAnd the ... right I have that dragon is on the floor\nEllis says to me she's like the not picked it out and I'm like\nGrip on yourself got hot glue gun I bet\nI I you know I went to bed the next night\nElla come screaming in her bedroom with adult that she has it should be given for Christmas and she's like my dog isn't it might be missing and the right eye apart\nDoll was gone and my husband who was not superstitious at all even he was freaking out at this point and he went under her bed and he found the right eye of the dollar was under her bed and so by this time I'm like I'm reaching out to anybody I reached out to a neighbor who was very well versed in the art center area\nAs low as somebody is headed for you you have definitely been cursed and you need to get a priest in here and exercise this house and you need to sleep a Bible in the window of the boys\nBedroom but I'm rational and now like I'm not going to go to some punk ass but can attend park slope runs mistreated like I'm going to go to the Sloan Kettering botanical as\nDo I get on the number to train and I go straight to Flatbush\nI'm walking around like looking for I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for but it's like a climate Metallica and it's like love lotions\nAnd money powders and you know the scandals of the ... that are masquerading as Catholic saints and I walk in there and there's this guy that sitting behind a wall\nWell let proof glass like it's a liquor store and just got out of\nIt as like blue white eyes that were out he was ... he was like eating a from a Styrofoam bowl of couple of noodles\nRice with like ... noodles and I walk into [laughter]\nI Walk in and I'm like I'm\nExcuse me I'm someone is put a curse on my house and my family\nAnd I need something to fight back\nAnd he kind of not not that the show is\nLike down below and it's all these brown bottles of something called ... and I look at\nWash it's like I don't it's like what do you think for some it's like [noise] and so I I turn back time I was like no no no I don't think you understand somebody is waging\nSupernatural warfare on my family and you're trying to sell me floor I Need something that will somebody\nYou know me and he sort of leans\nIn and I come up to the bullet proof glass is all scratched up\nAnd he says to me he's like\nLady if somebody's trying to put a person you want to go home and figure out what you did to deserve it\nI paid for the la mama\nAnd he hit it exactly on the nose because he'd spoken to me my sack fear what had I done to deserve it and not what I had done to deserve my own bad luck but what had I done to bring down an innocent baby\nAnd I went home\nBumble all over my front porch and I'm like mom being in the middle of the night it's like stripping the paying off my porch\nAnd thinking about the stories that we tell ourselves and how random everything is and how random\nComes for innocent children\nEvery day all over the world and earlier I connected the dots and I told myself a story that saved his life he got into the hospital and it got him treatment at a time when he could have died\nAnd then later on in all the agony and the fear and despair and the guilt I told myself another story and I connected the dots in another way that made me to blame and I got two appointed mob and that\nWas like why\nDo we tell ourselves these stories and why does so many of her story slip into those stories\nAnd I realized the only control I had over the situation my own personal San trivia was to let go of his story that I needed to tell myself and live more like Emily had said in our town to realize life every every minute\nAnd when I woke up the next morning it was like a\nAnd beautiful and clear winter day and Ella started talking about the black bird and I'm like let's go to the playground and we went outside and it was a beautiful day and I said you know what\nWell I went into a military precision mode I started by\nGetting a car and driver in Bangkok where we're going to me I mean the way she put it let's why not ... let's just meet in Bangkok is if well you know to people who knew each other vaguely would go to the oriental hotel and have tea you know\nBut I knew this was serious for her and so I Want to make everything just right but the timing was a crucial element because this is a woman who hadn't had in the years I had known her ten dollars in her purse I mean the same ten dollars at one time\nAnd I do if she managed somehow to buy this ticket to Bangkok\nThat she was going to arrive broke and so I had to be there and so I'm not planning on time was meticulous I figured out how long would take I had one day for every movement every time I had to change planes every time I had to walk across the street we add a day I'm going to get their forties early as my target as four days early and then I Do it in another three days [noise]\nLook I'm playing for my life here [noise]\nAh so ah\nAnd then very quickly you know we're getting into the the middle of October and the uh the fellow who's relating may has reported for duty and I've signed over the equipment weapons to him a we've shaken hands it's essentially done and I don't get out the door quite fast enough with a message comes in and says one of our post\nOr on the lotion border has come under siege and we have to go do our part to save them\nOr I could have left but in truth ... none of none of my guys expected me to because the new guy didn't even know everyone's name yet and you can't really expect in March off to war or when he's just hey you sort of sort of relationships so I put down my pack bags and went back to the war\nUm we went up to the camp or it was an ugly bit of business or they were being shelled by heavy mortars and artillery um and we push back the foreign observers the eyes and ears of the artillery and then we went after the guns themselves and eventually it was all over\nAnd I had a day left um but I rushed to an airplane um without being manifest against the rules and got down to Saigon and I had one day\nTo find a way to Bangkok I was five days till the next commercial flights when across and three days until the embassy courier flight went to Bangkok and at the end of a long and very frustrating day arguably the darkest day of my life\nA guy said captain you can't get there by the twenty eighth even if you hijacking airplanes [noise]\nI felt like I couldn't worries\nI felt like I had somehow been hit with something and so I went to the special forces club [noise] the bar there or was open seven days a week twenty four hours a day for eight years\nAnd I went there and I had a lot of money in my genes I was you know and so I drank good scotch and after three after three scotch as generously port up it came to me I could fix this I was going to drink myself to death in that bar\nI told myself you're not leaving here until they carry you out dead\nAnd just as I started into that mode in through the door comes Martha Ray Maggie re the patron saint of the Green Berets now some of you may not know who Martha Ray is or was um [noise] she was born in Nineteen sixty or\nBy Nineteen Twenty one she was a headliner in vaudeville she made her first movie in Nineteen thirty four made thirty more them or three times with Bob Hope but my favorite movie most ... do\nA she played with Charlie Chaplin she acted him right off the screen through the entire movie and he was the director and producer so Megan came in and she and I had known each other since the beginning of that second tour might\nAnd and we had a good relationship we had shared common interest we'd like good coffee and vodka and movies and we spend a lot of time talking about that well she walked in surveyed her domain there I'm Maggie a you know had been there six months a year for seven years\nAnd it wasn't that do shows and it wasn't to promote herself or her career or anything she just came and largely just hung around with the guys with the Green Berets she was our cheerleader she was our confidant\nWell she walked in as I say she surveyed heard domain and then she looked at me and she sat down in order to drink and gave me a huge stage frown tap my hand and said Larry what's wrong\nI said maybe I just I screwed up my whole life there's one girl she's going to be in Bangkok I'm not going to be able to get there I don't know what I'm gonna do I I'm just ruined everything are just completely follow this whole thing up\nAnd I said she's going to arrive in Bangkok she's going to be broke she's gonna wait a day maybe two and then she's going to have to go home\n\nMaggie thought about it for a minute he's she said Larry are you sure that this girl is that important 'cause there are an awful lot of ways to have fun in this world without you know just invent yourself all over again I said no baggage she's absolutely the girl I Want the girl I Need the girl I Want to marry that this is this is everything she's it\nAnd she gave me another pause and then she said we'll fix this we're going to go tomorrow and see the head of the seventh Airforce it's a four star general and we're going to fix this will get you a ride you get in Bangkok on time\nAnd so I went to the to my room and woke up and ten minutes later the adrenaline in mid burned off all the hangover and I was ready for the day and I marched out to uh to uh meet Maggie and off we went to see the head of the seventh Airforce\nWe walked into the building at ... airfield that said headquarters seventh Airforce through that\nFor and there are signs that say executive suites this direction maybe understood that the real head of the seven third force was not the four star general who got in the pictures it was a senior noncommissioned officer who really ran the place command master sergeant\nFrancis Patrick my honey not Mahoney dear God no ma hundred [noise]\nAnd so [noise]\nMy honey operates in a huge bay of pigs eats a lot of people doing busy and important work in a sort of Plexiglas cube\nThat's his office so he can see in every direction and I'm left to sit outside Maggie is received like royalty inside and she her just ... get Wilder and while there's he's pointing over her shoulder may\nBut my honeys head is slowly turning this way and what was it smiles turned to a oh my God [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAnd the issue is in real doubt I can tell because Maggie cries OK Maggie only cried on cue [noise]\nShe's she's pulled out all the stops soda any rate this goes on for some time I'm visiting trying to look professional fidgety\nI'm and I'm finally called in and he looks at me like I was something that dog drug in and said captain we'd be glad to give you a hand with this problem be a chalk one or two at midnight tonight and we'll get you to Bangkok on time\nWell I must have given him sick days six thank you very much as I ran out to sea chalk one or two a structure circle underground with a number painted on it it's a meeting place I rushed back to my room packed my begging with a flashlight I Wonder what went on to a very dark\nVery dimly lit ... air force base\nI was having a a you know some questions about which way to turn when it when I got to the headquarters to get there but then I saw there was a light shining and that seemed to be about the right direction so I walked to the light that light was right over chalk one oh too\nIt's in a war zone run an airbase it's dark everywhere except where I'm standing I felt like Bogart in ... Blanca\nBut along comes a major right at the crack admitted that grabs my armies as your career I said Yes sir\nAnd we went to the generals Learjet\nThere's only Jenna colonel flying generals personal pilot does this major is the co pilot and there is a senior enlisted guy in the back who's a crew chief and occasional steward and moments later we're moving towards altitude and the generals plane I'm leaning back drinking some of the generals booths\n[noise]\nNow the surreal is part of the actual fabric of war you see it everywhere and I was a I was at the end of any ability to generate any disbelief about anything but this was strange even for a Vietnam and Maggie's mojo was sensational\nSo I ... I got my way to Bangkok I had enough time for a few hours sleep to get nice and clean and ... and go to the airport\nTo meet this woman\n[noise] it was a big green room hospital green cement blocks it's a palace now that airport but then it was very basic\nAnd the the gates emptied into the hall from from a distance and all of us waiting to see people were kept behind the lines at some distance off so I I'm peering very carefully to see her and for reasons that she's never been able to justify she's about the last person off the train", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
