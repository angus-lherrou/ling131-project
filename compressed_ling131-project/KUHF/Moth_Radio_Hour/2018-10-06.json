misunderstanding\nBy the time I got back to campus on Monday things had really escalated um and as a as I said nobody knew who I was so nobody can vouch for me so I write a follow up editorial I'm for the paper that said hello I'm black sorry [noise]\nBut the paper the paper only printed once a week every Thursday and we didn't know that you could just put anything online anytime you want it to three literally didn't know how the Internet work [noise]\nSocialism bad\nThe black student union which I was not a member a [noise]\nDecided to hold a town hall um to talk about the whole thing and I decided to go [noise]\nIt's mainly just well these are my people right this was about the sign\nAt the end of the day to find that was on campus that we have to walk by all the time just for the community issue and so I I was going to go and be a part of the community\nSo I Walk into this huge lecture hall hundreds of people in their most it's a diverse crowd but most of the faces\nAnd there are are black like my um and uh I stayed in the back\nUp and I'm not quite sure why but somebody has told me to hold back um [noise]\nBecause I mean history it varies I don't know me but there is never been a room and I walked in that has a microphone in it including this room that I haven't wanted to get up and start talking to my [noise]\nBut I didn't and I I watch a person to person walked up to the microphone and started talking about how angry they were at this white\nRacist names are airtime is\nPerson after person kept talking about how they were furious and hurt them to share the campus with this not see this white supremacist named our time is I was like I feel very attacks right now [noise]\nIt's very confusing everyone was talking about me and nobody was talking about this fine which was a part of what I wrote and I turned to the guy next to me tall light skinned black looking\nThis is really something isn't he was like yeah there are tons of sounds like a real [noise]\nGrammar is impeccable [noise]\nAnd it continued nobody was talking about the science everybody was talking about me\nAnd I started to get flushed and I started to get angry and I started to feel so isolated just like I felt in the store\nI didn't understand I wrote a joke I wrote a satire 'em and nobody was laughing and everyone was angry at me and I I I didn't understand why they didn't see that I'd done this for us\nUm so I left\nBecause I was frustrated um\nAnd I didn't know how to fix it I couldn't just mark up to the front and say\nBoy I caught [noise]\nI remember when I wrote I saw it big as a joke I wrote to make people laugh with me but the thing is what else was riding the bus home I realized what should've been playing the obvious which is that like I wasn't laughing and\nI hadn't written what I wrote to make people laugh I wrote what I wrote to make people angry because it signed hurt my feelings and in the book store and alone in that store face to face with that time the hurt ballooned into anger and I wanted more than anything not to be alone in that anger I wanted to know that I was\nI was not the only person met felt to sway the only person I felt\nOppressed by the fine\nI'm so widespread that anger accidentally to all these people ... through but I still felt alone and I still felt unseen and so I left them alone in that room whichever anger kind of amazing that will do to reach each other\nI published the second editorial that we can mix sort of wealth things although the black student union did feel the need to censure me a which is sort of like an official rebuke I I kind of felt like it should come up like a certificate but it does not\nAnd I received emails hate mail four months after that month so it was incredible I never heard anything about the sign though I never heard anything from the bookstore so they did take it down eventually and beginning of march because [noise]\n... was over [noise]\nYou can see a picture

[noise]\n\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought\nIn Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of\nPrinciples on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college\nMary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which is bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile doing all of\nThis I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and it's the U.S versus China\nWho are rooting for [noise]\nJoe ... of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nI couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause of Rochester right but I found my way\nTo figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was so excited to watch a PBS documentary about me becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last\nTwenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English\nAnd I felt totally paralyzed lost my own thoughts I Would just ruminate endlessly about tiny details and second guess any decision that I made it all\nSo during these rough patches I find myself I found myself kinda looking out the world for signs that you know things were going to be okay\nAnd the science included dramatic moments like when a rain both seem to frame the finish line of a marathon I was running or even just little daily moments like when you go down to the subway and the train arrives right if you get there and it stops with the doors centered right on you [noise]\nI found real comfort in these tiny moments\nBut when sort of during the point of rock bottom ness feeling this way I went out for a run one afternoon and made this sort of impulsive stop at the farm stand on my way home and bought a bag of spinach because one\nAnd this bag or spinach was huge it was like the size of the toddler really it has roots in rocks and dirt and sand and everything in it and it only cost a dollar\nFresh fresh produce in New York for a dollar I was delighted to lighted by the deal and lucky for me I actually only had a dollar I hadn't planned on going to chopping while running so I use that like really crusty emergency dollar bill that you probably have stuck in your shoes somewhere [noise]\nSo anyway about the spinach headed home and lay down on the couch to rest\nAnd online there my mind begins to wander and I'm thinking how am I going to eat all that spinach an awful lot of spinach always buy too much produce and always goes bad before I get a chance to cook it and it goes bad before I get a chance to cook it because I don't cook enough at home because I work late\nAnd produce is usually so expensive in New York you know that's been issued so cheap because it was so dirty\nAnd I can't even I Can't even wash it to make it more convenient to cook because they like if it gets damp it's just going to go bad faster and I can't wash it and drag 'cause I don't have a salad spinner of south dinner because I'm not married [noise]\n\nSingle I'm In my thirties admitted nine weddings in the last nine months and that's when you get all your kitchen lined up ... calories salads but I I've seen it all if I were married I Would have that stuff but\nI live in New York now in kitchens are so small here where we put all that stuff I might can we've already blocked my biggest cabinet do they even make smaller versions of these things how am I going to eat all that spinach [noise]\nEventually I fall asleep this been cycle finally quieted by dreams\nAnd when I wake up hustle out of the house then meeting some friends for a movie and if I'm crossing the street you know how in New York people be things that they don't really want on the curb like an old mattress or a stack of books or like a gap blazer from the late nineties [noise]\nI'm crossing the street and you'll never\nGuess what is sitting on a student actually sort of a stone wall across the street from me\nA miniature settled spinner [noise]\nI'm not kidding a salad spinner for one [noise]\nIt's sitting all by itself\nNot around other things not part of an impending trash collection it's sitting on a clean while across the street from me on this random Saturday just waiting for me [noise]\nAnd I see it and I you know I've never I've never even seen as many thousand or before I didn't I didn't\nKnow if they made these things and it's tiny it fits in the palm of my hand I mean it's it's actually really adorable\nUpon seeing things free things on the curb a younger version of me would be like oh that mattress look so comfortable like this blazer fit me but having lived in New York for a couple of years now I'm more like bedbugs and now you're in there [laughter]\nSo as I finally train myself to do I acknowledge this amazing salad spinner and just walk on\nAnd I get to the end of the block and I stopped cold in my tracks because my stomach is on fire and I'm like W. E. T. F. that\nThat's my salad spinner\nTurn around I raised back up the black rabbit ... been a running back to my apartment straight to the bathroom throat in the bathtub drawback squirt dish washing detergent generously all over it and I'd like to take that you'll\n[laughter] I'm an ex\nMorning the next morning I wake and I clean the salad spinner off in earnest and I'm you know retrieving it from the bath tub and I'm sort of marveling at its existence and how it came to me and I was like clean my fingers run across um I I notice it's brand name and my fingers run across subtle in boxing on the talk of the lead\nAnd you know what that little South Bend his name was triumph\nTiny cell Center for one name ...
