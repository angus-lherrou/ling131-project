Todd flew out to Portland and I drove down to visit him and I stopped in this casino on the way to check it out as a new place it\nHad just opened a couple of months earlier and they happened to have a shuffle there was imperfect\nIt was interesting it didn't sufficiently randomized the car so I sat down and I attacked the shuffle the first day I got there are lots of ... which is normal swinging black went to Portland, Oregon and soft hot and you know we order the rabbit drinks and he said how you doing what have you been up to you\nAnd I said well you know I Am good yeah a little this little that I've been playing a little bit of blackjack and I could tell this question it was sort of forming a in his in his mind\nAnd he he he he was wondering I knew he was wondering you know ... Black Jack how like what does this mean and what contacts with a chain with other people are you on your life so I just preempted the entire thing and I said you know on my own my own bank roll my own money just a little bit of play and she was silent\nAnd I felt so angry at him\nAnd threw him and everybody else who he was representing\nAll my friends the people who loved me my mom and dad these all these people who I was you know I'd basically been keeping a pretty quiet and it was playing a little cards on the side and the thing is that there is a dark side and a light side in gambling and I had the thoroughly explored both sides\nI knew the difference\nBut the difficult thing about advantage game they're gambling with an edge is that this this situation that emerge when you're doing that and the certain circumstances that come up and the stories that you come back with are so far out and extravagant and frankly incredible that if you admit\nAny vulnerability or any uncertainty about what it is that you are doing in a casino nobody will believe you\nThat you have an edge they won't see you as this thing that you are representing yourself as they will see you as the stone cold opposite of that\nAnd so I didn't talk about it more I ordered the next round we drank the next day I was hung over back in the casino and the shovel as I say it was not random it's what you call a sequential shuffle an innocent ... shuffle everything you see\nComes back to you again it's essentially a shovel where it is possible to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact moment\nA specific individual cards are going to appear that's a little bit different from ordinary card counting it's very cool and this game that had an additional feature was which is that besides just the ordinary blackjack game they had a sign that attached to the blackjack game called the lucky lady\nAnd the lucky lady side that you place it right next year Black Jack ... and if you were dealt\nA queen of parts on top of another queen of hearts that would pay off at a hundred to ... and when I saw it I knew immediately this makes sense what you want to do in this game is to sequence the lady secrets the queen's hearts there are only six of them in the deck with a very very valuable and some of the previous day and a half I'd been\nA betting for queens of hearts and I caught a few but then nothing ever lined up in his way to win the jackpot but I was ... that was tough and I had a significant edge doing this and suddenly at this moment the man next to me it was actually dealt the hand of hands screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts\nAnd what that means is that there's a good likelihood that those two cards are going to appear within reasonable proximity of each other again\nAfter the chef and so I sequence that I've burned an image into my head sequencing is an Monica technique and use visual monitor you associate people from your life with each card and put them in a scene to remember the order and so I burn this image of the day there was shuffling\nI was alone at the small cars you know in a remote place but I wasn't entirely alone because in front of me in my mind where these images of the people that I use when sequencing and they were all my old blackjack college so I saw these prosperous ...\nA kind of brilliant people that I always held in such a floating passed me and I also I was not alone in a literal sense because next to me at the table was this other guy who'd been in the casino all morning this was a Wednesday morning for hours gambling and he had that same glaze look that the people I used to\nSit across the table from a gamblers anonymous meetings\nHats and the dealer finished shuffling and started a deal and I saw the cars come out that indicated the queen's we're in theory do and I placed\nTo best table maximum at this place it was three hundred dollars on two consecutive lucky lady squares and sure enough for the first round one queen of heart was dealt on one of my best which\nHad happened a number of times before I'd never won anything from it so I didn't get too excited the newer kept going around and on the second round on top of my queen of hearts she put another queen of hearts and then she stops\nAnd she looked at the table and she called over the boss and he came and she looked at the table and\nWould they eventually figure it out with something I already knew which is that a hundred times a three hundred dollar wager pays thirty thousand dollars around the time they figured that out I absorbed the notion that I had in fact just one that amount and in fact\nIn the turn of a single card on one hand had gone within crying distance of his fifty thousand dollar not I was trying to recover\nEventually\nSomewhat but grudgingly they paid the Kashmir I took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had in that casinos a small place I also took every fifty dollar bill\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I took this water and just stuffed it down my pants so that I was physically expanded\nIn this weird ... way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas\nI was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino people who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly what I had just one and they see me as a cashier they knew I was getting paid\nIn cash and so I moved briskly for the exit [noise] and ah briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you try to ensure I wasn't being followed and then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest\nSo [noise] uh [noise] and I felt expanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team linguist sense of\nParanoia verging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining the headlights of the distance trying to into it if any of the cars\nBack there look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is everything going to be All right thank you\n[noise]\nJosh beyond the reach of rockets\nAnd fairly dark men more I think life as a professional card counting blackjack player\nCatherine Burns demolished artistic director sat down to talk to Josh about its history with them on here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story at a party\nWas totally silent but everybody turn to you holding their attention telling this unbelievably riveting story and thinking\nThat at this party is actually what we want them off to be and he has to come do this at the players got it in front of two hundred fifty people instead of twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever might happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them\nAre I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact a lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning uh casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on

opposite of that and I'm I'm naturally you know missed my mother very much and I'm couldn't understand my management\nUh I began to write to my mother things that were not true I Would say that my aunt had mistreated me um had denied me food\nAh had um made me go without sleep all sorts of things that were not true ah [noise] and then I Would food the letters up and uh take them to be with me
