God Knows what I don't know\nI don't ever know what I was doing any more [noise]\nI just know that I'm I'm On fire [laughter]\n\nApple look strong [noise]\nAnd then about an hour later my ... would say how old is rose now in a moment would make the calculations well let's see jak died and sixty three when she was Seventy four\nAnd roses birthday was two weeks last Thursday and Joe died in sixty nine making her widow in eighty one so eighty five and then they break for lunch [noise]\nAfter lobster and drawn butter and housing us down they'd all hustle back to their posts and they watch and every now and then there'd be something they didn't know hey who's that who's that who's that so they dropped the family tree and this and they analyze it they come up with a profile and they'd cracked the code wanna Bobby's [noise]\nNow any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable [noise] oh I just pray to God they don't tell poor senile rose about Bobby it'll breaker [noise]\nSo then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation you don't see Jackie my chair\nAnd then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully\nNow all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins and the water [noise]\nAnd the summer when we were nine years old we found something now\nHad an aunt perhaps in an effort to ease a cramping her prying neck just sort of glance towards the water she might have seen us climbing into this tiny plastic happens slated boat she might have cried out an alarm at the lack of oars in life best [noise]\nShe might have had a connection fit\nTo see a shovel off and drift into the violent rip tide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the ... found very [noise]\nNot didn't and we did it all happened so fast that we were swept out and it wasn't until we realized that we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really far from shore we were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to for hopping dots\n... it was like Gilligan's Island for real so Atlantic\nSwell crashes over our heads and as soon as the water clears out of our eyes a powerboat pulls up out of nowhere and in this power about\nOur David and Michael Kennedy\n[noise] so David Michael pose up into the boat and we're like oh my God we're saying by\n\nSo the ...\nSends us back to shore and were psyched\nBecause we're saved until we start to watch the four hopping ... back into our for crazed livid aunts we are so going to get it\nNow my family under any circumstances has it's really weird thing but they each have their own thing about like yelling and getting a huge trouble like my ... like she gets so freaked out but all she can do is yellow are addresses like Eileen and Kevin two Seventy five ... [noise]\nMe Kayla one eighty asylum road\nI Swear to God I grew up in the fall and wrote um [noise]\nVery telling piece of my jobs with [laughter] or the pat would\nDo these things where she would say these things that were like actually kind of nice things but she'd say them like they were death threats she'd like get off the view from drowning you get on that beach towel and you light and that son now\nOr did you say I'm going to buy you a birthday present you eat that cake now\nSo we knew that this was what was coming the Kennedy boys didn't so thereby viciously panned and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves now what happens is our on our out of their minds they're ready to Flay us but when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys\nIt's like they don't have the emotional capacity to handle it [noise]\nThey're kinda like freaking out to yell at us but they start fake smiling and trying to act all normal and my mom\nI was just like to take fun just like Kennedy esque way of speaking which is sort of half way between Katharine Hepburn and like the queen of England [noise]\nAt them like what are you guys doing and they're smiling the smile but\nWhen they smile at us it's like you just wait but they're like oh David oh Michael thank you thank you thank\nYou and they're mad at us for almost drowning they're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us like don't those people have enough trouble [noise]\nNow you [noise]\nLike as if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy [noise] so these poor boys finally pull and pride themselves away from my odds to get back on the boat and they're leaving and my mom was going to give all best your grandmother [noise]\nAnd now it's time for our for real punishment which was that we for the rest of vacation had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water [noise]\nSo it's a hundred degrees out and after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like emptying out all the copper tone and kicking sand we break my pets last nerve and she said All right you can go in the water but only up to your knees\nWere happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to your\nKnees is and then we get the great plan of having chicken fights so we started to have chicken fights but it's kinda weird because there is only three of us so\nWhat we're doing the best we can have a chicken fight like that and like knock each other off into the water so we get fully immersed and then my uncle out who never ever played with us ever\nComes into the water to play chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter and my cousin Eileen up on his shoulders\nAnd then I get up on my cousin Kevin shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like actual family fun for a moment and we're like you know hitting each other are falling in the water and then I take my foot and I accidentally kicked the side of my uncle alf head really really hard\nHis eyeballs pops out of\n[noise] falls into the water and sinks\nI have it and I are in instant complete shock [noise]\nThis minute there is still a part of me that it's on that beach screaming [noise]\nHave no idea that he had a fake guy\nWe know that you could fake I I Would you know they didn't tell us that you know I'll go out how to bake I 'cause they didn't want us blob and it to the whole neighborhood so they didn't tell us that we didn't know when like later on you know there was Colombo and Sandy Duncan but this was way before\nWe had no idea\nSo we're standing there and it's like so horrible like I Can't even like I'm like oh my God and and my cousins I meaning having a staring at me with complete hate like you broke our dad\nAnd my ... out is standing there he's got the lid open [noise] so you can like the inside the socket right now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone\nAnd like you can just say I'm Sorry to someone that you just [noise] I don't know what to do and my ... is hysterically screening because that eyeball costs top dollar\n[noise] it was a special magnetized eyes to keep up with the other one [noise] and now I had just better pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back because now they're gonna have to buy a brand new top dollar I was not the budget\nSo I just didn't know what to do I was like my life is over I Am no longer ma Kayla I'm now ... girl who kicked out in the Cape\nAnd it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other ... are getting in on it like and who's to blame part of the conversations happening so I just kind of back off into the water\nI'm kind of like going back and like regrets thing back to like where life as I once knew it had ended\nAnd I just stand there and like I kind of wish I had drowned\nAnd I kinda wish the Kennedys hadn't saved me and I've been told and into the waves and I just I just feel like sifting through than than shells and ... and it's totally ridiculous but like I Will never stop looking for this I I'm going to look forever and I keep looking and looking and I'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there was an eyeball in my palm\nFake staring right at me and so I mean I drop it back [noise] and it sink back into the water\nBut now we know it's possible so everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting through and I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this guy\nAnd I also kind of pray that it not be me the west that finds it this time after like an hour and my cousin Kevin finds the eye and he holds it up and try Anthony does not let go\nAnd my uncle now takes the guy he like washes it off and just pops it back\nAnd then you kind of like tests that you know and it's like keeping up with the other one so it's working spell\nWhat's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake and now that you know it's a guy is totally looks like a fake eye and I can't believe it I never noticed it wasn't a fake before\nSo now the occasions back on and so everybody gets back\nInto their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did and I have not really fully re integrated back into the family yet I'm kind of standing apart and I notice that they're actually it's been like kind of a group of people who've been watching this whole thing\nAnd then I say something that I didn't notice that no one noticed and that's led to the Kennedy kids David and Michael had taken a walk on the beach and I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had to sit there and seen the entire episode that", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city":
