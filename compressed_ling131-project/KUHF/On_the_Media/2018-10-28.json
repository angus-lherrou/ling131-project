sensitive listeners so be warned ... or we go back to reporter\nBritish at this point it was just ... in the room and he told him yes he had killed dump whiskey and he also killed other people\nToo and the episodes when Darrow killed people seemed to have followed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches and you know become psychotic and\nDo horrible things when it came to the details sheep tended not\nRemember but then Carol mentioned two particular girls who were then missing and whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year old to touch and another girl sixteen year old only shock [noise]\nStudent that was from Chicago She's the girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping\nThat Carol might have some information earlier that summer her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since at least a hawk she was a high school girl from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run\nBut Garrett told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents she doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine night\nShe touch with my life\nLike it wasn't even in doing the stabbing right\nLike this is what do you do well first and foremost you had to ask yourself is this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be\nA dream he had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and and presented strategy you need to know uh what actually happened\nW walks out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and\nWe take off to go\nLook for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital a burden\nVeteran mix and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you rub pies are high but you're scared your concern you fear real food if you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police so eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd we're new new one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes they'll do you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose the tail\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get\nHere this method as far as I say we can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise] someone\nOut there last February with reporter Lauren ... and letting towns supervisor of Mariah ... father says it's on a road that goes to the mines or what have you know through their minds [noise]\nIt was this sort of hilly area south side of the road this trail around or you're just a very icy that day\nThis hair is used to be an overall [noise] we're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly speech there were no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came and\nHair smells right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits results trudging choose for is looking for\n[noise] but you know the worst book [noise] um [noise]\nFrom this\nFor ... well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground in a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given me such you know you don't want to slide down in there and so\nThey couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe some blue\nSneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this ... which does it end he yells back up to a Belgian get me out of your money back up very\n\nEventually ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers\nTried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep your confidences over trying under the current rules\nYou're questioning yourself\n[noise]\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder am I in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for a way to give the information you know ... call\nSure why didn't you\nKnow [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we'll do it openly\nYou know uh I don't want\nTo do you ever do you ever break\nKnow according to him now\nYou know in my mind was doing what I saw was a proper ethical and legal\nMoral moral thing to do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girl disappear\nTheir bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students body and discovered by two kids were playing up in the mines Alicia\nUm I guess that's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to a cemetery as walking through and and stumbled upon her and so she has discovered than to and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of all the blue ski begins\nRobert ... primary line of defense or apparently be not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decide to do is to put Darryl on the stand\nAnd you just get the facts and Guerra would tell his whole life story to a shock to jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes ... at the time he was nuts Sharon Smith channel flicks news in pleasant\nSo\nThe trial opens um\nThe courtroom is jam packed prosecution starts they have a really good case they've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County and then it's time for the defense to start their case\nTo Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand Garrett gets an stand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible\nSevere beatings and abused by parents\nVery little education basically gets sent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servants when he's seven you know ... and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals and then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life\nAnd he admits to killing Alicia and Susan\nAnd what happens next ... nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the bag then\nThe next day Belgian Armani hold a press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nAbout Robert does this other services because they had the duty to protect our clients secret\nReading or rotted were here and you know\nBut everyone is disgusted with columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr just no way in the world you're going to convince your average non lawyer everybody turned against them but this was anything short of shabby some very good on the lawn of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money and do jihad actually tried to use these dead girls and ...\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law issues buzzer them\nOur money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as crazy phone calls people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you only get to at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the backyard and started to carry a\nMy bag\nYou get shot gun in the car he kept on in the house so\nRecruits leader who was that was the worst moment to [noise] or some horrible for\nHis book it's\nJune twenty seventh rubber Guerra who was convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how did how did that feel for you\nRelief you know\nThere's still would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring against the two attorneys ...\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and build you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice\nOr states public health law and the provision that says the body must be given a quick in decent burial and on top of that\nWe're remembering the career where\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money Adele gee so basically they were then facing disarmament and an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\n... started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice moved to Florida or money tough it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore\nOr loosely well what else can I Do to make a movie he was just\nBarely getting by for a little while I think the\n... all all new to stress and pressure to shoot truth will\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is the Belgian her money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo\nNever dreamed\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer do do do the\nJob [noise] uh ... I was a good lawyer\nSo so so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a dead bodies case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people say what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which\nProved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone\nCalls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and okay\nOkay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd\nGone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality and so I sort of wanted to just start\nWith that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law school and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Houston", "day": "28"}
