'cause I just told you good morning in so he um but I forgot to say good evening so oh okay so great I mean we were just\nA [laughter] anyhow [laughter] we call Greg out because he had written this article for this great website called trance dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I can tell you that story that you are yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as a translator but it's the word serious\nWhen the ... here in a serious like how can the U.S okay I'm In my experience when you hear this where serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern\nIt actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nFor serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bribe oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um [noise] but the story that I Want to tell you as\nGood afternoon everybody I'm I'm really pleased to be a doctor in Africa Secretary Kerry ... and city of enormous energy and it just a few\nDays before carry visit Ninety journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and Secretary Kerry was given this press conference I shared my concerns about a young Ethiopians blogger that I met last year\nA ... who ah with age of his peers I've been in prison and I firmly believe that the work of journalists weather as print journalists are in the Internet or media because it makes societies stronger\nYou know he said all the things you do you expect him to say that um they believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country buffet block but we remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia with this comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise of Ethiopia\nAnd I'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry\nCredit or give us John I Want to give it a shot I Know it was very efficient\nSort of before he left the party and he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like call an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure I got a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second row\nThe guy in his twenties boyish face wearing a moustache\nI've only two questions for\nUs it may have invited artist question of the day that\nBut one question for us focus\nSo let me she was a you have raised double ... or not the names of liquor\nWho's at Logan in these friends there are in much of this guy's like well every time a journalist is arrested us gives a statement about Best Buy these things out of this keep happening every piece of repeating very much so then he asked this question\nIs you leap sort of you or audio seriously because of a double it's ... it's just lip service or are you seriously concerned [noise]\nAt this point everybody's just nominate Cary they're all looking at these journalists who obviously had to take considerable personal rest in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV stations you disguise on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrest a journalist\n... we really ...\n...\nAnd Teri and looks at him like well\nYou've got to be kidding what I stand up in public and I and I say something um\nI I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that ... and when I raised\nHim by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nSerious the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much is are you doing something preferably a Lincoln\nFinancial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is when are you just talking about this or are you doing something may be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or withdrawing support in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously calls for the release\nOf these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it and it seems\nTo me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry on this uh this film and oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I must sound like some kind of cultural a guide me\nBecause that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space is serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you\nGoing to do yeah this is as us exactly my point are you going to take sanctions maybe going to see the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk\nMaybe who knows is that is a job description doing good journalism in Egypt you\nMake so much think he'd be hearing from my numbers on there [noise]\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did do you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether didn't suffer for this question in any way no but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I and then he ... Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally I'm good I'm good I\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I got to lighten up a good thought them together to them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages were from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this if you will be an anti terrorism task force will wage social media tax by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\nIn on the theater and he's in full force out of the ones that are in these kinds of things\nAnd where they threatening yeah\nSome of them where you know some skiing in the bunch Dakota being the one good thing comes and it might come one\nNewspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSecure in my safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother and I ... in your your Washington\nBut don't became the landfill\nCar crashes became automobile accidents\nOf me so what do you get\nA little more young\nPeople that\nNot going to do and I mean do\nYou do a little bit\nSooner you do\nReference number four imagine a lot of Coca Cola like bubble for your tone for ... for the DVD ... overcrowded now your truck [noise]\n\n... [noise]\nThis is Emily my name's Emily Garcia an artist\n[noise]\nSome of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by a truck\nGoing into a coma and her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands [noise]\n\nOf all the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the Komen begun to recover but she was blind totally blind right yeah and like no light and he can nothing coming in now okay needless to say it was a very big adjustment\nI just know I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world and chest myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to draw\nI had ... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel the wax on the paper [noise] um\nYeah but then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call\nFrom the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah it's a school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental among thunder a long story short a Emily shows up the lighthouse school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed gives her the thing he gets his device can you describe it I mean is it a big moment\nNo it's not it's just say and regular pair of glasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says 'cause right on the front like on the bridge and the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attached to the sun glasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing is made of titanium\nAnd it's just say the size of a postage stamp\nAnd little bit thicker though\nAt explained or is it a little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square puts it on your time put it right on the center of your tongue and close\nYour mouth so I put it on and they turned\nIt on 'em and it was like is there is to take off and that is a lot of Coca Cola like a lot of levels on your town and always like frankly\nThe idea behind this thing called a science writer Sam Kean author of detail of doing or surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the scenery ... hearing in our fingers in ... in the teasing dodging\nBut that's actually not how words each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerds and it is the brains then converts of little blips into what you perceive as a site or sound or smell no obviously\nSomeone who was blind the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what\nIf there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains and all of our brains there lots and lots of past\nIt's going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist it's like there's a road there but it's shut down in traffic can be on it but what if you could open up some of those round\nHe just let me say with an eye for an hour two hours\nEmily says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change and every time I looked around he said oh that's a chair\nThat door asking me actually mine and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square of ... and nothing was really happening for except for the perfectly feelings on her tongue\nBut then there was this moment and had this really long Styrofoam rod and he last day in front of me he moved at I think down in front of my face\nAnd they'll say oh my God what was that\nSuddenly she says she just thought that was like oh my God [laughter]\nIt's just happening I oh ... what does it look like in some of The Mind's eye it looks like\nA long white skinny stick did you see the texture of the sticker um no\nI couldn't see ...
