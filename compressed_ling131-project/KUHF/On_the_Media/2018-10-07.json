I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nWe're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something Hi\n[laughter] okay good good where are we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again in the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps average statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMe writing and Harris than to budge on her and will become\nSort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a\nIs a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody attracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement\nBut I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBurned so birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... invent sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida ... three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work do you how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nOh this is not just a thing for one person this is a network\nLike almost everyone there had lost either a a cousin or a brother or a\nHusband like even even daughter to ... ... and in fact when I made a sports one of those women you just heard at one with the way to get in touch with Clinton twenty four year old son Roger Mitchell he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop we're actually going to get an extra later but she told me that I've met\nAbout four hundred other mothers they reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah through like traveling around through Facebook I've met ... other mothers who lost their children while [noise]\nDoes just seem like a fraction of that community center got the scales surprising rate and the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out and\nMan when children put up a boom bang bang bang\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad dude was my twin brother\nThat big fat and do\nThen they kind of recede ...\nAnd they're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happens if they get like folded up into the network ...\nSeveral\nUntil at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big around dining tables users\nOnce upon a time of all there were ...\nAt ... levels\nWe are used for low for\nUntil after the prayer\nChristel House I'm back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nAnd then by just totally changed and somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big tables lines are\nOh no no no no comment which is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was working for like a guide for me what we got on the table because I'm just a one on the table yeah just what's on the I mean the cable right here so I think you have to have you\nWhat about you got your ... your ... your ... you've got to bake it you've got your topics you got everything you want to have to get nice good old I\nGot to get him a show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra Bland and keeps you don't remember [noise]\nTimes all the research officer didn't\nSeen her plan is pulled over and small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car\nMind putting out your cigarettes please\nOur law you'll have it right now out of the car and I have the right I Do have the right now\nOr remove them get her a mold for us out\nFor our movie I'm giving you a lawful order\nHere now\n\nA car and he actually was\nMeant to be seen it gets out of the car but you know you don't often get it over\nMuch\nCinder was eventually take in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found dead\nHang with the plastic garbage bag the desk was ruled a suicide and centers family disputed that ruling\nYou got everything you want to have to get nice good old I\nGot to get him a show in Geneva read beyond them other than to relate\nRain coming from I ... I Want to let you are you one thing I Want it after you come to come to like this before Oh yes sir\nUs in Missouri last week\nGo all around we try to support as many mothers and\nThat exactly like that what it is it really just like us force Yes sir it's a it's a point because that mother who has lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like they're\nIn the same situation and they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something then and I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nEat the sense that their their experiences is really unique sort of\nLaw it's up to lose somebody that cancer I've lost a friend that cancer recently Amtrak\nIs a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do the embed numbers even though the numbers and so\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's just weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kinda right\nTo get into ... brown\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of them on their on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or you know just wanted to know in Missouri\nAnd has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping for you right you're right we all just simply trying to\nOur way is a crystal gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the larger staged\nA certain point was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand\nOkay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThat I open my windows and I just knew will go buy a house that she says the stage comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house into and and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nTwo summers went on fire [noise]\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we start to stay over here to chat with how\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know a air mattress and it becomes like a huge sleep over and first of all going to see for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some advice over his shoulder thoughts like therapy for\nFigures let me ask you but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really\nSon who's ... pounds to\nNews when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people ham and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass we usually the video that\nMom's house probably over like right now\nThen the police car that came behind them was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nBut let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased in in policing because they're spies we all have biased in is a trick is and I don't know what to trick at a I don't know of any of us know how to contain that how do we stop that bias from coming for when you make a decision\nRent and I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and always seems like um it's like it just feels like a kinder way to say here like a fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop\nWhen you look at some of the shootings record on video and I and I think of the poor school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota oh the clinic steel shooting yeah there's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms\nI'm a good guy I have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon and you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo when the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason that officer ... threat level with a baby in the car\nAnd I got a guy and his ... his kid and his girlfriend according stomach gun permit older this is this is an easy car stuff for some reason and and and the reason is because of the color of the main skin all of those things never registered black guy receivers by his pocket\nAnd as you and and I would like to tell you and all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you\nThat we don't you don't want people and they're twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cop I'm appalled at what I see when those videos I cannot believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control\nSome of them I understand what's going on I mean you're wrestling and run for your life and you and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or this perceived\nThreat in my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using it real life scenarios\nThat take that extra split second before you fired your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled removed you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the side plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you would have thought it was warm and getting oh my God they're gonna get is killed one reality what he did was each slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThe color of my glass coming out of my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again this idea of time\nIn certain situations slow down when you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down\nLike whatever you can do you've covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found is that also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some believe she's the only to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because\nThere were the there was this the ... so we know how to communicate is like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and I'm Serious about whether the drive through at McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that he touch it and police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the academy or ... years\nHave never been in a physical fight which is a problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and then way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on you know so that Ben says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bouncers or for ... what he said\nJust my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know what\nOh the policy basically no how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nHere's you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff over there for Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day you have to get to know people\nYeah yeah for sure and so to make this point it would get up on me down the hall to another office\nSent me down into computers sound comes out of us when we say OK showed me this video to video starts\nIn silence and his body cam video it's a body Kim on the cop who is driving a squad car and he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as your side is a\nPartner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's run around and I tried to stab people he's off his meds I think he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly where they parked flow neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking to him copper in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big negative than any walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body chemicals out the taste or the other officers out it was added a phrase is behind him with his firearm out and the\nGuy I wrote it down is approaching approaching approaching approaching me get within like ten feet of the cops and then hey hey\nHey hey [noise]\nThe guy was fighting him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got his gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the probably\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shy shy about to get shot I say that you want to die if you want a guy [laughter] you can't guy\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of counseling and\nSo the two top pick them up and walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the UN's huh\nThis is the thing that you guys were you use this video for what it guys warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to do with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nUnlike the neighborhood that I mentioned on the front step ... what are you doing man that dared doesn't stupid but but you don't have close to being ... wouldn't be backwards medication I wasn't doing drugs that he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the big winners states ... his now listen ... she would was elected sheriff of Linn\nCounty\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum it's this big coalition of police chief twenty sixteen ... put out\nWhat they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some beans law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against",
