U. H. T. T. V. eight point six used to have a service of the University of Houston but also on Facebook at Houston Public media tweet us at Houston Public media's way you're\n\nListening to radio last [noise] radio from there'll be you and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm Janet I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that over don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not leap a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we ... it is on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may want to make one yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter] so\nAh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\n[laughter] Facebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you that work either this is one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling from faceless nursing\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nNow what Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest\nWould turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook one of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes knows when what would become\nA loud but do Facebook rocket\nAt Facebook\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEO but today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of the free speech\nHow are we going to keep everybody on the same page and so this small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger jumped up\nSixty people and then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for everything huh can we go through some sort of the ridiculous examples leaflets over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kinda Gore yes so the Gore standard\nWas headlined we don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside no good snow\nBlood pouring out or something like it was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to come up with rules about bodily fluids\nSeeming for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does a clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people that were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in is can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal\nMade out of stone [laughter] really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated ... constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule in fact\nAt this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month wow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed\nThe attachment clause so the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nipple of the woman oh and in fact a one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that\nBoth nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nSo this is what happens in American law all the time it's very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law\nSo common law is the system dating back to early England where individual judges would make a ruling which would sort of be a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges so the body of law was sort of constantly fleshed out and say is that any fact [noise]\nLiterally every time this team at Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight\n... plop\nSome things are going to show up and said that they weren't prepared for that and that's a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about this\nFor example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nWhich acts that escalate [noise] except\nAnd she comes upon this image of God\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressing skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats and the moderator throws your hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was this thing it turns out it's a survival practice\nAccording to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought unknown way to help your herd get through the drought is to uh if you if you have a woman who's ... to have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human kit\nAnd so there's nothing sexual about it's good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant it it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue that but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but\n[noise] but obviously breastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment and ask direct under the rules stating animals are not babies we are to that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed that they were they did was it was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo\nYet that outraged individuals or editor CERN wheeler why why did we make an exception because because when a problem grows\nLarge enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze\nIf they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to\nFeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair we're just trying to make something that works [noise]\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like from two thousand eight to now in just ten years'\nTime in that country power came in LA so is it is one of the idea\nOf a single set of rules that weren't that can be applied fairly and that's just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause\nWe've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to the\n... campaign would say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone from twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere's more in this building where faith but those are the source of content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start out sourcing some of this work places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and drawl as well\nAs I mean I Would guess that they're building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra that scene where they get their delicious treat everybody fever English and we\nSend them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on to their screen every day wow what we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like well\nI'm going to ask you sometimes get over that one out we\nFound out pretty quickly the waistline none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting even mean happening\nA lot about the good work and [laughter] but now I don't have money you know I'm Sorry you work in um [noise] I mean like we just came out of there I Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me\nDo you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that\nThat's totally fine you know I'm just going straight I don't want to take care\nTo explain that she and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike to talk about what I ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the\nCompany which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I like I got to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nCan I just I guess what he's high I also test every day I was just an edge as an edge to edge\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat just like they all do ... I was ... to ... X rated\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attacking chair you know people ...\n[noise] Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with a play at chess a lot of like a very\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night or he\nCatch him self thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were never specific like it is but I Will watch it was like OK says Clinton's ... ... S C I F R I like ... it was like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had that I chose to real [noise] [noise] I I saw that [noise] I ...\nIn Facebook jargon these are referred to as a a a non protected moderate fire\nJust means literally nothing [laughter] give us an example of this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers\nCab driver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category\nAnd so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected category of black mhm and so children Trump's black\nTheir child ... Trump's their blackness you can say whatever I Want about black children whereas in the case of white men uh you've got a you've got gender and race both protected you can attack them that's just a bizarre rule I Would think you'd go the other direction\nTo eat the protected class would outweigh the modify well they they made this decision as they explained to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend as a valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we'd say this is so bad we're going to take it down\nAnd in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation\nAnd if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech what you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be ... some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but\nDespite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic efforts\nTo eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech\nMakes sense well yeah because in sort of hate speech or are thinking about hate speech\nThere's this idea of of privileged or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection or because of being historically disadvantaged ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nAbout Japanese reinforced in the Nineteen forties cut off the side you\nHad Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two at the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand versus a ... foot half\nPut into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves a question like\nAre the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story and this happened at the exact same moment if they've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this trans National Community they realized what they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to have actually William way and consider who\nWhat is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all [noise]\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here in America these moderators only have like four or five seconds Republican not\nCome to make a decision and limited and beyond that even in those\nFour seconds is there enough time to to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given IP address you can easily be mass go back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity white children are better than black children [laughter]\nOn top of that we often don't know an individual's race strange people on the other categories or even less\nClear like sexual orientation and they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for our reviewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept and converted into a an engineering manual\nThat can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast\nSometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here\nAnd I just want to make sure I emphasize that these policies and they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently\nBut it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white or but when we come back those rules they get toppled so\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and
