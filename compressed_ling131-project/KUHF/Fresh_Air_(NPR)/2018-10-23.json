also says although the Saudi coastal it as diplomatic territory this was a murder committed on Turkish soil\nAnd that's just the rhythm that we that we communicate in and I feel like that has as much a place on the global stage or any stage as does any kind of well spoken well trained perfectly uh delivered sort of\nMid Atlantic found\nYou could probably tell do something I'm really passionate about also um my grandfather was a preacher in a Pentecostal church and I was listening the other day obviously with the passing or read the Franklin to um\nSome of her father's sermons CEO Frank and sentiments which I listen to from time to time I really love and that sort of whooping a style of preaching is what my grandfather did and what the other passions of our church did and there is a\nDefinite rhythm too that there's also a I'm a phrasing that those kinds of preaches employ that I think to my ear sounds a lot like Shakespeare in his is very useful to me in terms of um\nPlaying Shakespeare for example in the church there there might be safe you can imagine like a preacher up there at the at the podium and then there's often like uh a woman in the mother's boy who's sitting off you know to use right and that woman will often read from the Bible the past them I say during the Bible is if you were to the book of John chapter\nOf fourteen verse won through seven or read and then the the they might say let not your heart be troubled in the ... would say let's not your heart\nBe troubled read on\nIf you believe in God I Believe also me if you believe in God you know and it's this way of sort of\nA a of using language to uh\nLiterally like lift the audience up in the air and he can hold them in the palm of his hand and they'll stay there\nUntil they come to the next line does that make sense yeah it was the difference between her father loved me often invited me and her father loved me off invited me and when you sort of you know offer the language in that way people will hang around here we hear what else you got to say\nA fellow is a character that is specifically is supposed to be black he's he's the more so he's in he's the outsider\nAnd and I I think you know for\nI'm African American actors or or British Actors who want to do Shakespeare I like that the character that they are often given but do you feel like a like type casting and what do you know what I mean 'cause sometimes like that's the only role available to African Americans in Shakespeare\n... [noise] yeah that's a good question um\nYou know and I think back to my first sort of expressing interest in Shakespeare back when I was in college I'm from Alabama and I went to college in Florida\nAnd I remember the first time I sort of expressed being interested in Shakespeare fellow was approached by that I was given\nAnd at the time a sort of took offense to it you know I mean I was excited to read the play obviously but I also thought well you know why is this the only thing that's been given to me I'd also like to play hamlet and I'm interested in you know ... and all the other place to\n'em and so I rejected it for a long time and I know a lot of other actors you know African American actors of 'em and I assume black British actors to have had similar experiences and yet we [laughter] we all seem to come back to it at some point you know um\nBut ah yeah it's a it's a really complicated play I mean it's a beautifully written part but it's it's um\nAnd er I I think that came up to the next day of school that came in and I remember walking into into the gym and a dog they all were there and the kid John ... was there to\n... oh John there go straight to dream he'd beat you up you have to you're going to take that me you're going to take that and all the time I was going to please stop your please stop this but you know I got to keep the exterior like yeah man I did it you want to you want some more [laughter] but inside I was praying that he wouldn't get out\nBut from then on I was I was pretty much left alone for the rest of high school\nAnd I was going to have to ask you for moonlight your character I mean he's a he's a cook he has a reason to have a toothpick and his mouth that you use that to speak very expressive late to shell surprised to show concern [laughter] it was written into the ... did you decide like you needed it\nNo it wasn't written into the script but I did feel like I needed it I needed something because you know what I'm seeing is quite a long seen as a lot of changes in the same as like subtle\nI'm emotional changes in the scene that I wanted to play without overplay you know and and I felt like if I had something that I could work with that would help me\nRemarks some of those changes behaviorally that didn't require and I wouldn't fall into sort of over acting or over selling anything um so yeah the two favorite to fake became my best friend\n[laughter] you go through a lot of the things [laughter] oh a lot definitely my guest is Andre Holland the coast of moonlight forty to Selma and the neck\nAnd the star of the Stephen King inspired the series castle rock will him off and him after a break but first and asking you to contribute to the station whatever you can afford whether it's a little are

had happened but feeling so ashamed\nOf myself I guess that I didn't tell her that I took it home and hid it in my in my dresser drawer I still have it to this day but um that feeling of of\nOf shame that you know I just remember feeling well there there must be something wrong with me you know for her to say that to me and to treat me like that and I think that for a long time for a long time I walked around and sort of\nA internalizing that we've been created this pattern of behavior in me where you know I felt I had to prove my worst\nAll the time you know and that that wasn't allowed to make bad decisions or make mistakes or to be wrong but I had to be I had to be right you know every every time I've always been so frightened of being wrong um\nThat it's it's sort of kept me I'm\nIn the middle so\nThat's one of many examples that I could give but but you know I've thought about that a lot and ah\nAnd as I look back over my life I can see the places where that that like instances like that still to this day affect my uh relationships with people and the choices that are making them and I'm trying to do a better job of of um letting go of those things\nThat must have had a bit effect on you if you still have that Valentine's card\n[laughter] [noise] yeah yeah do I do a and it did and uh yeah and there there are a lot of things like that I remember yeah not to get to where they were I remember also there was um\nI had a I had a cousin who was very close to grown up who are\n... yeah I'm going to say that I was close to growing up and he he uh\nGot involved in some some bad activities he essentially he and some older some older some ... other people who I Know um had a very very bad idea to try and and um burger that rise this\nLittle five and dime store on in our that's an area where we grew up in and\nUm\nAfter they had gone in and and done with a stove and the you know a few hundred dollars or whatever it was at that guy on the way out my cousin who is Seventeen the time was shot in the back by the store owner ... and the store owner ah\nAnd and he was killed eventually he was he he died and I and ... yeah yeah it was thrown it was also my baseball coach G which yeah so there's [noise] there's always been down where I grew up this like\nA really kind of complicated um wow\nFriction between people in the community I grew up in the white people who also sort of share that same community or you know the community sort of adjacent to it there's always been this tension you know and and I often felt sort of in the middle of that like belonging to\nDefinitely belonging to my own family and my own culture in my own neighborhood but then also often find myself in you know like I went to a private school that was on the other side of town and and just not quite knowing you know where I fit how if it if I fit and\nA lot of the character that I play choose to play are also wrestling with I think some of the things that question of identity and where they fit so it's clearly has a question like a thing and I'm Still trying to figure out and and unpack all of that stuff is a baseball coach white yeah\nMy guess is Andre Holland he started moonlight and Nick and Selma and stars and the Stephen King inspired serious castle rock we'll hear more of the interview after a break when I saw Andre Holland ... I thought his performance was so good\nSo subtle I wanted to know who is actor and now that I've gotten to learn more about him and even more in on him movies music books they're an important part of my life hearing from people who create them only deepens my appreciation and comprehension of their work\nBringing you those people their stories that's part of what we do on public radio I support in public radio you're supporting in depth coverage of our popular culture\nAs well as in depth coverage of onions in my opinion that is really worth the investment pleased become a member of the station funky and mentioned ...\nYou can support public radio specifically this public radio station your public radio station by calling us right now at eight eight eight nine zero nine zero eight seven forgiving online but Houston Public media dot org support for Houston Public media comes from ... or Houston based intellectual property from where the offices in Europe and Asia\nAnd professionals who speak more than Fifteen different languages word oh S.
