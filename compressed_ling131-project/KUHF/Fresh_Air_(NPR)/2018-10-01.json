Russian interference in the election and connections between the Trump campaign and Russia which out with Washington Post reporter Greg Miller who broke several related stories and shared a Pulitzer this year we'll talk about the stories he broke including one about what she says\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nAnd we'll talk about reading and combing memo that in an Oval Office meeting between Colombian President Trump Trump complained about leaks and about a reporter and Miller realized he was that

ultimately got nine sources are telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with\nChris Rock and in fact it signaled that they could expect some relief from those sanctions when Trump was an office so you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues Adam and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with the source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations with sources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of the facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion the sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it [noise]\nThe your your team contacts\nFlynn to say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office\nAnd Flynn of course denied it and denied it and denied it and then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nWas a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nI'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had a previously scheduled interview with planned in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raised this question with him one last time to tell him look post as close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen so caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause on the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the\nSort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to there's we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Cameron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever use the word number nine I laid I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to to nail this down I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going\nAnd [noise] and [noise] and and [noise]\nSupport for

like yearly mammograms more at Texas oncology dot com back to pressure now\nRent is Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by meller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because nine and five intent\nYou know our fault that it is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are getting just weighing that is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time I mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many\nOf them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff to um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans until almost a month later as sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless this is a you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this in the book\nAnd Brennan feels like he's coming to these leaders would frightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has the subject of they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate\nDeeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells them\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will I Will call the administration out on that I Will accused the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would uh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia's trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm no ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refused to go along they're sort of stuck\nThey can't see a way past that it takes them months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose\n[noise] you know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference and this was in late September [noise]\nI'm with a letter to state election officials from all four leaders of Congress warning of unnamed ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell even I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mention of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets of started to look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um\nSo so meanwhile John Brennan who is trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell is saying oh yeah if you say that public am going to say you're interfering in the election so Brennan recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it\nAnd then try to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um the tell us that we're in a different political year than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeem to overwhelm everything else including the concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states what is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we see numerous cases through this period in which um when\nSenior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them their impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of Trump's victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and they take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\n\n\nTonight on Houston Public media TV ain't POV examines the influence of untraceable corporate money on our elections and elected officials and the impacts of the Citizens United decision it's dark money tonight at nine and Houston Public media TV eight\nSupport for NPR comes from ... and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their homes quote exploratory\nSome quotes in the ratings are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progress now that's progressive\nAnd from the R.
