that exist and three or four or five years ago or two years ago\nIn a way that's very different than how the United states under either democratic or Republican president spoke about the very same

to lead it's used a vision\nNPR's next senior vice president for news will be Nancy Barnes she's currently the executive editor of the Houston Chronicle and leads the newsrooms of Hearst other newspapers in Texas newspapers have garnered numerous national awards under her leadership\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother and uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain\nHow really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult\nAnd I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist and when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's the big reason why she went away\nTo reading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of you know what let me just mentally shove that [laughter]\nThey can focus on being a dad to the human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee I have to explain to the readers fully why she's going the way for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall or or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the outlaw how to Terry and I and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you 'cause they were afraid you'd become a word of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon and and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in our house um she's really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child or [noise]\nSo I sat down with her and I explained her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published do a classmate didn't come in and say oh I Know this about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\n[noise] well [noise] ... one of the stories you turn the book is that when you started living with your grandparents were shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother you wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\nThat is true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in that as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship in their name but the western art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and it was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children and they suddenly got their book signed and after they got their book sign they you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were with an ear shot at my wife\nShe died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday on my wedding shower was that Sunday and the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen\nAnd we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her and it's oh gosh ... we're so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah Phil do you think your grandparents are different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a child about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force and these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out\nBut if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nWhoa like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the uh my my both my parents had stuff and addictions and their addictions on both sides so ah so I was always very wary\nAnd very careful of that and um you know so ... ... because of\nMy mother I mean um my mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated ... she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would drop say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther so then I Would draw the pink panther and then I Would write back and request Garfield\nAnd the a police officer try to pull her over and she would try to outrun them she did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will\nAnd you know you do ... I Would worry I'd wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people\nJust she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long and at a trial process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise]\nAnd and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated by kind of want to see her one more time and and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had plane that was for sponsor and we later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they started wouldn't be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks for shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Houston", "day": "16"}
