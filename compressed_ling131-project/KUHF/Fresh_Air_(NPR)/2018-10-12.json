failed coup against president ... or to what\nMaking this up so so I Love the idea I tried to put in the end but I just showed the back of somebody I showed no nudity I showed\nThe one shot and affects normally you would never reproduce that would never become a still is is the sexy girl walking away from you out of focus a shot that no one would ever produced all the still in the show are ones that would never be produced I did a whole theory called marks\nWhere I just took photographs off the floor when I was making the movie Packer of the tape marks the crew puts down that the actors have to hit to stay in focus and that's the only thing in the shop everything that would be in the movie is called the actors the costumes props and all that's left is the one thing you can't show in a movie still\nSince a few of the shots in your book allude to you know a rotted movies or or poor movies I'm Wondering how you discover pornography as he can't she\nDiscovered point as a kid Peyton place was the first dirty book I'd ever rather than I had heard about it certainly men bingo was another one and that's like kind of a great movie\nUm playboy me playboy was the first thing that you could ever really see now gay porn was a very very different thing there was a store called Sherman's downtown that had those magazines like van vigor and they were supposedly muscle man magazines but it was it was kind of a coded thing was the first gay magazines I ever saw\nDid your father have a pornographic books or or ... magazines and when that you could sneak peaks at\nNo he didn't but he did have Peyton place and I did read his copy of Peyton place\nEveryone had Peyton place my grandfather had paint ties Peyton place was the biggest number one bestseller for weeks and weeks and weeks and it led to Jackie's Suzanne that led to Jackie Collins that led to that entire genre of work\nBut um but she did it first and she did it best and she had such great titles another one of her books with the tight white collar about appraised at such a good size [laughter]\nBut but she didn't handle success so well I mean she divorced her husband she moved to a plaza hotel and she drank too much and died basic rights\nSo that's not the best a success story but the book was so famous that when I went back to New Hampshire where where she wrote the book they still talk about her [laughter] and the town in the library I only had one tattered copy\nBut I did go to her grave and grace has been a\nGreat heroine of mind\nWhen you started finding pornography and straight pornography what was like what was it like reading or seeing photos that were fetish rising women's bodies when women's bodies weren't when it was an out for you [noise]\nWell when I looked at those pictures I always looked at it in a way to see how far could go the same way I went to\nUm heterosexual exploitation movies all the time that had no male nudity to see how far could go I was interested in how the taboos would fall how it started with a new discount movies where the first things I saw and and you would see\nBaron brass on women and some times acids but once in a while a male asked but they had to be playing volleyball so you know that was not so erotic to me but I've never had a night where I met horny let's put it that way [laughter]\nYou get to see the new this can't ... and these were needed in the movies and I'm obsessed and simply for supposed to be documentaries about healthy alternative lifestyles in jail and they didn't really about the nudity where do they play where did you get to see them\nI can tell you right where one of my favorite theaters but rex movie theater in Baltimore which is now at church when I was young\nGetting underground movies when I made them they were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always\nBy doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was a ... to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I like the Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it [noise] um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dry but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously\nAnd he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazine for it there were many off at the time fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version\nBut we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we had a secret service agents\nAnd I'm divine waving to the crowd there are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue and a\nAnd a and then it is scored to our classical music where there's one note that as the gun shot and then divine crawls over the trunk of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive later that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white uh\nA sixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brutal filming them one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in our world that the frame as the hype frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was\nThat saying that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral racial anything and I didn't and I didn't\nAnd I I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if he wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my fans thanks er Memphis army math you know I I Know what he meant what does he have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day and that's what I wrote they don't have friends that is what friends are foreign our reporters [laughter]\nSo you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's\nA chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter on Tennessee Williams\nOr this one is called ... okay the kindness of strangers\nMe just say this is John Waters gassed his new book is ...\nRole models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him citizens tendency ...\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life the first time I went to a gay bar I was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to it if the chicken pox and it was filled with early Nineteen sixties gay men and fluffy sweaters who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seem to fit the gay stereotype even then and sexual ambiguity in turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and his work my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to legend and even if the sex lives of those characters one always healthy they certainly seemed party\nTennessee Williams was in a gay cliche so I had the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nSo he gave you confidence to be gay but not to stereotype of what was going to have\nMe the confidence to be a beatnik right way to get a beatnik or to not even to be a beatnik was gay that's very different you know you went into a field of all different kinds of rebels\nAnd their sexuality was always still my friends are doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people that say um [noise] oh you should go this age and he has all gay people when I go there ... all black people that are being good or bad I mean that's what counts [noise]\nSo um I I always liked the gay people that had trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break some with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nHow have you changed in terms of what you want to do with with your same unless people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into\nYour art in it 'cause you've you do shows ... lemon shows you've written personally uh you know all over the years and the people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others my personality is why probably Johnny Mathis I'm In the house or why ... pornographers I left in the house let me in a trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people that that I look up to that haven't even if they've had terrible things happen in life because they've had a more extreme life and I've ever had an and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think\nWhat would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody liked to barge and people's health and a half of personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that\nBut when you're running a book you're allowed to do that that's acceptable\nAnd that's why people tell me everything on airplanes strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets\nAnd I think because they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I I actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good counselor I wouldn't be a good shrink actually\nAnd I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to the psychiatrist so I think you have to participate in whatever business it in your you were trying to be involved and\nSo getting back to Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the model of lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred bucks all cataloged\nI'd like to read books I don't collect ... sometimes struggle ... from what I read them yeah I like to read um people always say to me how can you read so much and I say that you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television simply read all the time\nAnd I'm On airplanes all the time so um it it's I Love to read is how I relax I Do find that a compulsive cataloging them as being\nJust being nice to my airs [laughter] and you have ... of course as much of a control freak because I Am you don't think I have my ... and I even know where I'm going to be buried we all bought plots a lot of my friends were like people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you say that a ... ... is it the same salmon herring that divide in um so why why if you don't my asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to going great graveyards when I was young and find would still flowers for parties we'd have a couple of beers I like the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I'm both maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've never taught that sounds like a good idea\nBut then I panic about real estate prices and what we're supposed to wear on our renewed so I go into that in the ... my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever as to who wants to be very 'cause like you really like graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like ravens are peaceful they're quiet and we're all going to be birds are friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi Maine cod to everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it it some and my mother at first I thought it would be strange to tell my own family 'cause I think it's a great idea because not your sister's going to be buried were husband that you know so\nSo um I I liked the idea you feel that you're not getting married next no they didn't I was afraid\nTo come and they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried\n... my father was in front of an aging motive\nMeat prices that I didn't I never bought a great but it sounds like a rip off to me and they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out there they were going to school [laughter] and um and I thought wait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up because I like the ... and she told me a price I said I'll take a double [laughter]\nI got like a lot of room around me too because the prices quite fair to bathrooms [laughter] I got two bedroom [laughter] to have you thought it through like what kind of like Tim soon\nYes I I kind of want it to be modeled after ...\nAnd I want mine to just say my father's is the same and I didn't realize until I saw recently his grave or 'cause he only died a few years ago just said John F. waters junior today I was one of the day I was like who wants to risk a joke that have to laugh at trinity humor changes [laughter] talk about an old joke\nWas on your I think it's the only time it should be quite simple on your grave stone what's on divine stone I'm praying hands but his parents put his real name\nDivine on rising and loving and people oh my God they read stuff all over it and they leave stuff it and leave doughnuts and dresses and it's it's um visited quite a
