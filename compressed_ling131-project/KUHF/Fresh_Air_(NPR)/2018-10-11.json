reports the astronaut and that caused by not were unharmed\nSince the space shuttles retired and twenty eleven NASA has relied on Russian rockets in space capsules to get asked shots to and from the space station it's the only way up or down for people this time the rocket blasted off from Kazakhstan and the transmission from Russian launch controllers seems normal but then\nWhen they found out that\nThe capsule made a sudden rapid descent now says there'll be a thorough investigation no new crew will be able to go up until that says resolved\nPursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're you know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally true in great um\nSince then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance was good but he almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do\nYou know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he'd like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of evidence so it's more likely than not\nThat the act occurred um\nIt's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here although many attorneys do not agree with that um so what\nDo they what are these proceedings along [noise] did they bring people in who will support their point of view is there an investigation ... or\n... you know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different and there are different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the funds to take it seriously\nI'm so we'll investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them\nThey'll send a letter to the accused and say you are being brought up on this they'll you know say okay well we're going to probably have our case and a couple of months so get everything ready and\nYou know there is no real system to help the accused him a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely call their parents right\nThere on their own they're at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother who sets them up with some attorney were may or may not have an idea of how to\nActually help this boy then there'll be some sort of proceeding and\nYou might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge her case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why\nThese college systems have developed to\nDeal with charges of sexual assault is because President Obama sent out basically a a letter of guidance right or was it wasn't a law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain\nWhat title nine is which was passed as a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation\nAnd signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSuit title nine is just a short law that nobody in the university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender and I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether\nTitle nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many\nYears President Trump secretary of education Betsy divorce is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making that he diverse has been very\nConcerned about the due process in a campus courts [noise] she\nWe'll solve this maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise] so um\nIt is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nSo I think there are um some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I returned and eventually\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I read excessively that lesbian where I went to school which is not exactly known as a ... have been but there were a bunch of friends there and while I was reporting the book um say wetland decided to shut the all of those ... down\nSo you know I didn't know that until I read your book but I'm sororities are um by the Greeks code or or whatever it is are already is aren't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties only fraternities can do that\nAnd that's a kind of an equal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus who are going to control the party atmosphere since people\nBack to alcohol at parties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issue that universities have boys still\nReally dominate the social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who got a four year colleges are in profits now\nWhich is the population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs you can't even have parties at sororities in America that's the ... rules so the guy's got to have the\nParties at their houses and they set the rules and they set the costumes theme and the theme is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily close to I Would just kind of shocked that the animal house eat those which we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke\nHas really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do and then when it's over it's all scribes and it's just like crazy thing you did in college ... no actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences\nYou know some woman are saying now ... what we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminishing the amount of sexual assault on campus is just stop rape culture\nWhat is meant by that\n... culture um is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so you know this rape culture is\nTake culture where their rape myth that whether it's outfit or alcohol consumption has caused her rate\nAnd nobody questions these attitudes the box and the victim like nobody says it doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or doesn't matter how much\nYou drank they say well victims are kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers there's all these reasons why\nA woman would make up the story maybe she's just trying to live so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend et cetera\nSo what we really see about rung the young generation is his refusal to participate in that culture and also very differently than in the nineties when I was in college\nBack then of course we talked about sexual assault a lot in the early nineties during that PC era but what we were taught us carry me go to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your safe on your own down these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem ... and there's times will say things like\nDon't get raped and then they'll cross out\nSome of the word so let's go rape no it's boys who have to change its the into tuitions that have to change this is about institutional accountability\nLesson about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll use beyond say as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women and so many men and women just\nI mean adore her understandably\nAt the same time in so many of her concerts over the years\nShe's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's and there's a ... a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise] um it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise]\nUm so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object as a sexual out as somebody\nI Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on a more sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses well\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is us empowering or is this denigrating 'em\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I Am my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self object vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that the somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears was just like\nIt they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same ideas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a slug because this is the way people dress and now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts of a beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... the you know it's it's crossing a line wave from scanty to something may extremely sexual but this is what they believe is empowering\nNow we have all sorts of data also saying that they have a huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts six at rest so there's there's a flipside to that that they were adamant with me that this was\nOnly to the good that they were presenting themselves she reading your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an\nArea where feminism has previously not been able to reach\nSo attached to explain what you mean by that I think this raising of demons that has been going on with the meat you era is allowing women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might call sexual assault or I might just called things I was extremely uncomfortable with and now going\nInto the future I Want to be treated differently in the bedroom I Want to be a split I Want I Want to be able to say no tonight and have that actually be heard I think that behavior always kind of lives behind attitude shift we're definitely in the ... now\nBut I truly believe that that kind of most private act is beginning to share\nBut
