enemy of the people and he suggested that the anger that led to the to violent incidents is caused by the hostility of the news media\nThe president has condemned the Pittsburgh attack in the mail

can get it what makes it profitable or the fees companies pay red had billions of dollars for support of their products the most famous one of them is Linux\nBut the farm also does a lot in cloud storage services all that is attractive to IBM\nWhich has been shifting away from hardware and try and do refreshing itself as a company providing cloud and other services to compete with Microsoft and Amazon\nIBM's purchase of red hat is not only the biggest IBM deal but also one of the biggest tech acquisitions in us history Alina Selyukh NPR News\nAnd opposition party in Bangladesh has called for nationwide protests Tuesday after one of its leaders and already jailed former prime minister was convicted of corruption again\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin behaving as if they are at war and they're going to take drastic action at the sort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration and the country is\nA huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country and politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about you know the the last posted Bowers wrote on gab is if you take out the last ...\nThe I'm going in that reads essentially like many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of posts on storm front do every day these are widely held ideas at white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants\nFirst is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justify drastic and violent action\nA President Trump has been calling himself a nationalist and some people are saying that's a really were for white nationalists and that's\n... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist and so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that I'm white national I feel like\nDonald Trump in some ways has been sort of winking at them and has been for\n... years now and in ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so you know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant\nThat Donald Trump would retweet a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact phrase white genocide would be spread dolls Donald Trump's followers I think similarly\nWhen Donald Trump sort of said that he was on a national ice than give it to defense for nationalism a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is signaling the U.S that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies with some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nSo the synagogue shooting rubber ... hours criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are said he's not a nationalist he's a globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish yes\nThe global is is it is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and a buzz word that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often that the final campaign ad of of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global is with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um\nYou know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world\nWhy because they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and\nYou know and it's interesting to read\nThese white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews either\nThis sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\nReally to blame is not necessarily the shooter and stuff but are are over with and Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get\nFrustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages but Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels small waves Gulf War and he wanders and how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek with central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popularize the movement to then somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for

media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement we'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could hold their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worse and don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did that I Do feel like that for wells your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nFor my plans for um\nIn on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organizer campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the low point was always to show that that could still work in the in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that brought the llama winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist ideas not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with their lives Derek like the only person then who ... who was thinking that thought that with Obama running for president and then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist have done a\nWith with dangerous effect is\nPlayed to the ... that factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that thirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or then juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away ah\nThings are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want the signs in Spanish that has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters then and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist racist you exactly right it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to this effect that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south and Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they would go into the parking lot and they would hand out these CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a\n... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line ...\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries is white genocide and would talk about white pride would talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language\nAnd I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language and rhetoric out of a white nationalism a white supremacy and yet Garrett you were describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nAt white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide\nAgainst you so it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or who are posting and the comments section\nAnd that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all\nThe immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is up\nIt ... percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at so which I think it's the core issue that um your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who's white because only a white person can be a member of storm front but there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition and even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post reported ... the author of a book about Jared black and white nationalism called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break this is fresh air\nYour donation to Houston Public media's fault
