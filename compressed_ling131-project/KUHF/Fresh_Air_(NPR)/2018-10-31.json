[noise]\nI'm rather young to go before the midterm elections in Trump rallies stays in power\nWe gave you the biggest that God in the history of God [noise]\nWill fat check the party and the candidates and our political satire [noise] next time [noise]\nGrowing\nUp today two pm on news eighty eight seven\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is David a capital and he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford the allegations of sexual assault and whether those justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices\nEven if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that they're all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\n[noise] I don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige I think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm\nPresident Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and front insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nPresidential campaign to confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks on Robert Robert in effect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush Gore how can anybody seriously question\nMy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not ... chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he's now\nAnd senator to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as that is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness and he's demonstrated at his greatest moment on the court in the Obamacare ruling\nHas he demonstrated it in any other moment\nNo [laughter] not really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating\nCampaign finance Citizens United and all that\nAnd removing a racial preferences from American Life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he firmly believes in the conservative agenda on those\nTwo issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential\nTo apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court further placed into the males drum in coming years now that it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and\nPlace them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that got at the voting rights act and that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise]\nUm so ... future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to the Supreme Court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous Zimmer arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act or Nineteen sixty five\nUm you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices but Congress passed a law\nAnd re upped the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic preference why is it um that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their ledge writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts has a high mark\nSaid John Roberts with the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what what's the difference is between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted to strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the ... Iraq being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because there were four justices on each side he knew he was the swing vote\nHe knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions\nLook like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in a close case decided\nI'm going to get the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter to strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\n[noise] if you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also the former legal affairs editor of Newsweek we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh ...\nHi I'm your homeowner I'm the president and CEO of NPR and I want to thank you for the incredible support you have shown Houston Public media local news coverage is disappearing across\nThe country for newspapers from television stations radio stations one of the few places that you can get local news is on public radio and that particularly holds true here in southeastern Texas so thank you so much for your support of Houston Public media news eighty eight seven [noise]\nMm support for NPR comes from this station and from logged me in makers of go to a meeting a collaborative meeting platform over Eighteen million monthly users\nDesigned to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more and go to meeting dot com\nAnd from west and hotels and resorts west and is committed to the wellbeing of travelers with offerings like heavenly bad a super foods Iraq's menu and gear lending Irwin workout gears left behind at home\nWest in la thrives learn more at West in dot com [noise] this is fresh\nAir and if you're just joining us I guess if David Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court\nAssault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek so we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a textural as I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch or Kavanaugh an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a um trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no causing the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights you say that originalism favor as\nA status quo fixing the Eighteenth century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions Laurel are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators I'm to use their own", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Houston", "day": "31"}
