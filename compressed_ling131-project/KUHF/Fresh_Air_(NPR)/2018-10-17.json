and I like that\nWell or on the subject of cheesy um horsing around the show that project starred in had a theme song\nAnd not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explain the premise of the show Shia and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song [noise]\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on Bo jak horsemen um till ... why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not ... theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of okay so you're just tuning in here is the premise of the show this is who these characters are this is how it works\nUm and it felt like a really fun way in like I thought if you heard the song you would immediately know what kind of show this is\nSince bow jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed you're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within a serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained\nThe premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nI you know I have seen a little Mr Right it is a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age\nIs that when I stayed home sick from school I didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have a bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience um and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right when [laughter]\nWhen Mr Ed goes home after senator and we really and that was a helpful way to think of that series\nThat's really funny if you're just joining us my guest is Rafi ...

written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia is birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her self cleaned up and she was to be the live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Bolivia and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the worst host of water\nBe careful moms have a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her and the network really juiced cliffhanger ... gone for good and\nOf course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rise from Mr T. alpha ... stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there's nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\n[noise] and actually saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt in trade they would say well Carmen is not a role model if you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funnier charming but I think middle school or high school me who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that\nMean to me and I think I Am also guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always thinking about\nWhat are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nI can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have\nThroughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and I think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs ... as I convinced myself that we were and thought that we were I Know some of those jokes\nIn the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I'm not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very ... character and we had a a gag where he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive\nAnd uh they're going to Alaska and he has a line or about what we're going to Alaska what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber monsters is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as now he doesn't realize and clearly the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke um but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself and I was watching your show\nAnd there is not a lot of representation for my people on television and to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurt\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some ... become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the right in the on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have in the first season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why do you get free by like oh this is my guest making my job harder yeah boom that's what happens in life sometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to learn how to take them\nAnd I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet\nI I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor\nBefore it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing and I think it is a challenge to to to challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for and I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that\nThen fine to make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be your audience you know I Want to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my comedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on\nIt it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me\nBecause my ego wants to say no it didn't you know because I Want to say well you know I I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions but I I think hearing that really helps me\nAnd I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive and more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my
