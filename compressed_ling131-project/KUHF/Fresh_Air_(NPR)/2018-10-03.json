you're saying oh but she has all the injections he sits in a collection room where he's you know expected to produce a sample\nUm and that's pretty demoralizing and then he has sperm blockage and has to go through some procedure it's off screen but that has to do with some kind of biopsies in his testicle I mean it they're they're getting it from both ends\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter]\nIt's like really cheap awful porn and it looks like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right yeah well they that's what they do that\nAlways such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and

conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself\nWhat would it mean for a child to really feel like your child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and a half of your partner and when it is taken away for some reason I think it's traumatizing at first and then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about giving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent\nUm what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or\nLike when people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and justice is always a tell us I was like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um egg donation is complicated ivy F is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just a job there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bed and say oh no why are you having sex right now to have a baby because there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um\nIt's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normalized and gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI shouldn't hang out with all the Hazaras\nHave had such a great way where they can get drunk in line bed and have sex and have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out\nAn unusual path to getting a child not the you know old fashioned way let's put it that way so I
