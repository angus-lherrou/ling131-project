you and the other comment that\nFirst line as originally performed was to what you're eating and standing up to the side of the stage that wasn't even acknowledging the crowd and it got to laugh and I go oh maybe that's the first bit that I should walk on stage\nSo that that sounds like it has a lot of truth behind it did you feel when you were growing up in Alabama like Confederate flags warrant you away from places and people that spell trouble\nYeah I think the difference between southern racism and northern racism is that in the south you know where you stand and there's\nI don't want to see a freedom and that but when you know where the boundaries are then you time to know how to play the game a little bit more so if someone's going to openly say\nI don't like you people and I'm going to hang a flag over my door to remind you I don't like you people then I Know not to eat at their business how much cleaner is that the me sitting there and getting bad service for an hour and a half\nComplaining to the manager and nothing happening ... which one is more tormenting it's more the Confederate flag is literally more convenient you save me Ninety minutes\nDid you see a lot of Confederate flags growing up in Alabama\n[noise] um yeah but I also started as a comedian my first nine years of comedy from Ninety eight until I moved to Los Angeles you know I was a southern and mid west that so you know I did a lot of shows and a lot of strange places\nA lot of arm pits [laughter] if you will a beautiful places sometimes questionable people so I've seen Confederate flags on you know and and\nI don't want to say it doesn't bother me because you know it's\nStruggling to think why someone has the flat you know but it it doesn't scare me\nIn that sense you say you performed\nIn strange places did you ever perform at a bar or a club that had a Confederate flag\nAbsolutely I've been called the N word from the stage by somebody in the crowd and the club owner did nothing to defend me so\nThere's definitely been questionable situations but at the end of the day\nGive me my fifty dollars that I drove nine hours to get paid [laughter] so I can be on my way back to Birmingham cities like that traditionally uh my protocols to never stay at the hotel that the thing you provide it\nSo I Need to sleep in my car or our state of you know I Would drive three or four hours out of town like I was split the drive that night and just drive half way back to Birmingham and then sleep somewhere else because I just felt like\nIn those towns if I'm One of the few black people now you're telling a joke and you know ha ha ha it's all fun and games but to some people there it didn't again you know there's a level of respect you have to have someone who's bold enough to say that they don't like you and that they'll call you one of the most hated words in the history of this country\nSomebody like that might be motivated to come find you have to show\nAnd I'm the only person in town but Alabama plate so yeah get the hell out of there and you know thankfully every gig wasn't like that but I'm thankful for those gigs so you know it's if nothing more my first Nineteen years of comedy which is I'm\nA very very bitter education or and or the psyche of the middle\nUh is Trevor Trevor in his people you know I at the time before Daily Show I'd been doing um I'd come up with a sitcom on TBS Sullivan and soon we got cancelled and so for the following year\nI was doing most of my TV appearances would guess rolls on ESPN on the you know various shows on their on their family networks so a lot of what you do on ESPN as a comedian isn't that different from the Daily Show you take the day's news\nAnd you find the punch lines and it's even more difficult and ESPN because\nYou can't offend sponsors and athletes in teams and like there's just this more potholes and to me to humor with sports versus politics politics it's all in the game you can go after anybody but it's much more manicured delicate way of making jokes in the sports around that I\nGuess I did well enough from that to catch somebody's out on Trevor side and that I got the call for the audition and six days later I was in New York City\nThat's the other thing they don't tell you about the Daily Show that when you're hired is like yeah you starting now like what my stuff's in California yeah that's cool they hire people but you start now we need your now\nMy guest is comic Roy would junior he's a correspondent on the Daily Show we'll hear more of the interview after a break during which I

Herrera located in river oaks and post out at boulevard place more at I gallery Houston dot com\nYou don't see often from black artist would you do see them talk about specific cities and sing the praises\nOf a specific city which make me laugh when I got to living in America\nBecause that is a patriotic song that is celebrating some of what's great about this country but I'd be damned of at the very end of the song James Brown start naming specific city [laughter] New Orleans be joy ... ... ... ...\nWhat was the music you grew up with a I grew up with my mother playing beyond war on Saturday mornings on an eight track and uh my neighbors would beep off in the blues and so they would open their windows and you know it in Saturday's in the south that's you know that's cleaning day\nSo I'm even here in the um Oregon Diana Ross and Ross\nBut for my mom's house or through my window the Lee family next door I could hear fats domino and you know some of the deeper southern blue stuff\nCan I ask you about the ...\nIf your parents work and I think it for a living\nOr so I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama\nUh\nOn the west side the neighborhood is called west in ZIP Code three five to eleven one of the worst of the votes in the city in terms of crime statistics at the time [noise]\nA pretty rough neighborhood on the back side of the crack Arab ... we moved in the west in on the back end of white flight so in the eighties we had a couple of white neighbors but you know by the early nineties and you know\nCrack it really taking over a it was pretty much an all black neighborhood the one thing I've kind of joked about sometimes but it's actually true is that\nIf you're going to living gain territory it behooves you to live deep\nIn gang territory because where I Lived in Birmingham\nMost of the shootings were happening where territory's met like on the border lines almost so there are a lot of bad people but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirts areas in relation to where I Lived\nDid you ever had are joining a gang\nNo I you know my mom\nMy parents were separated until I was in the third grade so when my parents reaching filed and we moved to burn a mother and I left Memphis and went to Birmingham [noise] you know taking piano lessons I was playing baseball I was in gifted courses\nYou know what I was when I put on punishment and my mom would take my video games from me I read encyclopedias\nJust you know I really out of lack of better options but you know I was always a brainy kid I had leg goes and you know in gangs tend to benefit people that are type a personalities are people who strive to be\nA type a personality I was very aware of gangs\nThere was a housing complex South Park projects and they just built a new library in the commercial district on the other side of the projects in the library had computer classes and my mom wanted me to take computer classes so\nThe quickest way to the library was to cut through the projects and sometimes that got picked on and yeah and then there were days why didn't feel like being bother with that so you would have to walk around the south park project to get home which is a forty five minute detour\nAnd then you get home and your mom does where you began which you've been out and so now you're didn't accused of being out doing bad things when in actuality we're voting them but you know you can explain that\nTo people with the saving grace for me\nWas that my parents are bought me\nA really nice basketball goal and there's a park up the street from my house called powder Lee park\nAnd probably park had all the you know as it was in municipal city park\nAnd they had all the hoops and you know it'd be bank is out there and proudly part sat on the edge of gangs to disciple and vice low territory so sometimes it would go down so my mom didn't really want me around that element so I and I've never talked with her about this\nBut my guess is that her ideology was it the boy like shooting basketball let's put a basketball hoop in the yard and that way he won't be it probably park if something goes down and [noise] it it's just I don't know if his fate or what man but\nWe had a house one of the few houses in a neighborhood with a two car garage which meant the way the goal was set up you could play almost half court if you played off into the ... on the driveway\nSo we basically had half court and we had the best basketball go with a breakaway ram because of the city park the goals always break because they're arrested and crush DNA replace them with other rusty and crusty brands so all the gangbangers came to our house to shoot hoops ...\nUnauthorized immigrants that come into play basketball but\nSo then you ask me what my father did and how it ties in okay my father was a radio personality in the city and highly respected my dad was a civil rights journalist back in the sixties and seventies he was embedded in any\nAny march you can find me for the job I'm sure my dad is no more than two or three steps behind Dr King covering the march\nMy dad did morning news on the radio my father was the voice of the city of Birmingham for very long time his name rank out and out of respect to my father\nGuys will lead guns around the corner they will leave the liquor up the street\nAnd when they came to our house ... Switzerland\nSo you might feel vice lord and against a disciple you it's it's it's plausible and there's no drama out of respect to my father my mom because my mom also didn't take no smack on anybody and I think there's something to showing kids you know and my mom would bring ice water out she was nice so\nI grew up in a bad neighborhood but I had a lot of guts out a lot of circumstances in my favor that kept me on the side of the wrong people\nMy guess is right would junior a correspondent on the Daily Show we'll be right back at first I Want to take a moment to urge you to support this station when it comes to news\nAnd popular culture nothing on the radio some past hit the debt and breath of public rainy out they can do that kind of programming only because he you support and thank you [noise]\nAnd the way you support is it by calling AAA nine nine zero eight seven or go on line to Houston Public media dot org it's eleven forty\nSupport for Houston Public media comes from signature care emergency center's offering twenty four hour adult and pediatric emergency care including imaging see the skin in labs services at five Houston area locations details that E R here twenty four dot com [noise]\nAnd your part time controller helping nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting and financial reporting needs your part time controller the nonprofit accounting specialists more at your part-time controller dot com [noise]\nDoron may use CPAs and advisors with tax accounting audit cybersecurity and more serving all sectors including emergency services construction international and manufacturing for a D.
