can to express themselves in a way we're like well it would be really do hope no pun intended but it'd be really up to not only have a show that sort of ... showcases\nYou know my improv injustice improv abilities both singular and together but also use the shows a platform to just bring our friends along it'd be like we're supporting everybody this is a show for everybody if you are funny there's no reason why you're not going to be on the show and I think a lot of times you would just here you know\nAnd the industry oh they're just like our desert Ernie funny black women are we just don't know where to look and I'm like\nThat ... me where there are so many talented amazing people and if you're not ... it's either out of laziness or the fact that you really don't care\n[noise] so you're pretty successful now in comedy and with your podcast and HBO specials of to do queens but for years you made next to nothing as a comment yes\nYes and and you were getting like dining calls from the student loans that you owed you were nearly evicted from your apartment but you were given a reprieve of like several weeks or a couple of months to raise the\nFive thousand dollars that you needed to stay in your apartment how did you handle the anxiety\nOf not being able to pay your student loans and then not being able to afford to have an apartment and nearly beings I said\nYeah you know there are a lot of tears just like not being able to sleep at night there's a lot of feeling like a failure of feeling like\nMaybe me trying to pursue comedy's a little nutty because I really didn't start making a really solid living doing comedy until eight and a half years and and um\nYou know I was kind of like well maybe it shouldn't take this long\nThere are other people around me where it's like it's not taking them eight years to sort of like you know get their career going the way they want to and you know looking back on and now I'm just kind of like you can't control when that happens I think yes it was kind of irritating that it took me this long but I think I was\nSo fully ready for the opportunities that arose by that point so like you know to to queens being a HBO didn't scare me\nHaving to write a book didn't scare me it's like a cabin blogging in writing for three four years making what fifty bucks a blog post okay yeah I can just writing this book is going to be hard but I'm not going to run away from it\nLet me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is comic an actor Phoebe Robinson who hosts the podcast and HBO specials to do queens

but are there are kind of casting calls were you know that they are not there definitely like not entertaining idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language\nThat you can see when a black person would even conceivably be cast in the world\nLead [laughter] you're like oh so that leads going to be ... called [laughter] okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool cool I got that you want me to sound like this okay I'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I you know when I started acting like pretty recently\nI had to have a

that's not the part for me\nUm you know I think the language in it or a casting call is like\nAll American is white beautiful but doesn't know it is white\nUh and then usually it will be like open to all ethnicities is when you know that that is oh that's a role that so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules should be open to ethnicity\nDo you know what I mean like there there is no reason why it took you know twenty some odd years for that it'd be crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that\nThey could have been leads and romantic comedies
