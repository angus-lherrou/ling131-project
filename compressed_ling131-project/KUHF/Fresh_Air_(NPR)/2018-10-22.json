court decision and an even where the court differed you know where they're where the the appellate court invalidated some of the prescriptions of the lower court\nIt's pretty clear the evidence was very a damning in terms of what a kids had suffered in care so\nI suspect legislators and the state will move forward also with some of the issues that may not be constitutional violations but nonetheless are really important and these include\nReducing the number of kids in sort of group facilities and prioritizing more family like settings where kids do better\nUm and ensuring that kids transitioning out of care have the skills and supports they need to succeed once they're on their own and in both of those areas the state has actually been making progress over time and so I suspect

I don't know if you're still does us but you're saying in subways she does she showed us yeah gosh and she would often take you and you were a kid and you'd\nBe doing what was she was saying on so she was a teacher\nA she was he drove my school of until the fourth grade she went on sabbatical and started seeing the subway and found that she made more money seems so ... and she did a working for the board of education and so I'm ... years or so well paid yeah [laughter] me too much money [noise]\nUm my mom would take my brother and I down to the subway while she's saying she'd saying you know\nFive hours or so and I would sit on the bench either like somewhere in eyesight or definitely an ear shot or something and I would do my homework or I Would read books um Penn Station in New York City my mom would perform there and there was a bookstore\nA nearby and so I Would just wander around this huge train station\nAnd I would go and sit down at a bookstore and I think that they knew my mom because they would just let me pull a book off the shelves and read it without paying for it and then every now and then I'd ask for money I really need this new clue book or I really need this new Nancy Drew\nI'm I have money to buy it and she would always give I she made sure that I was always\nI'm able to bury my nose deep at all\nAnd he thought he had to be really strict um on us because we were living in that side\nYou know he lived in a part of Africa where his you know his father was the mayor and you know they would leave the doors open at night just wide open at night he lived in a safe place and we moved his family and we we were living in a very unsafe place and he thought that discipline was um\nWas part of keeping us safe and it was like there I I wrote a story that got edited out about how um\nHe would let me go get the mail just because I needed some independence and I was like six years old I was four something maybe and my brother had so much independence who was only eleven months older than me but I if I wanted to go check the mail\nHe would walk to the door and the he would watch me walk down the hallway and the elevator was around he'd tell me don't give them the staircase do not get in the staircase\nEven if it was three floors don't give them as their case because bad things can happen to girls and the staircase and he would wait for me to get on the elevator I'd have to tell him I'm In the elevator 'cause he couldn't\nSee me I'd have to yeah I mean and this and then I go down and he'd give me he's like you have one minute don't go anywhere I'm counting one minute and he's very starting in this way and then I get the mail and I'm hurry and I get back in the elevator 'cause I'm not allowed to take the stairs and as soon as the elevator opened on the third floor I'd have to yeah\nSo that he can hear me and then he's like okay come but like that with him he was very stern but he had to keep me safe because a little girl like me was not safe in the building that we lived in\nSo another thing about your father which you write about a lot in the book\nIs that in Senegal where he's from there still are at least I was then polygamy\nAnd your father unbeknownst to you and your mother until it became known [laughter] a had a relationship with another woman who has a cousin who he also married and they had a child together and that in the end of your parents' marriage yet\nSo we're pretty astonished when you found out\nYeah I was pretty surprised um but also not at all surprised because I knew that that was part of um the Senegalese man practice my grandfather had several lives in several families\nAnd I my chest would close up that had [laughter]\nThat would really feel kind of like I was dying like I Can't believe this comment you calling me a fat so it's going to kill me right now why am I dying and that wasn't into fourth grade for sure and that's when I started\nTo pray okay [noise] Hugh cried from history\nThrough math and to a gym\nYou cried for three hours today we can't do this anymore we can't cry for three hours and you know that tomorrow it's going to call you a fat so again and you know it's going to make you cry so please don't cry [noise]\nInside pray to God that that I could be like I just thought it was being sensitive because that's what people told me oh you're just a baby you're being\nYou're being too sensitive you're taking things to heart too much and I thought that that's what it was nobody noticed that I was actually having a medical condition and I was having like I was dealing with a mental\nIt's harder as dealing with depression and anxiety and nobody noticed\nAnd it continued through elementary continued through junior high continued in in high school I notice that it was they were more prevalent on the way to school\nAnd so I switched schools and it it happened even more and I think this is tied to being called fat anymore there's something else going on and that's when I went to adopt and said something\nI realize while writing it wow is that why was crying so much that when my chest with close up and feel like my heart was beating too that I was having a panic attack at nine years old and nobody saw me and I remember my teacher Mr ... who was really sexy\nHe's my um science teacher and my home when teacher my mom came to school for like teachers night or whatever and he has a so she's great and she's really smart and she's really funny and everybody likes her but if somebody says something about her she started to cry and cry for too long\nAnd he likes said she cries for too long as if I\nCould do something about it I could not your head and you're crying in my opinion is when you're a parent or an adult says\nStop crying it's like you know you're not controlling it it's it's an involuntary response you don't want to be crying as early as you're being criticized for doing something out of your control which makes you crime or I even more to do that I might have control of these emotions fan I'm not I'm not\nI don't want to I'm embarrassed I don't want to be doing this yeah well here's the thing I'm thinking like if you cry for three different periods\nIn school like when you're a kid and you're crying that is like major Lee embarrassing so to add to the panic effort to the discomfort to add to the feeling that you're being shamed you're crying which is just going to lead to more shaming so that must have been\nAwful to be a little worse it was like a cycle that I couldn't get out of and you know with kids don't like they're not nice of you because you cry and not know they know where to get you they know what the thing will what was the thing to say is they know how they want you to cry\n[laughter] so what stopped the cycle for you said you you went into therapy ... um what helped you stop that cycle of depression and panic [noise] [noise]\nI think one the first thing was being allowed to know be able to call it depression being able to call it an anxiety um was the first step and I cannot tell you how many people\nTold me that I wasn't feeling when I was feeling\nThat I was kind of cheer up type of thing things are here up as a file fine you know tomorrow will be another day\nA year just feeling gloomy whatever or you know you need to go to church and you know take this to Jesus and it's\nYou know I wasn't allowed to be depressed because you know like I said people see everything through a filter of them of their own selves and so being allowed to call it that and being allowed to go and fix it\nWas everything and you know who gave me that allowance I did\nI had to give it to myself that I looked around and I realize you know I have parents and I have family and certainly and people that care about me but they don't see me\nThey don't see how I Can't fall asleep at night because my mind is racing I have a therapist the last line of my book is a shout out to my parents [laughter]\nUm and she's she's a really special she's she's really really special I'm so glad I found her but it's really just a shout out to therapy in general [noise] get therapy\nI guess does

America through Mexico and that story and the number of shift and and the the details shift in sometimes it's hard\nTo keep up with what's happening in the news because things change so quickly and
