influence\nForward with an increase in the federal minimum\nWill throw hopeful other large employers to fall off and increase their minimum wages as well\nThey made the move because they think the national minimum wage of seven twenty five is too low and Clark says this increase will have a significant impact on Amazon employees and their families Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters\nIn Germany chancellor ongoing Merkel's government says agreed on the details of a proposed new immigration law that's modeled on the Canadian system as may Nicholson reports the law intends to make it easier for skilled workers to get visas while preventing immigration for those who are unskilled\nThe proposed legislation renews ... highly qualified known emu citizens with\nGerman language skills the bill is a response to Gemini skilled labor shortage\nWell you know it's funny because the broad impulse so the Trump Administration has been just knocked to fill the jobs I mean the top seven hundred jobs in the administration\nHalf of them are still unfilled and the ones that are filled are filled often very oddly by people who don't have the expertise for the job so I Would say the broader pattern is one of just general neglected misunderstanding\n... there's no question that Trump has been specifically hostile to environmental regulation\nAnd to the idea of climate change and it's pretty clear that the reason he's off the oil is he's got he's backed by by fossil fuels people um and where you do find places in ... in in my stories where\nWhere you can see the hand that handed work either removing climate change data from websites are filling jobs that would be specifically addressing\nClimate and the environment with people who are totally inappropriate for the job so for example ah in the agriculture department the chief scientist the person who's in charge of distributing the three billion dollars a year the agriculture department distributes to for basic research\nThis research is done is done now almost entirely to find ways to adapt the food supply to climate change um I mean it's it's ... it's absolutely critical is not going to be done in the private sector they head of his job to a right wing talk show radio host or who had backed trumping I\nMean it's just that kind of thing is going on throughout the administration\n[noise] you had spoken ... about a year ago after your second article on how Trump is running the federal government was published in Vanity Fair and and with Davey focused on the departments of energy and agriculture you've added in your book the department of commerce and want to take a look at that\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce has very little to do with directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day that collects all of a sudden we're able to parse the data and wait and use the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly something that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department will Ross is not interested in ... he sees the job is kind of like cheap trade negotiator which is odd because we have achieved trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pool that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census and the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on census um\nI don't know if there's a definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen census whether it's on there and while they're still is still argument about whether they go\nEnergy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're gonna take a short break and

you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money by the big short and the undoing project olive which had been best sellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nYou know I'm On and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nIt's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not really had a prize the side of it we don't say doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nAbuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nAnd not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually I think a quite good transition they add hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government for their ... the Obama administration is so the bottom of Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefing this you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with the ... virus so if you have another pet\nImage or through a threat of pandemic here's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\nThis is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told him to\nAnd the jak cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey had put Kushner's father in jail but that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion there and there's also no reason you couldn't just just fired Christian kept everybody else on board\nI think what happened was that a number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs and the government\nAnd they were left off the list because the transition timid vet it all these people and found problems with them so some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded truck to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened and a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a unit terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do what they didn't have any choice Trump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being spent\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his

departments\nAfter President Trump was inaugurated he sent in what you just got this small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the part of energy had the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the ... landing team with ... Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the question\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts\nThe department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of ...\nFind a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in\nAnd approach the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poisons the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of intimacy showed you the people don't really feel this\nAnd that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "02"}
