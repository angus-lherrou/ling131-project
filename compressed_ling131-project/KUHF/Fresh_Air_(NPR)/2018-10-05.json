it's it's a shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point when I saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so what [laughter] bother to hide it\nBut but still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your
