NPR News New York\nUm and like I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nI think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and\nPaper a and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to\nYou know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about disappeared in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you're trying to raise kids you know in Neal's case to\nYou know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total ... the in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash and clean the pool and help make us gets breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that it this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nDocs with the fuel spacecraft in space the first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything said like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with that's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control\nAnd he's just kind of spinning and tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes\nWhere you can just experience\nThe the ... the extremes\nOf being I'm In space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a ... right so why don't you talk about the spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\n\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the gym night mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like ah like royalty as they should and right away\nScience only shaking so that it looks real and so he's really experiencing all of the uh ... and and just physical jostling I'm On this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody fell out of it in question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nDo what did we ain't getting ... from we react to\nTake a we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second because rice that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking\n'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and kicking the capital of the bat that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nI'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLow key way without really that really showing emotion\nI mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family I'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was\nBy trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who uh\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and uh actually sitting down and facing them uh uh you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hearse\nMichele through the atmosphere and fly into devoid of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear except for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the\nGround [noise] um congestion her which did the score\nFor the film and you also work with him on whiplash another land you met in college and\nI think the music is really good for the film and um I Know music is very important to you\nGearing to the moon landing sequence um there's music that chance to me like part military part like western theme music and you Star Trek refer to space as the final frontier [laughter]\nSo I don't actually intentional to have a kind of western an edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military ... kinda galloping like horses and a western\n[noise] ah well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflect Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kind of get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves to the inner confidence when you are\nYeah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio between the capsule and kept calm and mission control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you're listening to all of it online and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to ah was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone had come too far that points to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know sort of felt like a music wise that we could get into Neal's mine space that we can get into that sense of just relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would be fit to see\nOK let's hear some of that music and this is ... music\nFrom the score for first man [noise]\n... landing music fan just inherently to score\nFor first man and a movie about Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\nThey're saying that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera ...\nAn excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication the Daily Caller\nThis is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that they're planning on the front which not shown he was asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of they tell me it's like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon\nYou think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he'd have to think that people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about ... and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much be motions that something like that or get aroused think ah obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking up the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely a steady choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater\nDuring which point he is spent time alone away from many cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk but no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was\nProduct of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers that was something that was incredibly important for us to show and that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nSupport
