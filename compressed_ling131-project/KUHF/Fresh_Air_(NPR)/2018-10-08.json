still suspect that there is a nefarious reason why they were so committed to this nominee and Ernest tourists as the Supreme Court judge should choose sides and apparently he has picked aside I think referring there\nTo the uh the highly sort of partisan remark that he made when he was called back in front of the Senate Judiciary committee talking about The Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and

I think you've said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with him I mean you ... like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins and pages and\nIn his pocket you found a notebook in the freezer once um so what what are you dealing with the findings\nWell it's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a from the simplest point of view there's the are the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity then there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book\nUm and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I ah I produced his last record the\nCold you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red sometimes to a mere kick drum you know just for a meter for tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father and then it was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on hand and this is it's like and I say it's a great song [noise]\n\nIf you she means [noise] if the scientists or his mind because you want to start [noise] [noise]\n\nAh I was\nIn the human brain\nTo eight early detection all women over the age of forty should undergo routine screenings like nearly mammograms more at Texas oncology dot com\nIs is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard Collins final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this poems I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to\nUm to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes there was just really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nIt was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version short\n[laughter] this is Leonard come yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right is that fleet transgression yet yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because [noise]\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know or be give some other songs a chance to get played [noise] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song [noise] so in spite of\nThe moratorium your family has an hallelujah I think I think we'll play it anyway\nI'm okay with that oh God I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter]\nOkay I hear it\n[noise]\n\nReally\nDo [noise]\nCall a manager of\n[noise]\nThat's ... singing hallelujah and my guest is when it comes on Adam cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion immensely published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people that recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the uh the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nUh he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like she had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this unexpected\nAbility to fill you know twenty thousand seats and in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know just give 'em like they were reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and to see him take his hat off you know and I think we jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in my life when\nI saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue [laughter]\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and she sings a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoying a solitude and I felt like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone and joy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude and so I made a blood ... actually the the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful\nWell this is a man who as he says and I think you've you've just played it well you know although we had a reputation as a ladies' man you know he was he had the greatest teeth to ten thousand nights you spent alone he understood something about solitude\nLet me re introduce you if
