constitution provides and expressed road map for you know changing\nThe meaning of the citizenship clause and so I think you know it'd be a lot more convincing\nIf instead of staying he's going to do this ... to order the president actually took the you know legally appropriate step of proposing a constitutional amendment that would change the language of sex and one of the fourteenth amendment

parents aren't in green card mode there shouldn't be any automatic citizenship [noise]\nYou know every few years it seems like this issue of birthright citizenship flares I guess when a commentator said briefly but brightly a and we see a lot of news articles and I don't think we've heard the last of this conversation even if the president doesn't move forward I think we're going to see a lot more commentary built around this uh this idea\nAnd decidedly selling one last interesting perspective here from Leah Keith on her Facebook page\nShe notes that the president may not be thinking about the thousands of service members serving overseas that this could affect birthright citizenship citizenship works both ways not only for those people born here but also for those born to us or citizen serving around the world and interesting prescription errors\nYeah or you know it's interesting a there's a group I'm a ... is co migration policy they they ah they publish a I Believe this is the

becoming great actors and becoming these characters and learning this screenplay and for me it took three years in twenty draft you deliberately right every I'm In like an expletive\nWithin reason behind it well really and uh-huh and that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue\nThat seems improvise is a complement to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought and how these people speak to one another\n[noise] did you learn to speak that way [noise]\nYes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express your feelings are you express that something hurts you then you should be made fun of\nAnd that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nBut the thing is like you or\nAs a child and then as a young teen you were writing like skips for The Simpsons I'm\nNot on a professional ... you were just like writing for The Simpsons so you I only had both ambition\nAnd also a a facility for words you lived in the world the words you wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking what must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes\nReferring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time feel like but you're not supposed to express yourself\nBecause you're a boy yeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend of course yeah ... adolescent\nYou you were kind of suppressing something that came really natural to you that you really valued\nRight and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own and security as a person and I as a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life uh after\nJust brother person uncle and stuff like that first occupation I Would lift it would be a writer\nAnd then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked and then on top of that\nYou know even when I became a well known public figure I think the duality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff\nAllowed for jokes and punches to be made about me and towards me which turned me angry here which made me communicate worse and then when you're funny\nYou become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to

all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early\nScratch here's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nActually the caffeine or dry hired a mid nineties Alison Jones is judge casting director and that's why I hired her for my first film because she she's the one who introduced me to judge I after I did I heard how could these I met some casting directors because uh\nYou know I got like an aging off of that and then ... and brought me into read for that little one line and four year old virgin and I don't know then I stuck around\nSo there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about this line fits are so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to gas line I'm gonna ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] you're you're you're a high school kid and this and you know you're not part of the cool crowd at all\nOh and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series MANIAC I love her yeah I ... from a distance I Love her to [laughter]\nFrom the decision of a job he has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nA about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say\nYou know how girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that\nGuy we could be that mistake so gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about ... teenage boys an adult men try to get girls and women trunk or drug to get them into bad\nI mean it's literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping\nWith him and that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times change that was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you awful [laughter]\nBut it ... it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I not that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity to understand that\nThose words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience\nSo now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise]\nSo um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I ... I think things have changed\nYet I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] why don't we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter he's directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back\nThis is fresh air\nElection day is November six but the midterms are already here with control of the U.S house and Senate\nHanging in the balance early voting is going on right now and in the newsroom rotting November struck in\nTouch with standard in public radio stations across the Lone Star state\nAre trying to make sense of mid term elections through our Texas decides fraud\nOr move around from Texas standards you can visit our interactive voter gun right now\nAt Texas decides dot ORG\nMhm\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from YouTube originals and roadside attraction presenting cyber club starring Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free her captured journalists son\nAlso starting met boomer and ... in theaters friday\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros\nAnd book appointments on line at home advisor dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and it's set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in\nYour early twenties yeah and and now it like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years instead of playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John she ... she told me and then in Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine\nHad talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me money ball and then in the end\nI'm a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then\nUh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had\nA lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like well things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't you\nHear a scene from a loaf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny aids off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene\nWhile for your for your for civil affairs for little kids right was it [laughter]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "30"}
