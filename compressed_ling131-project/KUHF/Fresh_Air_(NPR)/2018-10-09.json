Wonder if we will get a pandemic along with drastic climate change to drastically altered the earth and change the balance of power there's no question that the earth will survive that man's life\nAnd

allegedly notion about yeah it's like a do dire pronouncements sort of help because right on that change or do they are of combating climate change or do they do not have to sort of\nFabulous more serious point right I mean if if people already have a fatalistic attitude about it then where is the political pressure going to come from because as a professor hey I was just discussing it if you don't have that political will I mean that's nearly a with\nAnd I don't think yeah you definitely you definitely don't see that currently well speaking of the current political regime Nikki Haley is trending after her announcement that she has resigned\nAs US ambassador to the United nations and will be leaving her post at the end of the year I've seen a lot of she's running jokes on Twitter but she says she has no twenty twenty planned rather she says this was her plan all along to hold the post for two or so years then stepped down so Trump says he will name a successor to Haley within the next two to three weeks maybe sooner\nMaking Bronson says what's everyone's saying she tweets there's an eighty percent chance this weekend's with Kanye West replacing Nikki Haley as UN ambassador I guess we can dream it's not like we've been really wanting for slow news days anyway but\nThen that's evident leisure true you know a recall that Nikki Haley had said back when there was this anonymous ah insider and the Trump White house who did write op ed in the New York times\n... at the time she was saying that is no way to to act and so on and so forth of I had any problems with the Trump Administration I Would take them directly resident so I guess a lot of people also wondering what she said to the president when she broke the news that she was going to be leaving what history what sort of a if there is in fact any rift or any uh yeah\nI mean she said she was going to campaign for him and it was all smiles and glad hands in the press conference that they had together so I guess\nIt was we shall see also you know here's a couple interesting and training terms today tough is Texas is trending and Richard Link later is trending too I don't know if you could know of where I'm going with I think I might\nDoes this have to do with the film that link leaders put together\nA little campaign ad yes the links later unveiled a campaign commercial attacking bad campaign slogan

Carl Davis this actor describing the different portions of Texas guy in a diner right a colorful language will link leader team to back up with a bad actors Sunday Carl Davis a worthy speaking of tough you have some tough words\nFor Ted Cruz and the attacks that personal attacks with Donald Trump made on him during the GOP primary\nUm use some colorful language somehow probably\nShould get in

P. H.\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you're right that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to the subject or virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but isn't what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out information about what have been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered then Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operate as these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see in all future conflicts\n... just to be sure we understand that we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get them to social media platform like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes one of the challenges in space is that\nUh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account\nWho are posing as something that they're not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg who's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from\nAccess but then you have\nAlso bought ... these are machines these algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter\nGet rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically\nRegenerate and what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that the Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing\nIs creating accounts and having them lie dormant and have a a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road you'll be much harder to detect that as something other than a real person\nYou cite an amazing number here he said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is that ... out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior\nMaybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts these were in essence fake followers\nCreated to give the semblance of a massive on line following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically uh bought accounts\nGenerated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost think of like a sweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or banquet dash\nAnd then you combine these physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but an extent the campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nOr it now belatedly says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um tendency GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to use all similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to er there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing but the echo effect and to the broader population including the media itself\nOne of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether it swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and social media ...
