I did you know as children children were were were always part of what was happening it wasn't like up with the children away you know you were just part of life\nAnd uh yes when they picked up the big you know the usually grandpa and some other\nKind of neighbors pick up the big each one by one of the the legs and brought it up on this plank of course that was really whatever we knew the time was coming to us kids would run and hide and then of course we've come back out and peak and see what's going on and then run again\nAnd uh but inevitably you know a ... we saw we saw the ... the big actually being kind of ... and uh whatever followed the fact that you know the blood was first elected and a\nGrandmother wouldn't have pale ... pale would right away collect as much as she could of the blood they even sort of turned to the pig around so that the\nThe actual exit of the blood would be on top of the pale and are slowly allow all of the blood to drain out a pig and you know that became blood sausages and now even as a child a\nLakers named cook the your your grandmother would like to cook the blood and then put a lot of the reasons you not some things in it that too many facts how much\nCorn meal sometimes rise to kind of ... and it would be this kind of savory sweet a mixture and then when the mixture became something like ... the you know nice and then with everything in it\nOr the season the ... river little solved by then uh the big had been a opened and and butchered in a sense of the peace has been testing was where the block sausage would go and\nBy the way I'm going to stop you because part of your job was cleaning out the intestine so that could be used for for ... that must have been an unpleasant job\nWell it was it that it will say you know not the children always are just kind of the the women was the woman's job you know one of the first thing saying was very carefully done because you don't want to puncture the intestines and and have all the inside of the intestine so that sort of are they just the pieces all of that\nA president or yes the borough steep though and you know the kind of one for all communism or a\nDoctor and if you well\nYou know everything became a mural farms were taken away my my father had a business with the two trucks\nAnd he certainly was deemed a capitalist the trucks were taken away he was the input in prison for about forty days until they clarify that he didn't have other\nAlternatives motives of you know kind of undermining this time in this stick a dogma that he wanted you know to profess capitalism and so on so it was it was a tough tough period and and that's why I'm we ended up spending a lot of time\nIn ... with my grandmother and in in the court yet which for me was I deal like\n... and that was in part because in the countryside in this village where she live there wasn't patrolled by the secret police like the city where your parents were less ... ...\nYes exactly you know I mean one main road and the houses on each side everybody knew each other everybody had a little plot of land that tell us quite small\nMy guest is Lydia ... host of the PBS show Libya's kitchen

you I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nYou're listening on news eighty seven I'm Travis ... thanks for being with us this morning\nTo give you an update on what's happening here this week of Houston Public media we're inviting you to take part in an experiment they were trying to\nCut this day a fund raising in half the idea here is to raise all the money we'd normally raised in a day by noon today and we're working on it if we do have the rest of the day fundraiser free\nIt's like buying back half of their programming with one pledge with me today is guild do water Gail we're working on that goal and making some progress we\nAre but we still have a ways to go about sixty one thousand dollars and Houston that's doable we can do it we've got people on the line right now pitching in to made negative success and to really make it fast we've got to have you coming in on our efforts as well\nAnd ah my mother was given an opportunity by a family a woman that had an artistic child and she wanted\nMy mother's a teacher to spend some time and teach and talk to the child and intern she she subsidized my schooling in the convent that was actually right close to her house and then that comment I was a I just loved it because it began to sort of interact with other children speak Italian\nAnd the religion came back in my life the nuns uh\nTook me under their wings knowing that I was a child that you know have not been\nEducated in their religion and in our religion because of being under communism so it was a great a setting for me and also to sort of help subsidize my schooling they put me in the kitchen I don't know why but I guess they sense you know in the kitchen was more of what I did with grandma you know kind of appeal\nSee those apples but it was for me the first kind of entree into a commercial kitchen seeing this big pots did they were cooking lunch for all of the\nStudents and for the nuns so it was fun to kind of being the kitchen help the nuns and I even felt kind of special that I was\nThe ... even though it was an immigrant that I was the child that they chose to put it in the kitchen\nSo I imagine you learn things that you could later apply in a restaurant\nI yes actually built the base uh but you know what I think really ... and in retrospect thinking back um about my passion of food my\nWhy am I so connected to food ... why it goes back I think too when I realized that I you know I'm not going back to grammar I'm not going back to ... and for me it was a you know unfinished business I didn't say goodbye to grandma didn't say goodbye to my animals and then say goodbye to\nTo my friends and I'm\nSlowly food became the substitute the connector I Would cook foods that grandma\nCook to you know even if it was a simple is pulling the in milk in the morning which were usually our breakfast\nAh those those flavors those those those aromas abrupt grandma back to me and you know I continued to cook with with this this kind of desire to connect and to remain connected\nSo I'm In Nineteen fifty eight you and your family immigrate to America\nWith the help of Catholic Relief services and Catholic Relief services emerges as a real hero of this book in your life story\nThey helped you get passage to America they found you a hotel room to stay in when you first arrived they found a house or apartment for you to rent afterwards they helped her parents find jobs they gave him money and they didn't want to be repaid even though your mother insisted on paying them they wouldn't accept it [noise]\nUm but anyway so you were how old when you came to America to us I was from Nineteen fifty eight didn't speak any English that you learned it within a year\nAnd then you were in school being yes like an outsider newcomer without any facility with English and always I imagine pretty hard for you and you still had to deal with food but with food in a foreign country with very little money and\nNo garden or animals or you know fruit trees or [laughter] any vet to deal with so how did the world of food change for you in a matter of\nWell each each changed tremendously you're not twelve years old though you are or at least I recall being\nVery very I was happy I was so happy that finally we came up to a place where we're going to stay we are going to build their home and ah I'm I was excited about learning the language of excited about becoming an American I was excited about making friends\nUh you know whose language I Know and I was excited also by the food ah you know I must say it initially as things like ... and [laughter] and all of that stuff amazed me you know and and\nThen give it off because I'm going to confess here my mother ... all the time I thought there were a little I don't know bitter or Sunday it'll like they'd be really sweet and I thought that they didn't taste quite right I was never a big fan but you love them well I don't view about your does by the way\n[laughter] I I I Love them because you know there you go you when you open this package and you've got this kind of\nDelicious texture and ... you know we didn't have that you know or any desserts OKC when it was the festivities we made it and it was limited and so on so you know to just be able to throw it in your car and bring it home and I saw it gets added a school was wrapped\nIn Laurel [laughter] and then yes I got to wrap [laughter]\nYes and so so I was I was amazed by all of that and I was excited so food was different a peanut butter and jelly I feel like it today and sometimes you know at night the butter and jelly ... uh I like is\nMy guest a chef cookbook author and restaurant tour and then he ... she hosts the PBS series ... kitchen after a break we'll talk about turning the peasant food of
