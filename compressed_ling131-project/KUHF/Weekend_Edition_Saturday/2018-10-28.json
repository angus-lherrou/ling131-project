Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say\nYeah let me just say a few thoughts\nFirst of all my mom grew up in the Jewish community Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in squirrel hill\nAnd what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too horrific violent\nActs and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out\nAgainst what he's called pure evil\nBut he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual at his rallies with a little less ... he said last night at his rally in Illinois I'm going to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we're going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan\nThe George ... Berg also posted on social media the Jews were funding the caravan he particularly I was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nThe Kevin McCarthy the majority leader\nIn the house has been tweeting how Soros dire and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is\nPretty coded anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about whether the president's words words of other\nPeople helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened\nBut there is what he says and then there is what people here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns in the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer so\nTen days nine days out from the election we've got the situation\nTo process and try to figure out how to stop in the future\nMine let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the Senate ... ... just the community to the community I mean you mentioned that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away\nWe'll be offensive this past week affect the elections and if so how\nWell I don't know I think the easy answer the quick answer is to say that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nA house looks like it's trending to the Democrats to send it looks like it's trending to the Republicans but it might have some effect I mean this once again thrust gun violence into the political debate some people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings\nI Am Christy early hosted by from here are
