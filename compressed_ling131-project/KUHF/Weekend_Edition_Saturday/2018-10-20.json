G. God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote a column for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that data complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis and beer down ... was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments a after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed the obvious mister show jihad died a in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled\nThe president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWhile I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nA cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts acts as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies

call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he presented argument at his rallies he\nHas cast us in such a negative light that these three fellows who who beat Matthew Shepard to death they felt I'm okay how about that they felt justified about that and for Matthew\nTo come home to the Episcopal Church which he was a part\nAnd for the LDP T community far and wide to to see a church welcoming him to rest there in the cathedral forever is a huge statement and I'm proud to be associated with it you know who he will be resting near\nWell I Do know that in the crypt in addition to Woodrow Wilson\nAh is Helen Keller and her teacher and Sullivan and uh I think that is the perfect place for Matthew\nA great teacher and uh some
