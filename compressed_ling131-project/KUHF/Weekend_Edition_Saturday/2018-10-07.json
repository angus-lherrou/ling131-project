judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight played out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bills but while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage\nAnd all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they'd given me up it it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the the main thing was that I had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes I still feel to be honest\nOf trying to meet people the expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I look at me and see like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me um to go beyond that and to sort of complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt traditionally could be asking themselves many many are are you going to this realistically and have you really looked at your family your schools you're neighborhoods your religious organizations if there were a child of color coming in\nTea or environment about what they find when\nThey find mostly white people or would they be able to

pandas are getting pellets instead of plums in fact ... has been phased out completely that's because the fruit that humans have selectively bread over the years has become so full of sugar does use ... animals were becoming obese and losing teeth\nSo how did fruit gets so sugary and what does that mean for us humans we're putting those questions to food writer and author Frederick Kaufman who joins us now welcome to the program\nOh hi how are you great thanks so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agriculture human beings have been messing around with the ... plant what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which ... which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cross breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go to mediate leader the sex life of plants that apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main dates to remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states play a passes the plant patent act\nAnd from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter and to make the batter and also to make them see list to take their sex away in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually take the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds\nIt actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\n[laughter] when you read about how fruit um has impacted these animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I say for years now we've been lobbying\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelon dish it's full of just bright red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature the tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and tasteless\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are better as people don't realize that everything that we're seeing in the in the supermarket they're like super stars there like supermodels and and it leaves athletes like LeBron James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nTo let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the free world doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food and it's part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking and less good for us\nI think the argument among the dieticians is is that is the yes the higher sugar content is robbing\nA food of a a lot of bits of the nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we equal rights we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row of perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I Want that\nBut ... is still good for you then\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to eat is probably the best the best advice\nFrederick Kaufman is a food journalist and author thank you very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n...

left you stopped\nMrs Scheuer runs the conservative pack Mackey D's list speaking with us from Texas thank you so much thank you live\nAnd for a view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal pack democracy for America welcome to the program thanks for having me pulling this leak shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that Democrats had the momentum scenes they lost it\nYeah I'm not surprised that it's changed a bit of course it's tightening we're past Labor Day this is when people start paying attention to elections as the Republicans continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole they've dug for themselves\nWith the Kavanaugh appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been for the last six months this\nCertainly turned it up to an eleven or a hundred\nBut this is a pretty brutal last but the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the terms with a huge loss\nOf that's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court a and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the Democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win and we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault or whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that to both reasons are valid\nA he has a terrible right wing partisan record he was perjured himself he has a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they needed to type fight tooth and nail everyday to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women on this specifically white women and specifically suburban white women are leaning now more towards the Democrats but women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a but white women went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting a and engage democratic ... across the board ah we have an understanding that the future of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black and brown people of color or throughout this country\nAnd the progressive whites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that uh the white women are going to save us if you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future is\nWhat are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nYeah it's just the two biggest issues one is check on Trump's we definitely got to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump right now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate\nOr the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want\nA it's time that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's not just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism really succeeding better rookies put a Texas ...\nDigits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people power campaign on issues and a vision for America like Medicare for all\nCharles Chamberlain director of the liberal packed

associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court Trump was after to pick up\nNPR's Tamara Keith traveled with the president and joins us now good morning Tam good morning\nAt this rally was on the schedule before the final Kavanaugh vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women [noise]\nI think that's sort of [noise]\nFeel we're in many ways\nA lot of women voters\nThat to an echo of something that he said at a rally last week at in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked or for a her lapses in memory\nAnd Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points it cost the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that have had in the crowd with these values notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds pre Kevin I'm\nWell they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really
