about ... it's about\nA first of all a whole range of principles\nWhich you are squandering and completely putting aside it's\nAlso about the whole sociology\nOf people who are not even researchers and journalists people citizens who are looking for a breathing space in their countries okay these people don't even want to foreign political boxes they just want to exist judge they just want to go through their work and have an opinion\nIf the west doesn't take action on this all this will be in danger and\nAnd governors they haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but the Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees France is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were

breaking drought in the western United States and the seven states they get water from the Colorado River came up with a plan on how they deal with water shortages many hoped wet weather would return\nBut it hasn't the dry conditions have actually gotten worse and officials are working to avoid a crisis on the Colorado River from member station KU and see ... what point\nJennifer pit is looking out onto Lake Powell in northern Arizona more than an overlook full of tourists tearing down on the country's second largest reservoir and the concrete dam holding it up\nThere you can tell that there is a river here underneath this reservoir because it has somewhat of a linear it\nWorks on Colorado River policy for the national Audubon Society this past year was one of the driest on record and this spring the reservoir only received about a third of the amount of water it does in an average year\nDemands for the rivers water continue to outstrip the supply meaning boats Powell and its sister reservoir Lake Mead continue to drop it says without changes to how they're managed they could plummet to levels where no water can be released\nAnd if that happens that would be\nFor this region's economy for all of the people\nWho depend on the Colorado River and for\nAll the wildlife that depends on it as well\nMore is being taken out in comes into it like your bank account if you do that over a sustained period you will run a deficit that's James ... he's the Colorado representative on an interstate commission that oversees the river if you're talking about water\nFor forty million people and economies that are massive fifth largest economy in the world to the Colorado River basin represents\nA then that's significant acklin banking analogy is appropriate because the creation of a water account in Lake Powell is one piece of so called drought contingency plans in the works now\nThe plans basic premise is simple get states to voluntarily cut their water use now to avoid even more severe cut backs in the future Eric cute is the former manager of the Colorado River district\nThere's clearly a enough evidence that if we were to have another two thousand two thousand four kind of you know multi year drought the system is very serious trouble\nArizona has had the hardest time coming to an agreement figuring out the details of weather cities or farmers get their water allocations cut by how much and when but states in the rivers upper basin like Colorado have had issues to for example this thing called demand management\nIt's a difficult one it's somebody's gonna have to use less\n... productions aren't doled out fairly ... says there's a fear they could injure urban and rural economies throughout the southwest\nBut the thing we have to remember is that they can is over eighty percent agriculture holy\nPellegrino is with the Las Vegas metro areas water utility she says crank conservation programs like hurt agencies aggressive buyback of residential lawns won't be enough to avoid a crisis\nSo we can take out all the lines we want and still not solve the problems that climate change is going to throw at\nClimate change is one factor adding pressure to get these deals done quickly another the federal government the U.S department of interior wants the state water managers to finish the deals before the end of the year\nIf they don't there's a fear the federal government could come in and begin dictating how western states manage their water for NPR News I'm Luke Runyon\nMm\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nMeyer land and bell

W. M. in Milwaukee reports at Walker's taking his argument against raising the gas tax directly to voters at the pop\nWalker started running an ad this week this playing on screens at gas stations as people are filling up their vehicles\nWorried about a hate speech so most people I'm not racist but they also a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing a base stress themselves a little bit Romney they might somehow a come off as being hostile when but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group said look you know nowadays I\nI'm not quite sure do I say do do I say Jewish too as a black African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are going to show to me and and that's where this educational divide comes in\nBecause the kinds of people frankly who you know listen to NPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and so on they tend to be more comfortable knowing what ... and watch that invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have faith in the hospital but they're just unsure about what was to choose\n[noise] yeah I Want to take the term Latin next um which has gained popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that term the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these trends can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\nYeah and that's where we just have to be self critical about what's actually going to achieve more racial equality in our country if you think that for your own political reasons next is a better term to use then and Godspeed to you but I think if you talk to your fellow citizens\nAnd they care for example about the ways in which Hispanics are being discriminated against at the moment the United states but they don't use your for such tough\nI think you should see the potential allies rather than denouncing them or as enemies well\nHow does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what the survey says is the vast majority of the country I mean how does it practically work\nBut I think that's a huge difference between standing up for minorities that are under attack and talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of all of a different groups that you have to win over the in order to win election and I think that what's the difference between how black Obama talked about it\nAnd how has been talked about it actually\nI was struck for example by the way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why does but we have to have more equity in high school education she always she talks about the fact that it's unjust\nTo the children and poor school districts um who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global race of competitiveness with China\nWhen he talks about a prison reform he doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned usa talks about the huge costs to the taxpayer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument that is close to your hot but you also trying to show why does the business in everybody's interest [noise]\nI can hear liberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservative listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racist and and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are listening to a conversation about something like this in totally different ways\nNow it is a problem but some people on the old right for example use popular discontent with political correctness in order to get a license to spew things but as straightforwardly racist\nUm but I think the right to sponsor that used to have a little bit of a sense of humor and say yes look we can sometimes be true invested in whether the appropriate thing to say is a Latino or Latin acts\nBut you know what that is not a reason to deny but we have deep injustices in our country come join us in the political side or to make this a a country that lives up to its principles better off at the moment\nThat ... you can read his piece at the Atlantic website he's a lecture on government at Harvard and the author of the people versus democracy or freedom is in
