{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Have this contentious relationship with their mothers because it's it's so difficult to\nUnderstand one another and when I was growing up my mom and I were just always butting heads and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she grew up in ... in the middle of Mexico right and I was very very Americanized and and that's a common experience for a lot of brown women\nI find it interesting how many young Latinas now talk about the fact that they\nHad we'll issues around there let the nest or Mexican ness because the moms and dads were so kind of demanding and so they like pushed the actively pushed away their Latina Nestor Mexican it's\nWell it's hard to negotiate that there's so much I Love about my culture I Love the fact that we're so family oriented and\nLike a million other things but there's a lot I don't love you know I don't like the ... the patriarchy and\nAnd when I was growing up I pushed against those things and it created a lot of\nConflicts you know you use the term snarky to talk about your character who yeah\nIt's not what you think of when you think of Latino celebrating their ... and wearing pink dresses like she's an American girl who's got an American teenage\nAttitude yeah definitely and she's a lot of times very unpleasant and I think that's something that shocked people and I think that's interesting because\nHave you ever met a Fifteen year old girl I mean I was terrible yeah I was pretty terrible too yeah I mean you're angry at the world everything so confusing\nAnd you don't know what to do with that anger so you like take it on everybody around you\nAnd so in fact you know cool yet in your book your character she's rude she sarcastic off and she doesn't know when to stop talking what do you think it was important to create a character who is really difficult I think that we're not allowed to be flawed unfortunately\n[noise] and I'm really tired of that as a woman you know I I feel like\nI'm always expect to be pleasing and nice and sweet and polite and all of that and I'm not always that way you know and why are we allowed to be angry and to be fun to be a human being and it's just it's frustrating and let me know they're always portrayed a docile\nAnd fly it and yeah and who is not that way um she pushes against everybody she doesn't like anyone telling her what to do\n[noise] this\nBook when you were trying to get it published it was rejected by some agents because uh because what they didn't like the tone of the main characters\nRight they didn't like her voice and I said to myself well that's the part so I'm not trying you know and I took that as\nYou know we were telling me that they didn't like the fact that this was a complicated strong Latina character I remember one rejection\nReally was upsetting for me and I cried because it was really mean spirited and I just really upset I felt really discourage but again I felt like I didn't need to change the voice because I felt like that that's what made it special\nAnd so I just held out until I found someone who believed it and finally I did find an amazing agent who's been wonderful to me it all worked out so\nI think that's just a lesson for young women to just kind of stick to your guns and if you believe in something someone else was going to believe in it to\nA year has passed since the publication of their book and I'm a follower of years on Instagram and so I was watching as like you know suddenly Erica Sanchez the poet has a novel and it's like constant smiles and you're getting recognition and it's just like\nOh yeah definitely two thousand and Seventeen was just wonderful like so many amazing things happened I was on the New York times list et cetera and news just a magical\nTwo dogs any team came around and\nEverything seemed to fall apart on me I went through a really really tough depression started early in the year and it lasted about six months and you just do the most challenging time with my entire life and so how all these like wonderful things happen and all of a\nSudden I don't know everything just kind of\nImploded oh\nAnd then all of a sudden you actually put on your Instagram ... tell us what you said on your instrument\nI wanted to be open about my struggles because it appears as if everything is magical for me\nUm but that's not really the keys you know even though I Am incredibly successful and like very grateful for that I still struggle with mental illness like success doesn't cure depression and so I went through this really dark time and I just wanted people to know that\nThis happens and um that it's OK to ask for help and that it's okay if you're not okay and so yeah I Know a lot of\nReally beautiful responses to that I think people really appreciate vulnerability\nAnd I also talked about my recovery because I wanted people to know that it's possible to to overcome issues like this it's it's possible to I don't think ... beat depression necessarily but to to live with it and to address it so\nWhat are you trying to tell the young ... well anyone who reads the book but especially young let me nuts you know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino was dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life what do you say to them\nI Want them to know that I see them that I get it\nYou know I Want them to feel understood\nAnd and that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way and you know I had to someone else he's noodles and I adored her but like that was it I didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's\nA key to be depressed now it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that\nVery much [noise] I think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect both in society and was in her\nFamily is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise] I Know that they exist [noise] and ah [noise] it's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\n\nThank you for putting it into words Eric essential is we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate your interview\n[noise]\nErica ...
