tired of reading her teammates hair and decides to\nStart as voter registration campaign instead but now I'm here with Charlie Pierce for the week's news Hi Charlie Hi Karen on Wednesday three people were found guilty of wire fraud and the college basketball corruption trial\nI was surprised that prosecutors were able to convince a jury that universities were victimized by a plot to bring them better basketball players you\nYeah I was shocked by that to actually Karen I'm dying to see the appeals on because the the whole theory to cases absurd and has been absurd ever since we first heard about it but now these guys are facing serious time and some ambitious us attorney is going to get promoted and nothing about the sport itself will change\nNow that the trial is over the NC double a could decide on the basis of court testimony any information that prosecutors aren't even allowed to enter into evidence that the three victims schools should be subject to further NC double a sanctions does that seem likely to you\nAh yeah I think he'll take every advantage they can out of this because it just deflected all the attention away from the notion that the NC double a it was about to fall apart\nBasically do commonsense and that's what this trial has been about from day one\nCharlie as you may know I was once a WVU our intern and I rely on grade intern\nLittle did I Know that if I had just gone up the street I could've earned one million dollars\n[laughter] yeah this was the now you free marketplace if you happen to be a challenge at age Seventeen or Eighteen year old basketball player or various basically it was going to go to Syracuse he's searching prospect in the country if you believe ESPN's rankings\nHe committed from Syracuse which sort of makes it sound like a bell ship is going to be smart and he was going to play in a Julie and then he got a three month job with new balance [laughter] wound up\nMaking a million dollars is a quote unquote new balance intern\n... agent says his client will stand basketball shaped by looking for competitive pick up games and the only one who's notice that the new balance headquarters is located right next door to the Celtics new practice\nThat you are absolutely not the only person [laughter] I'm sure rich Paul ... also [laughter]\nThe LA Lakers and LeBron James lost their first three games of the season which isn't great but it's better than what's happening with ticket sales in Cleveland right\nOh God it's it it clearly will you knew this was coming [noise]\nYou know Cleveland is you know there's a franchise that outside of LeBron James has virtually no history whatsoever to tickets are going very very cheaply two dollars two dollars [laughter] well of course there are claiming that too so I mean I think you might have been able to goose the scalp or did you [laughter]\nIn August ESPN labeled the Maryland football culture as quote toxic\nThis week after a two month investigation an eight person commission says quote the Maryland football team did not have a toxic culture but it did have a culture where problems bastard because too many players feared speaking out\nAnd I'm really confused because when you use a word like fostered I'm really thinking toxic\nYeah I mean this is kind of odd actually there's a difference like if you drink poison now you've done something toxic but if you get a woman you don't like to take care of it within a subject in shelters I guess technically that's not toxic\nWell here are some of the things that the commission decided we're not toxic a coach who use homophobic slurs through food weights and only on one occasion a trash can filled with bomb it at players and let's not forget Nineteen year old defensive lineman Jordan McNair died of heat stroke and may where does this story go from here\nI don't know but I think somebody else wanted us to get program because if this is what was defined as not being toxic I didn't even want to know what actually would be\n[noise] and finally Charlie we would be remiss if we didn't at least mentioned the world series between the red Sox and the Dodgers and so I had chosen the most important topic for our discussion\nAs you know the nation will be lining up on November first for free tacos but not Red Sox utility ... cold please explain\n... stole base and that are insured free tacos at all Taco Bell locations\nAnd rock hall tweeted out that he won't be getting a free taco quote I'm going to stay away from the Taco Bell you end up on the toilet all night and this was not the brand that Taco Bell was seeking and gold finch apologize\nTo either again this is we we're collecting list now I'll sing Connie Mack didn't have to worry about ... fast food chains right at the top the list\n[laughter] you can find the sports writing of Charlie Pierce in Sports Illustrated and he joined us each week here on only a game things Charlie thank you Karen\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]",
