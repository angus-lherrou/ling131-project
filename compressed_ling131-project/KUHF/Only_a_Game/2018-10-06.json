dollars\nThe ambition is to make folks come the jewel in the crown for a whole new high tech region running from Milwaukee to Chicago with companies research for these colleges in training facilities a Great Lakes rival to Silicon Valley but look who's worry whether folks can go to good a deal\nJenny trick director of there were seen county economic development corporation was the key figure in attracting folks come but she says the subsidy deal is tied to specific targets including job creation\n[noise] well if they do what they say they're going to do which is to make that private investment and create the jobs the state accidental reflect the two point eight five billion that they had the potential to earn an annual basis\nAnd then there's also a sales tax exemption on some of that construction materials and thatch salad again if they do the acquisition as they proposed this additional earns in that respect for that\nNow it must be slightly controversial because as we were driving up and down the state we did see the old holding advertising saying Wisconsin doesn't pay into ... building basically the it's it's not just you're going to give them money so being relieve peoples or you you have offered them a very good deal\nChanges controversial right and then if you don't fully understand the details of the contract I'm as well as ads and political association with us begins to kinda create that right environment for um some dialogue\nBut the reality is you have to earn it to actually be able to get the rebate back it's not an upfront assistant years ago I mean it's an allergies and counties and states used to do that but really for the great recession and a lot of communities rapes that unfortunate consequences of that\nMunicipalities and and counties and states really took a different approach that with more of a company you take the risk and if you perform\nThen will step up and we're providing incentives and that's really how the state's contract without\nThe longest folks Cohen making this move to Wisconsin it might look like its hedging its bets in case new terrorists and an escalating trade will inhibit its ability to impose high tech goods from China into America\nThe Trump Administration would slowly love to claim it proves terrorists would forcing jobs in production back into the United states of America\nBut Louis whew who's the senior folks couldn't executive leading this project says the reasons run deeper than that and the decision to move to America was made long before President Trump was elected\nIn China is obviously you need to take advantage for the benefit of cheap labor but in us on the contrary there's no cheap labor but their talent to the benefit of panic right we would try to to go to the fact of the talents yeah we'll be up the automated system to both both take the cloud computing\nThe mobile devices to ... take out of his own intelligence all those things put into a ... right to begin to build things which will be very different from what we do in in China\nPresident Trump is boys saying we're importing philosophy much from China we need to bring stuff home was was not a factor and you'll consideration\nWell remember when we started working on this project that scene early Twenty one seven that's way before they any type of conflict between us and China\nRight I think we've before that I Would say women realize\nBecause of the market because of the up and and I waited ability of Palin's we should be here so since there is a more pro business policy what the new administration so we decided to come here\nSo I'll decision to be less to do with the conflicts but more to do what is available folding tons of talent and market\nOr chunks of you moving more production has so for instance you produce a complete sign here relevant in the movies it's going to be the license on\nWell I I don't like to use the word moving moving I see if there is a zero sum game I Would rather say that we're going to expand a lot of things that we might be thinking to do\nBut cannot be done in China and then we should do it here\nFor President Trump trade and trade rules are simple but the fact is neither is the case\nTariffs on steel and now the mini and push up close for domestic films retaliatory terrorists that access to expensively one foreign markets ruined plans slash profits and threaten investments will job's move abroad to areas not involved in the trade war\nNew investment in the U.S is based on America is huge\nAdvantages and high skilled workforce notes President Trump's tweets or even his terrorists\n\nAs simple drive through Wisconsin with its new businesses unrepentant consumerism would prove who lives in a few hours but it's a trend President Trump is not likely

[noise]\nThings changed I got hit\nIn the side of my head on I'll make it a low ball face\nFor the few weeks and months after that it just wasn't getting better was getting worse and it was a very tumultuous time for me I was thirty eight years old and I was considering retiring any way soon but not as abruptly as that obviously and part of the reason why I think that I didn't pursue\nA lot of opportunities back then is because in my mind I was capable\nFor years I assume the lack of brie on on my TV calling games and given commentary was because she was black I thought it wasn't enough that she made that incredible save her look wasn't the look that America was ready to celebrate\nIn reality it was a sport that gave her so much that was not responsible for taking so much away I just couldn't\nKeep my thoughts together I suffered\nYou know intense headaches every day I had you know vision issues I had I honestly felt like I couldn't learn anything new for a while because I couldn't\nMake it stick and then I couldn't recall it ... you know than the emotional stuff started to happen like anxiety and depression and you know panic attacks and things like that and so [noise]\nBasically everything that I had planned on you know doing just went into a whole\nYear after um twenty eleven I was actually doing ESPN broadcasting for that\nToo many eleven World Cup and struggled every single day we were in Germany for thirty days and every evening I Would go to my hotel room and cry and cry and cry every day because I couldn't make anything stick\nMy performance um

effects of her career ending concussion\nBut I was surprised when she told me that she wouldn't change a thing\nI met my current wife I Would never met Krista without it and um you know now and I think back on it it was actually something that change the path of my life in a in a good way I mean I'm as happy as I've [laughter]\nIn my life and this is going to last until I'm Ninety or whatever I Hope and uh it's it's a it's something that\nAt the time I I couldn't have seen mhm you know but it was just the path I was meant to walk\nThese days Brianna walk the sideline as an assistant coach for the Washington Spirit and the hallway the colleges and conferences talking with audiences of all ages about diversity perseverance and the dangers in symptoms related to concussions\nI'm forty six years old and it's been Twenty years since I first started playing in the national team and everything and now seeing the team that plays for the usa now all of those girls saw us ... do what we

mean I Love my medals I Love you know my accolades don't get me wrong but I tell you what would I have little kids come up to me who were you know my mom thinks you agreed [laughter] [noise]\nYou know what I think that's pretty cool I mean how many people can say that\nI'm a little embarrassed about the story I made up in my mind about what happened to brown a scary after the Nineteen Ninety nine world tap\nMy own experience as a young black athlete playing a team than in clubs that were majority white for coaches that seem to hate my being their lead me to filling the gaps of her story coupled with that embarrassment though is a sense of relief\nI'm relieved to know that I was wrong ... is an even bigger hero than I thought she should have been\nThat was reporter Olivia

three stories you should know this week we're going to start with football you know soccer the sport of kings and then move on to the NFL I'm joined by SB Nation Tyler times whose work is featured in the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing\nIn bookstores this week welcome back and congratulations Tyler thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalists you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honoring although the soccer superstar from Portugal who plays prevent us in Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward and a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten when all those settled with her out of court in Paris three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she filed a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her\nOr NATO has denied the allegations but in their reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all those lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger athlete on this planet you'll see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and Jessica of course the work you've done and Baylor and cabinet I mean you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level high to we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction but it made them it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nI'd if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or as always uplifted where the powerless or not this woman has every piece of it is possible\nYou have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that is one billion for one player and of course\nAnd just to be crystal clear it's not a massage any that keeps advertisers like rich Joan comfortable he's not a fan of that kind of thing this is kind of a weird question but\nIf suddenly fifty percent of sports talk listeners were women would that make it less attractive as an advertising place for you\nKnow the answer is probably yes but let me explain why would they now had twice as many listeners cause I Do now you could have fully expected the amounts to advertise at a certain level we reached frequent she would cost and so the only thing that changed at the top ...\n... talk to executives said ESPN Radio and he was surprised by their response\nThey seem very cognizant of the fact that this is kind of very\nAntiquated approach but it works you I think terrestrial radio they're basically ushering in an entire generation along\nIn a velvet cough and they have they have they know they're engaged they know they buy things and they seem okay with that\nBut there's good news if you're a woman who likes sports because in some ways terrestrial radio is being replaced by others things podcasts and YouTube channels and Instagram and Facebook and in those places women aren't just allowed their welcomes\nESPN is investing in pod cast with women behind them bike I can watch my friend Andrea Kramer and Hannah Storm calling Thursday night NFL games on Amazon Prime\nAnd this added play during last winters college football playoff\nThis last\nIt's a sad case of the basic gist of the commercial is that the protagonist Anna is an architect her boss ignores her ideas and leaves her to explain the stakes are high in into one day\n\n\nMake architects as anti Baker I'm sure this ad would inspire anyone who's ever had a bad boss but with that soundtrack nine to five is practically an anthem of second wave feminism that ad is targeting me\nAnd it makes sense because on the TV side of things as more and more people cut the cord sports are pretty much the only thing anyone still watch it live\nThis is why you see so many stations paying exorbitant fees just for rights to broadcast games you know that's the only way you're going to get\nThat many eyeballs and one lady so yeah they they have to be nicer because they're not just trying to sell a trip to a steak house or something like that they're trying to sell cards they're trying to sell home loans are trying to sell a bigger ticket item then more people than just from Hillsborough need\nAnd this is where the strategy of keeping the advertisers happy gets turned on its head I talked to Jennifer storms she's the chief marketing officer at NBC Sports group and she says her main focus to attract advertisers\nWe want to make sure that we are always serving our consumers\nBut when NBC Sports looked at their audience their consumers they discovered that women already made up forty six percent of NFL fans\nNASCAR again another forty to fifty percent of the NASCAR fans they are women so we're not just wearing pink hats you know we're really into it\nWomen were already enjoying NBC Sports products but\nWe took a look at it and then we said there's a real opportunity here to serve women even better and even more authentically and they're such large fans of her sports properties how do we give them more avenues more opportunities to express their fandom and engage with us\nLast winter during the Olympics NBC launched an initiative called on her turf it's a pod cast Instagram and YouTube campaign and\nIt's not designed to attract women\nSports it's designed to reach the women who already enjoy sports and inspire them to take on the world and in that spirit I had something to say that this guy\nI'm willing to share my sandbox as long as you

long week I've got things to say Charlie Pierce always has things to say and he's here with me now hey Charlie hey how're you doing\nI'm good but you know I got problems the American league division series is underway at Fenway Park as we know we've got Red Sox we've got Yankees but to me there's already been to lose the A's and their fans because baseball's perennially stupid\nOne game playoff you got a team that won Ninety seven games already home and I just don't like this I've been complaining about this for years I think that after a hundred and sixty two games you deserve a playoff series at least what do you think about this\nActually I mean I hate to say it but I Love I Love one even when he sent me too yeah even after one sixty two I Love on and on\nMean if I had a rooting interest in it then maybe I wouldn't like it very much but in terms of being a you know just a fan of the game I Love the pressure of one and I really do I mean I understand that baseball's different 'cause like the season and so forth but win or go home it's just the greatest thing in all sports so I'm a fan of them to be honest\nI've got two issues with that one this is not the NC double a tournament that's one of the things that bothers me the other thing that bothers me about this is we don't penalize them any other sport we don't penalize teams for not coming in first place in baseball if you don't win the division they make you play one game it's it it would be as if in basketball if you didn't win the Atlantic division you got to play a playing game\nFor the right to play the eight seed I just think it's weird and baseball I understand why they're doing it\nBut I just think it it really robs you especially if you're the age you had a great great season and now you're you're done after one afternoon in Yankee Stadium\nWell yeah but you know what I don't care I enjoy going on and on my sympathies to Oakland fans but I don't care [laughter]\nHow about two and done Charlie we get to post script in the Chicago Cubs you've got\nYou've you've you've got to tie breaker against the brewers which I'm sure you loved watching it regularly in the breweries when Matt then the cubs have to play the next day the one game playoff which I hate against the Rockies they lose ... Thirteen ... weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we're ... when a home game though you know I mean you know which of course we're gonna run exactly right you know we're team all year though yeah you know they went through the styles of what looked like the chimney yeah unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Only a Game", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
