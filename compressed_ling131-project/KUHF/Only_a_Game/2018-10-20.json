you tell it for me\nAs don'ts daily and Sheryl swoops rock their signature shoes on the WNBA stage a new generation of players was watching including future for time WNBA champions Simone Augustus\nI remember my first game that I went to my parents have the money\nTo drive us down to a Houston from Baton Rouge in we were you know at the Toyota Center and we were literally at the top of the rafters like we had our head against the to the polls at the top of the arena and I had to watch the game from the jumbotron but I did not care because I was in the building\nI was hoping and dream into one day be in their shoes [noise]\nYou know it just made me want to go home right then and just get to work\nJust like their idols Simone and her friends were sneaker heads\nBack in those days like day would come in and there had their their sneaker towel where they're like clean off the scarf mark said there was a toothbrush that really like make sure the the rubber soul was clean Simone was in middle school when Cheryl swoops in team usa took home gold at the Nineteen Ninety six Olympics\nBut by the time when she came out I was like too big to shopping them ladies foot locker and I couldn't get home\nI assume that they will make shoes for the the basketball player like you know we're obviously taller bigger\nThan the average woman I was ... super bummed out because it was like the first woman shooter come out and I was unable to get it and I'm a Hooper and I love Cheryl swoops to make matters worse to have some bones middle school team mates had the new shoes or was this kind of envious of everyone knows that had him every day coming to practice it was\nAnd knowing that see among like a hope the rubber falls off [laughter] two strings break\nSimone went on to lead the LSU women's basketball team to three straight final four appearances in two thousand six she was the number one overall picking the WNBA draft\nAfter ... I just assumed that so many other great women came\nTo the league will get their shoes and and that I Would be able to obviously get a pair but [noise] it didn't happen\nSimone began her professional career it's ... it's time for the WMBA in the years before her debut three teams folded another to relocate it she says the league felt the effect of the recession and the way to thousands and by then it had been years since the Nike ad released its last signature\nIssue for women no other brands before\nWe talked about it often like man what would a shoe look like what ... what would it feel like I'm you know who would get a shoe that's why we worked so hard we was like well maybe we are working hard enough we got to put you know good quality work on the floor to kind of convinced him that\nYou know we do deserve this today players like Simone or league MVP Brianna Stewart sometimes get customer models of men signature issues but even with the widespread sneaker culture in the late you know WMBA player has a signature issue to call her own [noise]\nLast year\nSimone found an opportunity for something different\nNow it's like I Want to make my shoes cool I just don't want us to be the basic Kyrie I wanted to have some some kind of some moaning and\nIn November Simone posted a video on Instagram of her shoe collection from high school and it got the attention of an independent shoe artist based nearby in Minneapolis he messaged her with an offer for a couple of hundred dollars he would take a pair of shoes and hand paint them using her design ideas\nI Love watching cartoons I'm a big kid at heart and so I started to play around with the cartoons and things like that\nAnd since the WMBA has no color or design restrictions for its players shoes Simone took Scrooge Mick doc penny proud and even the care bears on to the court with her so in a lot of ways this project is kind of your own way of making your own signature issue right\nYeah I'm hoping that it will open up people's minds to like you know what if we should give her a letter telling a design\nSomething in August just before the start of the WMBA playoffs Nike re released the air swoops to and even though Nike still doesn't make them in her size Simone was first in line\nI said forget it I'm buying a pair I got a size twelve [laughter] I'm hoping that I can squeeze one foot in there I think in enough and amazing to see an amazing woman like hoop who's accomplish auditions accomplish in the WMBA and in basketball period to be celebrated in that way\nSimone Augustus hopes that by supporting the air swoops in rocking custom kicks she and other WNBA players can inspire the next generation of women supers and maybe even a shoe company or two\nIs so disappointing to me to walk into the store and and I have no other choice but to buy a a male sneak it's time to change the narrative we put in the work we've or not or a moment to be able to prove to people that we can do

Carrying given and it's time for three stories you should know we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific study\nI'm not joking but I promise it'll be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both make severe thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like excessive drinking\nBut that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and no answers and ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain as younger that's when it's the most vulnerable\nAnd the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that the psycho social benefits seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought\nWell yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nYeah well I I I don't know if I have an issue with high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise it self esteem of the athletes to perform because you've got eleven guys saw it on the field as one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe empty\nIf you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you\nEven when you cross the finish line I Know that run across the country but [noise] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nBefore a year ago I had no idea what power lifting lots I never been to a weight room there historically not designed for me\nWaiting rooms were just weird place that I just didn't even recognize as a place that I could\nGo like I had absolutely zero clue what you were supposed to do in a weight room I think it's intimidating for anyone who doesn't know what they're doing but it's especially intimidating if you're a woman because you feel like\nWhy are you here taking up space where all these like big burly men could be using the space that you're an\nModern gyms are rooted in all male institutions from the Greek gymnasium to bodybuilding gems of the twentieth century\n\nSo how did you ... three that how did you first start lifting weights\nSo I first started lifting weights because I was doing a program have bikini body in the name like it's very like not great but part of that program as they introduce the idea of using these very late ... and I realize like I enjoy doing those I thought they were kind of fun\nBasically someone had been like well if you lift weights like three times a week you can get the same\nBody for like half the amount of time I was like that sounds great of course when I Try to do that\nThe first time I put up our bond that back I almost fell over I felt stupid I felt weak and I felt very female I finished the rest of my SATs that I went home embarrassed\nIt was at a gym near my house and they only have one school Iraq\nSo you walk up there he puts up are in your back and you go to school why it's so weird and and so requires so much balance or wobbling all over the place and you just feel very stupid and like someone is waiting to use a squad rock and I can clearly see you have no idea what you're\nDoing I'm pretty short at that time I was very skinny and I definitely was freaked out for a while for the first couple of months while I was doing it and I was like I don't approve them all wrong I'm going to get really strong [laughter]\nPower lifting as a brute sport it does not carry you look like and it's simple have you done more than the last time what turned my timid shuffled to the ... into a series of session of selling female power lifter on line there were no other fits the woman I seem\nFitness inspiration so it's it's so it's definitely income says it's more like a lifestyle brand\nOr it's like look at how like skinny and beautiful I
