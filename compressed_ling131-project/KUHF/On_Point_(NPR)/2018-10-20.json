families\nIn the best of times and the worst of times ...\nYes if I was writing a sentence and you may not want to play this game but we'll try I'll I'll play in a game and the sentence I write is he walked into the room and saw Laura sitting there she looked sad mhm what would you do with a sentence like that where does how does it come alive well\nI Want to write than that no one has ever written before so that might be might starting point but\nHow did he know she was sad she looked sad but then like I said look at a really sad person\nIn in real life if you don't mind voyeurism or else in your memory and I think in some time when\nYou were with someone who is that okay what was it that hold you was it something\nIn her eyes was it the folk of her shoulders maybe it was that she was trying to look some other way than the sad thing about what it was it was unique that caused you to remember that and then put that in the sentence\nIs that what you do on every one of your sentences that how you look at them\nWell that's one of the things I Do to everything and then you know of course signed a metaphor find similarly find some way that a person can be said that no one has ever written before that you know the sad as a bluebird who's lost her eggs\nOr whatever that\nKind of silly but you know I mean I find the way to say that nobody's had before then go back and read the sentence allowed and see how it lands and read every line of dialogue\nOut loud and see how it's found that the hotel in your own ear does it sound like something people would really say\nDoes this thin and have the rhythm you want to have a litter ration or internal rhyme every single one of those things have to be examined in every single sentence\nIt's not like tuning in engine it's it's like building an engine you know from paper clips and diamond it's just you know you have to make this thing and it takes a whole lot of work there no short cuts\nIn writing and rewriting and rewriting luckily it's work that I Love to do because as I mentioned I write to hide out in\nMy house I also love my family by the way that it the end of the day I Do stop\nTalking to these people in my head and I go out you know go downstairs I make dinner that I enjoy you know my friends and family but I really I'm lucky I Love what I Do\nThat's Barbara Kingsolver all through the new novel on
