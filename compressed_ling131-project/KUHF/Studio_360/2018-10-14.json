government\nWell the good news on that front is that despite the desperate really efforts of the Trump Administration to stop the trial it is going to start\nOctober twenty nine and it is going to take several weeks of testimony the plane is in the Giuliani case our children's trust case have come up with a a stellar group of experts scientists economists technology experts\nSo they have a very strong powerful case to present we haven't seen\nWhat the Trump Administration is going to present by way of the case because they've been desperately trying to run away\nFrom this trial and not show up but I don't think there's any way for them to escape so we're going to see some pretty dramatic testimony in a court of law solidify the need for immediate action and it's coming at exactly the right time with the elections coming up the twenty twenty elections right around the corner\nI think we're going to see for the first time a really robust\nCross examination tested evidence of of what exactly we need to do and how we can do it the important thing of course is not how bad is the situation but are there are solutions can we actually accomplish the things that we need to do and the answer to that is yes we can\nIf we get busy right away and work as hard as we can we can't do it uh say many many experts so the trial I think it's got to be a show piece of what we can do and must do\nLet's say that um the youth climate lawsuit against the federal government prevails at the trial level what chances there that a ruling from the lower court saying that the government has to act would be upheld by the president Supreme Court we have\nWell I suppose conventional wisdom would say the odds are against that I think you could probably look at maybe winning in the Ninth Circuit but it's hard to see five votes for some of the theories that the youth plaintiffs are advancing that there's a constitutional right\nTo a sustainable climate the current state of the law is not what we need and not where we need to be and it may well be\nThat this unprecedented threat of climate change will itself change the law\nIt's certainly a brown versus board of education moment in our constitutional history\nMaybe the Supreme Court even his curves serve it as as it is would be up to that I I suppose you could say it's doubtful that it is but on the other hand nothing ventured nothing game that I think I met the point and a lot of frankly law professors and lawyers are at the point\nOf saying we don't have any other options you know we've got to push this argument as far as we can possibly Porsche and hope for the best\nPeppermint a professor of from a law school and this fall a Fulbright fellow thanks so much for taking the time with us today ... thanks Dave enjoyed

agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial but this new report
