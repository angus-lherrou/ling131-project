attacks\nBut as I did turn up in defiance of the Taliban and ISIS who struck campaign rallies in the lead up to these elections militants also tried to obtain voting Scott a deadly attacks around the country\nThere was also confusion about how to use the new biometric systems and some days didn't have ballots because of the kind of surrounding the elections voting will now be extended to Sunday in some areas they had Dade NPR News Islamabad\nSo this is a real problem for him that's one of the reasons that he's fighting back so hard with his campaign ad\nNo these protesters are the trolls\nThat had been hired by the opposition are these folks in neighborhoods are really upset\nNo people are really bad and you can see there's all kinds of evidence that a lot of people don't like flying in their backyard now do Republicans end up coming out and and voting for Scott anyway just because he's a Republican or because they liked what he says about taxes or because they don't like Chuck Schumer\nThat's certainly possible but every election and every statewide election in Florida is close Governor Scott won both of his races by one point\nSo this is something where if the slime you know if it splits a few voters or if they persuade the few voters to to leave the Rick Scott space blank that could really tell the difference between losing in winning\nSo how have environmental issues featured in past elections in Florida\nYou know Florida is you know in the last Twenty years Republicans have won the governor's race has dominated the legislature it's obviously a swing state but it's definitely filtered read but it is always tilted green\nThe story I like to tell that Jeb Bush in Nineteen Ninety four when people were talking about him that he was sort of the Arab parents who his dad who is most likely going to be president some day\nThat was Nineteen Ninety four I huge Republican year and jet ran as a right wing conservative he was actually making fun of environmental is on the campaign trail and he turned out to be one of the only Republicans to lose that you hear\nAnd his brother became the kind of error parents four years later one of the first things he did after he lost the election was he joined the Audubon Society you ran in ... in Nineteen Ninety eight as a green Republican anyone in his ... in a landslide\nSo this is something where it's not always the deciding issue but it's an issue where you don't want to be on the wrong side of and so far in Florida that really has been lacking and that's become a really big issue in the governor's race where you see a Democrat Andrew Gillum who is talking about making it a top priority\nAnd in the Senate race where democratic incumbent Bill Nelson who is not anybody's idea of a particularly inspiring or effective leader mobilizing action on climate change but has been at least on the side of doing something and Rick Scott has ended and he's trying to make that an issue\nBy the way what about climate change as governor Rick Scott is famous for totally agencies not to use that phrase and yet you guys have been horribly slashed by hurricane Michael I'm a game you know down south and Florida pretty tough time last year how does climate figure into this\nYou know I Lived until a couple of years ago in South beach and we'd have sunny days where Biscayne Bay was rising through our storm drains at high tide climate change is with the possible exception of Alaska\nIt's is tangible in Florida as it is anywhere else you know we've got most of our state as long as we're very close to the coast where a\nPeninsula jutting into the Gulf Stream we're\nRight in hurricane alley these are all incredibly powerful motivators for Floridians to at least pay attention to climate change and that is an issue where Rick Scott has been on the other side\nI'm Michael looking ahead what hope to use the the Florida will remain livable and economically viable place and he's coming decades given\nAll these issues [laughter] I'll look you know I'm a\nI'm a sort of short term pessimist and a long term optimist I voted with my feet right I ah I moved here I'm raising two kids here\nIt's not a you know we're just going to have to figure out how to live more sustainably and we're going to have to take better care of the waterways didn't make this such an awesome play which is going to have to stop dumping are crap in it and what people like me I've always said is that you know eventually Mother Nature is going to screen loud enough that we're gonna have to\nListen and certainly right now we're hearing that screen then we'll see if the politicians listen\nMichael ... book is called the swamp the Everglades Florida and the politics of paradise is a senior reporter was Politico Michael thanks so much for taking the time with us today Thanks for having me for the record Governor Scott did declare a state of emergency for red tide and said quote\nAs southwest Florida and the Tampa Bay area continues to feel the devastating impacts of red tide we will continue taking aggressive approach by using all available resources to help our local communities\n[noise]\nLet's take a look beyond the headlines now with Peter died he was an editor with environmental health news on the agenda and Oregon\nDaily climate thought or on the line from Atlanta Georgia in the middle of this political season Peter hey what's going on\nSteve knew we heard earlier in the show from Michael Grunwald about the race in Florida the algae blooms on both coasts and everything but let's consider and appreciate that it's a real breakthrough in Florida in the Senate race because\nI Can't think of any time went environment has been as front and center and the tight political race as it is now between governor Rick Scott challenging Bill Nelson for his Senate seat\nI have to agree with you I'm trying to think of when I was at the top of the ballot and them I'm not sure we've seen it this way on a major risk\nKnowledge because there's a lot going on with the environment in Florida\nHe taught to me about where else in the country we're seeing the environment I think it's mostly about issues right\nThat's right there's a big initiative in Washington state dealing with climate change that also hopes to put a carbon tax within the state it's opposed by a lot of fossil fuel introduced a western states petroleum association is the biggest one\nAlaska and Montana they're clean water initiatives on the ballot and clean energy initiatives in the states of Arizona and Nevada\nAnd Arizona Nevada also have some pretty close Senate races what else do you have for us today\nWell Imran Khan was a provincial politician in Pakistan\nHis province had seen huge environmental degradation from deforestation from timber theft and as a provincial official he proposed the planting of one billion trees in his province\nWell that's a big deal how well did it work\nDidn't get anywhere near a billion but they still managed to plant\nA few hundred thousand trees and it made a difference and now Imran Khan is no longer provincial official he's the prime minister of Pakistan this\nMost populous country in the world with two hundred and twelve million people and growing fast\nAs it grows the land use issues the deforestation issues become more critical and he's now proposed planting ten billion trees\nHey what are you from the history of all it's for us this way\nLet's go back to Nineteen twenty nine another instance of draining the swamp from the White House do Warren G Harding administration short lived because Harding died in office but they managed to put together a boat ... reputation for corruption\nAlbert Fall was the interior secretary and long after Harding died in the administration faded away in Nineteen twenty nine and October Albert Fall was convicted of bribery and an oil scandal that became known as teapot dome\n... and I gather he uh he
