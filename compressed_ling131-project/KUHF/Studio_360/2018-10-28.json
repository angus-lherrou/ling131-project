videographer happened upon three well just offshore his pictures prompted a worldwide frenzy two of the wells eventually escape\nThe Soviet Union send an icebreaker all the way over to help the whales the third one disappeared and is presumed dead\nOr how is that funny Peter\nOr maybe it's not funny but it's ironic because there are an estimated two hundred gray wells believed to die like this every year but the presence of the mighty video camera made these three literally into Hollywood Stars there was a movie called big miracle made about all of this starting Drew Barrymore\nUh about ten years ago\nBecause there was a whale of a story well how about we mark the cliche for extinction fair enough Peter Peter doctors with environmental health news that the agent Oregon daily climate

spokesperson for the Israeli ... what's going on ... face a real catastrophe the situation there is unbearable\nBut it's also frustrating at least from my point of view because ah it's a bit difficult to help someone that doesn't want to help himself\nProblem in death has really that the ... most people do nothing in order to try to solve the problem now the big Asian of Israel\nIn this agreement that we have to provide a certain amount of water to Gaza Israel is providing more than twice the amount that we are obliged by the disagreement that amount is just a fraction of the clean water Gazans need every day\nAnd so the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate humanitarian groups estimate that Gaza will become uninhabitable by twenty twenty barely a year from now\nTo avoid that international relief agencies and the Palestinian water authority or working on a network of big sewage in desalination plants so\nThis is the feud with us from a certain extent\nThis is ... more and
