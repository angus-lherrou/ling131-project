up on the verge that we're probably released to last week a week prior I'm Still kind of hanging around those things\nWhere they feel safe well it's it's what they know out here on the prairie and also will continue to feed in and around these parents for a little while\nWell after the release more gradually wean them off of the the food as they\nLearn to find you know actually too in front one in fact so thin out of their buddies in their front [laughter] when when you didn't have the right thing hours outside\nOf this refuge other many prairie chickens at waters per chickens that live in in the wild\nSays it well there's only two places that they occur now and it's\nUnfortunate but you can't find them anywhere but this refuge and then also there's a release location data goalie accounting on some private ranch land you know hopefully they do well at both places but the reason we have the split release program is because of\nThings like hurricanes you know and if you're a hurricane hits the coast in one place then hopefully you know it only affects one population and nothing to our population\nThan usual thing about Hurricane Harvey that's a lot of people know is it affected the whole Gulf Coast and so if you're ... chicken that was that was bad news because it affected the entire a historic range of Persia and ineffective both the release locations and what happened out here to get flooding we got tremendous\nFlooding of course is like a lot of places to\nWhat a lot of people forget or is that the year prior to Harvey and twenty six team\nWe had what's known as the tax day flour and believe it or not that was actually more severe for us the harvest let him on some of the ten thousand acres we had approximately one third completely submerged a summit over three thousand acres that were under water and we had\nOf course the rest of the refuge that was affected by standing water and that hit us during the breeding season so it was very very had a big impact on us and\nThat started a decline over the last two years of the population\nAnd so you know Hurricane Harvey was the double whammy you know it came in and uh took that forty birds down to only twelve birds in the spring of twenty Eighteen\nThat's wild birds out on the prairie or thank goodness we have the captive breeding program still in place and there they had a record year or the captive breeding facilities did for producing I Want to project and so\nIt was a good year for them to have a record year because we need as many of those birds to try to rebuild his population as possible\nSo what do you say to people when they uh you know there are endangered species that are for lack of better words sexier cooler a book about a a big cat or something like that or an eagle or whatever people say oh look at sort of save a chicken or what are you what do you tell them\nI guess that's a common question and it's a fair question I mean we're human beings and there are things that impressed us and there are things that do I get that what I Would say about the prairie chicken is that it's not necessarily the prairie chicken itself\nThat we're so desperate to protect its what they represent a set native prairie ecosystem that has become so rare and we're saving what and a lot of people's mind is a very iconic species\nThat represents a larger landscape Marjorie assist you know I don't like to see any species go extinct I see that as a failure by us human beings that we can't\nPreserve our environment and I think it should concern people when we're seeing species\nGo extinct or the question then is what are we doing to our environment and how is that environment going to support us someday if we're losing all of these native species\nTo join us thanks

can I get on the [noise] this is a lot of Irish\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis is not your typical physical therapy approach that gradual it's not about avoiding or even into that pain the clinic treatment part of this last about a month savannah one of the teams I talk to you went to one in Kansas City that's modeled off of David there are about eight like it around the country\nI I was begging not to

the sidelines\nAs they do and I think the Russians and wait on hand her foot that bothers them almost there appears to be a real stream from one [noise] rheumatologist David Sherrie how these kids experience pain is different\nTheir nerve signals got caught in the glue that was then amplified after an initial stimulus I might have been as trivial as a minor sprain from dancing or playing a sport he likens what happens to win a microphone gets place next to a speaker ...\nWould that's it goes to the microphone but then it comes out the speaker goes to the microphone comes out just because of their microbes and it becomes so painful you have to leave the auditorium you can turn\nTo the same thing with these kids you can you know just a just a light touch on just\nBarely touching your skin or you know your hair is brushing on your back that can't possibly hurt yes it can just like a very soft sound in the microphone is too close to the speaker can make you lead the auditorium [noise]\nFor some people this amplification results from physical science blood vessels constrict turning a hand or blue either way\nThis is where the sensitization comes in like when you put your hand in the sink full of hot\nWater or jumping really cold pool at first that might seem unbearable but the ideas you get used to it\nJust pain usually means damage into what we have to retrain these kids to things that the pain is not damaging their body and so they need to work through their fear to retrain dinners\nThe exact cause and trigger up this pain isn't clear to rare condition and the research is ongoing David and others suspect genetics play a big role in combination with the environment\nAnd psychological stressors it's often misdiagnosed but the pediatric pain specialist Dr Elliott crane this condition represent an important window into pain itself\nIt captures so much of what pain is it captures the actual physiology of pain encompasses the modulation of pain either the amplification or be minimization of pain you're captures the psychological response to pain all the\n... and fear and depression that chronic pain causes\n... director of pain management at Stanford's children's hospital in California where he treats this condition too he says no question intense physical therapy and decentralization as a critical part of the process but he worries that hardcore boot camp approach can be too much for some kids\nIf a child that can be a very traumatic experience very very traumatic\nElliott is concerned that can induce more trauma even the TST\nIt's not necessarily for somebody to feel the pain to get better\nIt's not true there are no pain no gain\nTwo lines just drew lines to retrieve data cherry at the Philadelphia clinic disagreements\nI think there to tell them old you know we don't worry you know you know poor baby you know we'll just do this we'll coddled you bring your long graduate if a disservice to them\nHidden it's this approach isn't for everyone depending on someone thinks IT levels and other factors for that reason the beefed up their safety and psychological\nProtocols and supports throughout but they've just patient have to be pushed to get better so they learn to stop letting the pain controlled am here's savannah again completed a similar program in Kansas City before\nI honestly thought painless just part of life it was part of who I was even if I hated that it just seemed like it never was possible for it to truly go away for me and now it's gone\nSavannah Seventeen now she no longer needs the wheelchair she still has to maintain a therapy routine both physical and mental but she's taking college classes now she's volunteering she's excelling and living a full life\nAnd it's totally weird and totally crazy but in like this amazing mind blowing right I feel is a way\nFor married Kelly the other teen I talked to who went through that same program her pain it's just as pervasive as it was before if not more but she says still the clinic experience changed everything\nYeah the pain is the worst it's ever been but it doesn't define me or control what I Do it's really good to feel that way to like have something that controlled you for so long and then to finally\nBe free of that is really an incredible feeling she says now she speaks out everyday teen activities she dances she's in Cedar she's active and engaged and unlike before she doesn't hold back [noise]\n\nA lot of good reported this story [noise]\n\n\nWe're talking about facing our fears and sometimes the stuff\nWe're scared off turns up and our dreams and our nightmare as the most vivid dreams happened during a specific stage of sleep rent and sleep your\nHeart rate is elevated your blood pressure rises and and you have all this new activity going on in your brain\nThat's neuro scientists bill on July ... he says that during REM sleep you're lying in bed your heart is beating and all of these neurons firing the part of your brain that\nProcesses emotion Olympics systems slice it up so much that it looks the same as when you're awake some scientists think that\nThe reason we dream is to make sense of all those random emotional fireworks other parts of our brain turn totally off during REM sleep like the part that controls logic that's probably why dream so often don't make a lot of sense\nAnd then the preset and at that point you have to go down and rubble and I said you mean get down on the floor and bravo and he said yes\nIt was this really creepy church and it was dark and there's like flushes our side I remember like realizing that are being possessed I was going to do something terrific\nBy the way there is no real difference between the dream ending nightmare a nightmare is basically just a dream that stresses you out to do the crazy dreams that we have during REM sleep have a purpose here is neuro scientists Alondra all again so one\nTheory for why we dream or even have nightmares is that it had a survival mechanism so if you and your dreams see yourself I don't know like wrestling with a beer or something that is going to make you more likely you when you encountered that in real life uh be able to deal with the situation like that\nI don't dream about bears but I Do dream about being late for work or not being able to finish a project on time and it's always stressful but there's another kind of nightmare that sound a lot worse than that you're completely paralyzed\nAnd you're half awake a feeling like I'm about to wake up but then I realized that I\nCan't move I knew the bath tub was overflowing and most of the time it's like someone like standing over your values than a murder you I often feel\nThat there are people with me in the room\nAnd I also knew that there was a stranger wandering around the house\nThe best way I can sum it up as like a feeling of suffocating\nI couldn't I moved to hide or defend myself as a stranger and I couldn't get up to turn off the bath water\nReally is like my consciousness stuff underwater\nSometimes they can with myself up screaming [noise]\nThis inability to move the feeling of a presence in the room or pressure on your chest\nIt's called sleep paralysis it's a glitch that happens during the ... face when you're having intense weird dreams and during that face all of us are paralyzed to stop us from acting out our dreams maybe jumping out of a window if you're dreaming that you can slide\nA part of the brain in the brain stem totally paralyzed you during REM sleep\nWe were scared watching one of those movies or just listening to max green talk and that's scary voice\nOur body goes on high alert our heart rate speech up and so does our breathing and it's not just what you were feeling although people can pick up on those signals to\nBig eyes and raise browse and this little ... is our bodies will get tense or they'll often sort of shrink down a little bit we even smell different are frightened\nThat psychologist Abigail marsh her book is the fear factor and she's been researching an interesting correlation between the ability to detect fear and others and two polar opposite personality types what she's found is that people who are very altruistic or benevolent\nAre really good at detecting other people's fear cycle pass on the other hand are terrible at reading this emotion\nThat's right so I and other researchers as well have studied people who were psychopathic and have found that uh they're really bad at detecting when other people are afraid to if you show them what to most people would look like a really vivid fearful facial expression they have a lot of trouble detecting what it is\nIn fact one of my colleagues in England tells a great story of psychopathic\nA felon that she was interviewing and she had showed him a whole series of facial expressions and he'd missed every single fearful expression\nAnd he got the last one and he knew he was doing badly and um [noise] I said when he saw it you know I don't know about that expression is called but I Know that's what people look like right before you stop them so I he knew he'd seen expression before and he could even come up with where he'd seen it but he he couldn't link it to an emotion\nBut why does that lack of of recognition lead to psychopathic behavior\nWhile the idea is that if you can't recognize what somebody else's ... that's an index for the fact that you can't really understand that emotion and other people\nUm and part of the problem with people who are psychopathic us that they don't experience very strongly themselves a and so they're literally having trouble empathizing with that emotion and other people and so because of that they don't really understand why it's even bad to make people feel frightened\nWe use the term psychopath sort of loosely is in our society but how is it defined for your work what is a psychopath\n[noise] that's a great question yeah they were the words of how this come to mean a lot of different things people who study psychopathology usually to boil it down to the sort of central thing that makes people who were psychopathic different is their insensitivity to other peoples distress are suffering but that goes along with an a number of other things that\nAre are common and people who were psychopathic including um being manipulative or having some trouble with impulse control and engaging in lots of different kinds of antisocial behaviors including aggression that's not the result of\nYour frustration or if that rage but that's sort of cool the I'm deliberately planned out to hurt other people\nAnd and the other side of that coin because you have found that people who are very altruistic are better at recognizing fear does that mean when we see fear and another person there is a mechanism that makes us care and help that person perhaps\nYeah it seems like what happens when we see somebody else Who's Afraid as it kicks off this amazing little chain reaction inside our brain that ultimately leads us to care for the way that that person is feeling\nAnd that chain reaction depends fundamentally on process as with any less so somehow the and the bill and it was us to\nProbably simulate what that person is feeling create a little ... sort of internal shadow of what\nThe feeling of fear feels like and then in addition probably with the help of this a little um hormone pocket his and that is active in in the lab it also stimulates in us that desire to want to help the person who's feeling frightened as well and depending on the person how strong\nMotive to care as really varies a lot between people\nWhat does all of this mean your findings in terms of what we need to know about fear how we relate to others what are the big takeaway point\nOne of the things I Hope people realized about fear is what are useful emotion it is not just from a self preservation standpoint but because our own ability to feel the emotion which I think some people wish they didn't ... you know it seems like it'd be a nice thing to go through life fearless\nAnd yet our ability to feel the same motion allows us to connect with that same emotion and other people and leads us to care about other people who are in trouble and so I think hopefully people will come away with a new appreciation for this sort of amazing emotion\nThat psychologist Abigail marsh her book is the fear factor [noise]\n\nHaving you know just said fear is an amazing emotion and I think part of that is because it's so new launched it warns us but it can also challenge us in different ways\nFacing your fears can be liberating or even thrilling that's why people love roller coasters right take a listen to this awhile back we send reporter Joe Hernandez to try a ride at\nSix Flags in New Jersey it's called ... that dropped off do first\nWe look at it is maybe just struck tunes I was like ready to get all pick the slow ride to

good going on in her life and other times like this one she's just spending because things have been really hard lately\nSuspension definitely helps start that movement that you know more of a
