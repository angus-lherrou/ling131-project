N. A. it acts like an amphetamine seat basically and was banned by the food and Drug Administration and a few years ago\nThe FDA has tried cracking down but there are dozens of workout supplements that contains DNA and other stimulants\nExcuse countless it's counts yeah I I Can't keep track of them\nThat's Peter Cohen he's a doctor at the Cambridge health alliance and he also teaches at Harvard Medical school\nBut mostly he's known for being a supplement detective for ten years he's been testing supplements especially workouts to find out what's in them he's on doesn't that contain stimulants and he says there are plenty more out there\nThe ... told me that there's over a thousand different software on their list at president\nTheir list of performance enhancing substances that athletes aren't allowed to take either because they offer an unfair advantage or because they're dangerous some have never even been tested on humans\nSo it might be something has a serious artifact but we would have absolutely no idea\nOf course there are lots and lots of people who take pre workout without any problems but they've also been reports of some pretty scary stuff heart attacks strokes liver failure plus\nChest pain panic attack\nHeart racing shortness of breath\nWe've started seeing some of the fall out of the past few years class action lawsuits from consumers\nCleaning injuries from taking these pre workouts they've also been several well publicized deaths linked to pre workout that Peter says it's just a small part of a larger problem with a supplement industry he says one CDC estimates suggests\nAbout twenty three thousand people end up in the emergency room every year due to ...\nSee might be asking why the FDA isn't doing something about these workout supplements that are putting people in the hospital Josh are seen as a public health professor at Johns Hopkins and a former deputy commissioner of the FDA and he says\nThe state does not know what's on the mark\nThanks to a law passed in Nineteen Ninety four the FDA isn't allowed to regulate supplements the same way it regulates drugs even when regulators figure out something bad going on with a supplement the burdens on the government to prove that that's the case using lab tests which Josh says are expensive and time consuming plus\nThere's research but even after ingredients are banned that they're still found archers the exotic video that was banned\nBut there does seem to be a growing consciousness of the dangers case in point are fitness coaching model Kevin about a year and a half ago he quit using pre workout and he posted a video on YouTube explaining why\nFor morning over more from taking a pre workers are starting to take care of them is forcing the morning show I saw a lot of that anymore\nIt's put on the whole ... workout is still hugely popular and Peter ... supplement detective says Internet sales are just making the problem worse but Peter says there is one way to fix the situation changing a lot to give the FDA more power\nAt some point I think that we're going to decide that we don't want to take pills and powders that are advertised as if they improve our health when they actually have no evidence that they work and might be putting our health risk\nSo I think eventually consumers Americans are and decides that this law is not working for us and we're going to see real change\nBut let's say you still want to take ... work out what do you do the FDA has is simple recommendation talk to your doctor first\nFor the pulse unless\nWe're talking about ingredients why they matter and why we should pay attention to label\nThousands of people end up in the hospital every year because of medication they're taking maybe there does seem to have a splitting headaches pulses racing the problem is lots of times patients are unsure what medications they're taking\nThey'll say well doc I take to green pills one blue pill and then I Do take a purple pill I think\nThat's what we are ... he's an emergency room physician in New York City and we check in with him every once in awhile to hear what's happening in his world refused all the time\nYou know people are always having reactions to medications you know we don't always have access to their charts if they've been to different hospitals or their primary doctor isn't on the same health record system is us we have no way of accessing information\nThat's because health records don't talk to each other\nIt's like you have different competing companies and different competing hospitals and they are not required to share data so it's almost like if you have Gmail and I have like Yahoo email like we can only send emails to other people at the same emails us and we can't send emails to each other you know um\nIt's it's so dumb I don't know but that's just the way the system is set up\nIs a viewer suspect a patient is having a reaction to a medication he has to try to piece everything together\nOkay so at the end of the day many patients that we see tend to be on similar medicines like a lot of patients are on beta blockers for their heart or a lot of people are on blood thinners so after a while a practicing you start to see the same side effects\nOver and over again so you may see an older patient coming in who's complaining of dizziness and usually you can figure out\nAnd and you'll do tests also to see like oh their heart rate is going a little bit slower\nIt should be going there probably taking a beta blockers maybe their dose is too high and maybe that's what's causing them to\nFeel dizzy it's rare that of ear can just type of patient name into his computer and all that information pops up instead he often finds himself calling up other health care providers looking for clues\nYou know if you come in at three in the morning we may not be able to get in touch with anybody\nUm sometimes I'm been on hold trying to get in touch with a different ER for like an hour which is not practical you know on the corollary you know I Would get calls all the time like can any available resident picked please pick up this phone\nAnd all of us kind of just grown 'cause we ... we know it's going to be some outpatient doctor in the middle of nowhere I mean like can you find this patient you know what happened to them now you're like you're digging to your own charts trying to figure out what happened to this patient meanwhile you have your own patients to deal with so\nIt's so crazy to think about especially to think that we live in you know it's twenty Eighteen and we know how technology works and there's no reason that things should be this way\nHe says the best thing we can do as patients is keep a list of all the medications were taking

something to do now to no longer eat or you avoid\nI was in the grocery store here in Massachusetts and I was looking at it was like a bottle of lemon juice because I can be a really lazy cook because I\nWork all the time right and I thought maybe and I'm reading the ingredients on this bottle of lemon juice and the less ingredient or sodium ... which is a ... a really commonly used preservative\nThat Wylie really went to the mat to try to get taken out of the food supply and there's not a ton of evidence that it's anything particularly lethal but I stood in the produce department grocery store\nAnd I said you know I'm going to buy fresh lemons right why do I have why should I add more of this into my diet butter and I'd just go in and actually take a few minutes and squeeze lemon and get the real thing that was a big shift for me and I found myself\nPost this book much more of a label reader and I am a science writer toxicology writer I don't fully understand

nutritionist sodium too much of it can contribute to high blood pressure stroke or heart disease\nThese are all major health problems in Philadelphia and in recent years silly city officials set their sights on reducing sodium they're focusing these efforts on Chinese takeout restaurants which are often located in predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood\nIt makes sense a lot of Chinese takeout food is high in sodium and African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and other groups but there is some pushback against this approach we send Nina Feldman to get some dinner\n[noise] so I'm In west Philly and I'm going to check out ... Chinese and American food is the scientist with the phone number\nBut actually I always wanted to try to say I used to live around the corner\nOn my way here I've had two other Chinese takeout five fifty blocks away and there's another one around the corner\nThis is not unusual for certain neighborhoods in the state there are more than four hundred Chinese takeout places in Philadelphia that's more than the number of Burger King or Wendy's McDonald's pizza huts and KFC's combine\nWhen I walked into Troy long I met this guy George Walker who works nearby and no such good and then they had\nLike a like a full\nJournals too [noise]\n[noise] right [noise]\nSaw at Georgia's recommendation I went with the general\nWhich has about half of my recommended sodium for that\nPlus I got some dumplings\nThe plentiful Chinese food options in the neighborhood were exactly what caught the eye of Philadelphia's former\nMayor a few years ago that was the start of the idea for the healthy Chinese takeout initiative\nAnd they noticed usually yellow signs all down the street and ... and ... like what are those signs for that's nutritionist Jennifer ... from the city public health department and they looked closer I realize they were takeout restaurants he's like wow there's so many take out these Chinese takeout restaurants around [noise]\nUm we should do something with the\nBeginning and twenty twelve the city worked with restaurant owners to help them use less soy sauce and fewer other seasonings high in sodium they focused on their three most popular dishes Chicken Little Maine shrimping broccoli and general ... chicken restaurant owners were trained by a professional chef on ways to alter their recipes and make sure that food state teeth\nEven just a little bit of a sodium reduction I think it's like six hundred to nine hundred milligrams you could still see\nA rigid or reduction in your blood pressure points\nThere was no financial incentive and the program is completely voluntary still about two hundred or half of all Chinese takeout place it signed up researchers at Temple University Center for Asian health studied the effort a year and a half after the owners first change the recipes they were still making the dishes with an average of about twenty five percent less sodium\nThis study didn't measure actual health benefits for the customers so there's no we didn't know it sodium intake actually went down diners could've just ordered different dishes added salt or eaten at different restaurants the city did conduct taste tests as part of it steady and Jennifer says customers couldn't tell the difference between dishes before and after [noise]\nAnd rent a takeout place in North predominantly African American at\nHer place can walk is working with the city\nLimits our customers did notice when her cooks again using soy sauce and that made her nervous so first\nFirst of all we walk away about it we will be lost in the summer\nBut when she started talking to people about why they got on board\nSo when we came on and on the other thing\nDesigned just for Chinese takeout places make owners steel targeted\nWhen I also work with pizza parlor third cheese steak place when asked lane she switched Mandarin to play a little currents you know I just I was young I was hung on says she doesn't feel singled out some customers value healthy food so if the city can help her make her dishes healthier freight is young\nIt's approached checks out from a public health perspective go to where the problem is but some worry\nThat an effort like this there's a striking resemblance to another time in our history when Chinese restaurants were targeted for using certain ingredients your students science historian Sarah Tracy\nAnytime you do that you start with an ethnic group first in the name of the health initiative your your um helping to shore up the boundaries of racial or ethnic different\nSerious reading a book about the history of MSG or mano sodium glutamate that's a chemical compound used in lots of Chinese food and plenty of other foods to like to read those Campbell Soup been KFC it adds that savory mommy quality that keeps you going back for more\nIn the late Nineteen sixties MSG came under fire in the medical world Sarah says this happened after a Chinese American doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of medicine which side\nI than having these symptoms when I go to certain Chinese American restaurants I get numbness I get tingling flushing and my neck and I'm Wondering fellow condition is this something that you have encountered in your practice or your patience telling you that they're experiencing this\nSarah says that from their sort of panic cropped up about MSG and Chinese food and the symptoms the doctor described became known as Chinese restaurant syndrome\nChef for quick to both that they cooked without it because they didn't want to lose customers leader in the nineties the FDA commissioned a study to look at MSG adverse health effects it turned out there weren't many for a very small subset of people MSG can cause a bad reaction but for most it's safe\nSarah doesn't think the hysteria was really about food\nWas also about fears around a migrant population and what kind of America are we living and who who with American out an immigrant and for what kind of America we want to create in the future\nThe MSG scare was around the same time there was an influx of Chinese and other Asian immigrants to the United states Sarah says intolerance for these new groups stokes fear around MSG now even after the FDA has shown that MSG isn't harmful Sarah says the damage has already been\nDone Chinese food and Chinese culture\nOften still linked with an additive perceived to be tough [noise]\nAs I'm waiting for my food I'm thinking about all of this the Phillies takeout initiative in mind\nWhat are the potential risks of framing a public health effort around a specific group and why do it that way if you could do a different way\nAnd there's another layer here the people eating the food in this case the Chinese takeout initiative is focused on improving the health of black and Latino Philadelphians African Americans do have higher rates\nHave hypertension than whites in the city but there are a million other things that could be contributing to that\nMuch easier to lecture people of all what they're supposed to eat better to change conditions are structural inequality\nSarah is talking about the other factors in people's lives that can cause high blood pressure up your risk for heart attacks or strokes for one chronic stress is linked to those health risks living in poverty which a quarter of Philadelphians do is a huge stressor violence is another big one\nMore and more public health experts are looking beyond people's individual choices and pointing to a community level of forces that affect health\nThey're asking other questions to like the low income black and Latino residents have the political power to lobby for healthy affordable food in their neighborhood is the answer is no that might help explain
