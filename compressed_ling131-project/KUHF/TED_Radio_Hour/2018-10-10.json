was here at this point in time\nWe know more about the larger life here\nLike the grizzly bears or even the nearby caribou herds which local first nations are working hard to protect\nBut they're in and the other scientists are creating a baseline of the plant insect and spider presidents here and that groundwork less other scientists come along and ask more questions like Howard humid climate or industry affecting\nThis place for\nMaybe a scientist will want to do some research about one of these tiny spiders so that baseline needs to be in place in order to do all of that others

think they're behaving as well they're trying to shoot something away\nAnd there aren't very many things you want to do that to\nBlack underground like oh I see them there on that they're in the little light area voter Roth out crop\nWe see a mother grizzly bear and her two yearly there meandering through the valley during Radio's one of the scientists Bob Bennett who's down at camp Roberts there and can you go see them\n[noise]\n\nYeah we're on the rich weird and yelling and we came over to the\nThe bears are kind of song turning away from camp except one of the cubs stubborn and heading toward camp during suggests we yell at the same time to help scare them away for good\n\n\nThe bears run out of the valley\nClaudia in there and decide they're collecting is over this part of British Columbia has a lot of grizzly bears we shouldn't be surprised to see them but it's still shakes us off with it be easier route down to a camp is where the bears ran off so we opt for a steeper slope instead\nThe next morning we briefly forget about the bears over breakfast\n... which is going to be done to a good job\nThat day we hiked up to a place with a view of a different Sally the mountain were on is lush and green started with the limestone enlarge patches of snow and ice it's mostly alpine meadow covered in mosses likens and tiny plant some flowers set of carved out a nice here for its cold and higher up\nI ask Claudio why northern and high elevation places like this one or the most sensitive to a changing climate\nThe species that occur at these elevations they're adapted for these cold temperatures and if they live at the top of the cold mountain now there's nowhere left for them to go when the climate or on the arms up\nThese other meadows may look a lot different at the climate changes the ... floor\nSweet that lives at this elevation as any loss to treat the trees are going to fill the valleys and come all the way up the slopes\nIf that happens there are many things that live up here that may be out of a home\nSome of the impacts are inevitable and people instead of talking about\nAdapting to climate change but that's we're it probably won't be able to happen at the level of the species that are most vulnerable and so they're really will be potentially loss of species and we don't know which ones and we don't know how many\nIs just a a guessing game\nIt's the third day of the expedition and him navigating some challenging terrain this flow is sick with ...\nAnd other plants sometimes up to my waist or taller as I hike around with ... he shows the science of tree line for that is one of the signs of climate change for the body I mentioned earlier in trees start to grow at higher and higher altitude\nIf you look up the slope here\nYou don't see any dead tree\nWith that said just to me is the trees and not been there very long\nAnd by long I mean within you know maybe they've only been there for a few decades so they haven't been there long enough to live and then die whereas we looked down here\nTo see a few more dead trees\nAs I follow can he stops together more samples the scientists have together as much as they can in just state [noise]\nGet will take months before they have them all identified and had a lot\nThey even send some of the more difficult spider samples to a lab for genetic work so far are you feeling positive about what\nThey found we do all think that we got things that we can get um the last couple of days so we have had some new things yeah so that says\nToday is the last full day in this area before a helicopter is supposed to fly to scientists to a new location [noise]\nBut dark clouds start to move in along with thunder lightning and rain we often get rained on by ...\nRain is coming down harder so\nIt's mid afternoon by the time where\nAnd it's ...\nAnd we stand our chance the rest of the day waiting out the weather\nWe've been here since Tuesday and tomorrow is friday or pick up day [noise]\nFriday morning comes and it filled windy\nAnd there's a cloud nestled in our valley\nAre helicopter can't land in these conditions\nSo a group of us squeezes into the cook catch drinking coffee and things it'll clear it's way too risky to hike up the slopes together sample but it doesn't stop friday or even thinking about all the work that needs to be done\nWith no so little about what's around us so at this point you know we might be discovering still discovering new species but we don't know anything about the life history where what they need habitat requirements what they eat they just don't know that stuff so there's lots of questions still out there\nThe cloud doesn't last the ranch in ... and the wins gets even stronger\nAs we wait in our

stalled for the moment [noise]\nBut the work is far from over [noise]\nMolly Segal reporting from British Columbia\n\n...\nYou're listening to the polls and we're talking about all the things people do in the name of science some researchers have to get out of the office and travel too far flung places to do their work others want to do that to get a fresh perspective for example economist\nJason whiskey Jay teaches and researches at Boston University and this past summer he went on an adventure\nFive bicycled across the United states and I just completed three thousand miles of pedaling I started at Union Station in Seattle, Washington and bicycle to Union Station in Washington DC\nThat's where we caught up with him at the end of his long trip in part this journey was a personal fitness challenge\nI went from not bicycling at all\nFrom six months ago to being able to eighty miles a day and go across the country but\nFinally here rise at the end of the road\nIs starting\nPretty says job now is to set up his sudden dial and at the exact right moment measure it shadow on his part Arab back and re China does the same\nFor the full faith and other laws are free to for\nAnd lo and behold our photos are three point nine centimeters different with me that the earth is us here\nWhen it comes to flatter areas it was definitely a different approach from say Neil DeGrasse Tyson instead of trying to score rhetorical points Curtis was doing what flatter say they want he was reaching out with an experiment anyone can do to test whether or not there is round\nBut just like with Tyson their response was split he got praise from people who are already on his side and comments like this from people who weren't\nWhere you started off with NASA spreading these large or are you just an idiot\nA few fighters even made their own videos trying to debunk Curtis says experiment including one that invited Curtis to the upcoming flat earth conference in Canada what\nMr science guy here a bike rider I Would love to have you come out but I Would look you to show your findings\nIs that voice sounds familiar that's because it came from the same guy we heard from earlier ... Davidson and he says even though his videos sounded kind of aggressive his invitation was sincere\nWe want to be jealous we want to find out what we were not just holding to the ... and and being left out ridiculed by the world because we love waking up every day outing not feeling we ate it but we really want to know the truth\nAnd the end Curtis did not go to the conference for the same reason a lot of flat or if there is no longer engage with people on the other side aggression ridicule Curtis says some of the comments he got worried even kind of scary\nGoing but we're kind of threatening towards me saying I Wish he got hit by one of those vehicles or I Hope you drink bleach on die basically\nWent away mission failed the video doesn't seem to have changed any minds or hearts but Curtis says he did learn a few things from the whole experience\nI'm One of the key ones is that we do need to approach this on an emotional level if you just start voting facts that people are brings we'll just get close off or especially if it's something that they feel emotionally invested a\nCurtis is still figuring out what that might look like but maybe it could start with that same sense of all and amazement that first got Curtis interested in science\nEverything and more more wonder is a more interesting I remember from billion questions you can suddenly I it's just it's like fascinating puzzle that also makes me feel I mean the ... political it makes me feel one with the universe because we are we're all connected\nFor the pulse endless town [noise]\n\nWe're talking about all the things people do in the name of science and mentioned if you can only study the subject of choice at specific moments of time that rarely happens and you have to travel all over the world to catch the host and one more thing conditions have to be perfect\nThat's your life when you uh studying aspect of the sun that are only visible during a solar eclipse astrophysicist to read a whole broke made a film about scientists chasing eclipse is it's called black sons and astrophysics adventure her own interest in this is more personal\nI think that your body can't believe what it seems and so you have sort of a physiological response to it I think it's a Ken too if you've been living in the city\nAnd you go to the country and you see a full dark sky for the first time and you're like oh my gosh all these stars they've always been hidden and there's a sense of wonder and off\nTo read it teaches in South Africa at the University of the western Cape and she has traveled to see the spectacle in Ghana in Australia and Japan\nEverything goes twilight because the sun was blocked out so the temperature cools down and it gets quiet and um it gets a little bit dark and the birds and animals tend to rest during the ... they think it's night time\nSo it's it's quite a quite an experience to worse worse the long trip yes but I argue that you don't want to go to a short clip you want one that's over two minutes long because I think you don't get that feeling\nIf it's short eclipse so I went to the twenty seven teen eclipse I went to Idaho for it which was about a minute and\nA little short of minute and a half and I was like this is just not long enough you know I was nice it was pretty it was interesting but I didn't get that sense of euphoria in an office and yeah\nSo I always go for the ... the kind that last for two minutes during one of her eclipse watching experiences to read 'em at two other astrophysics is Alfonso sterling and took him all the shape Hakim\nHe's so big and boisterous and loud and then I'll find just so quiet and exact and\nI was like it was just hysterical watching them work to her and I thought at the time while this would make a really nice film to follow these too because they work their both African American men they're very different backgrounds but their colleagues and they both study the corona of the sun\nThat's the out of the most part of the sun's atmosphere so ... went with her intuition she started to make this film she's the executive producer and also the host and she follows ... as they set out to capture two different solar eclipses\nSo they each have a different aspect of the corona that they're interested in so Alfonso studies the lower atmosphere of the sun right so polar plumes and prominent says\nHe also studies the visible surface of the sun and the photo sphere during a solar eclipse the moon slides over the sun's surface\nYou can lay the blinding brightness and that allows him to see right down to the edge of the social sphere\nAnd then Hakim he studies the corona the solar corona\nAnd he wanted to get some measurements of how many electrons were in the entire corona but again he needed to see the entire corona which you can only see during a total solar eclipse so that's why they were they chase eclipse because they have these two things that they need to get\nBut you can only get it with a total solar eclipse\nThey have to be in the right place at the right time their equipment has to work and then there's always the weather factor here's a clip from the film that ... talking\nAnd your moment to shine last about one minute\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from watching the film what's your hope for the ...\nFirst of all the straw to me is interesting it's fun\nThere's not that many African Americans in it maybe about a hundred and twenty over all the history that stays there is a hundred and twenty African American astrophysicist so one of the scenes\nHas I think five African American astrophysicist on a balcony looking at the sun\nYou've never seen this before this is like history making so we do exist and we do really interesting science and we'd like to have more African Americans come into astrophysics and into the physical sciences\nTo read a whole book is an astrophysicist her movie about solar eclipse is it called black southern\nEverything\n[noise]
