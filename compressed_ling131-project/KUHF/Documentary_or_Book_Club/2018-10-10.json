World Service a ...\nAnd this is taking up a bit on the earlier question about whether a Sheila remains consistent whether she ...\nOur environment as we should be because it's so out of touch with nature so I think this says that I think that no I didn't have a six cents\nAnd some are also with the the family cook Mrs lover who went\nTo the ... I'll tell you I've been out of [laughter]\nOn the opinion that five said she's with too many that are not doing another one [laughter] I kind of kind of see what you mean [laughter]\nAnd Cape May have a listener on the phone now in Melbourne in Australia she's Carline borrowed Caroline welcome I gather your uh pretty much fine of ...\n[laughter] very much so I Love life ... life and I've been in the I think we're recommending it to read it in mind Melvin ... cup a lot yeah and they loved it too I think the case one thing that that I take it for me but then life ... and ... and ... when\nWas the same of animals that Fox's dog bad Silva hat and the black ... that are paid a carrot to toys people name and fake ... nation I light trough Kate why animals or say Kathleen wave and in the story\nMm good question and I think a lot of it unconsciously as because I write I've noticed looking back I Do that a lot signals this whole flux of birds and some novels and of course as it was dogs\nI'm always very aware of animal life around me is that some folks are men bass up to ... other\nThings [noise] uh but um it just seems a natural thing to do and maybe it's again that's me trying to keep in touch with nature in some way but I think it's they provide us with very beautiful images so I think that's one thing but it's quite straightforward to my thinking CG puts their fertility and you\nKnow flying saying\nIt was quite good ceases actually to animals and came back because I mean any UC oh for those who talks\nCarline ... planning to watch a dissertation on on a moving take ... to ...

Howard marches and perhaps how you would ...\nThat's a good question I I think I can take tripping solicit something I didn't fit as I wanted to recreate it for my own\nUnderstanding and I've pleasures around what I can see that but I'm simply deep in my relationship to that thing which I had just miss and I think ... I became aware of is on there was so well with lots of life had to go to New Orleans is about the booming ... different kinds of her\nBut in the afterlife the ... center of the book is the plates\nAnd I did realize that there's an awful lot of things we don't know there's an awful lot of sense that we're not\nUh publicize because they would have been bad from around our view is that what was colored through the propaganda that existed at the time and a lot of it is is you know that varied gung ho kind of things that the ministry of information and pushing it and I think\nThe actual feeding into ten percent of the people at the time was much darker than that and much less ... in a way because\nThe became about survival rather than ... than the subways and I think it was just discovering statistics which were horrible that bombing you know building debts and and the different various for me\nThat I think [noise] see I understand I'm not sure that I did in a way I think I just felt\nIt more because I really like creating an atmosphere in books I read like creating the ambulance and I feel that I I really was able to enter into that and that was my wave experiencing the war I suppose but yes I Do I still feel I just missed it because I was born [noise]\nFive six years afterwards and said that there when I was growing up I was very conscious and oh my uncles it's soft and that my father was a coal miner and that they will have very different experiences which I didn't have access to set up the way it maybe it was just a selfish thing on my part ...\nJoined guy said I'm going to take a risk kids well you are you [laughter] are you old enough to for men but it's just very small child well the the bombing of London was like in the ...\nThe small child to turn which I Do have specific members over ... career in my mind um\nDid did you feel talking some captured it the way you remember it\nWell certainly the booming I'm American remembers shooting lumber ... moved from um for my bedroom remember from\nThe other thing before I was very conscious off particularly I was only grew up thinking about two of our bitterness and older child I moved here in our job\nWas to run the most part mhm you bring my account and some of your accounts of the bombing mhm um ... well the place was in one\nOne ... ... well just remember the ... was ... Tsering Tommy run them\nBecause they didn't get the great myths of there with the bombing were bedside says that they were targeting accurately which of course they had no idea what ... the U.S we didn't when we bombed it said it was entirely just happened to be you know most most folks fellows talented unfortunately on people but [noise]\nFor talking of the bombing those another question from Isabella Maya in El Salvador and Central America who wrote I was completely taken aback by the description of the blitz when she was trying to survive this ordeal to the point I felt was that\nSo I was wondering about the research and the amount of time this must have taken to make the reading so visit\nI research is something you forget once you've done since it was really sad how long did you set for how much research you and I'm like oh I don't know I Can't remember who said she said different these days when I wrote behind the scenes that museum it was amazing ate before the Internet\nAnd you would do what you do is done you'd go to the library or you go to a reference library and you'd take notes and you would order books and it\nWas time consuming and then the Internet came and it says everyone was very dubious about the accuracy of information on the Internet and then I think we've gotten a competent [noise]\nBut you do now is you such as you go along as if you have a question you know if he's up so it's much more seamless process whereas you know before you could say oh I spent three months and in the library was searching on this but now you know 'cause it's hot and sweaty raunchy although\nThat's not entirely true life afterlife or go to in ruins is I\nDid a ... year of trying to in most myself so I wrote to read a little too of biographies and ... I watched a little to film footage [noise]\nI did as much as I could because\nYou don't want to become over burden with such because then you become tedious basically I mean there are moments when I get carried away by setting you know go to in ruins because I'm not a technical person I had to\nTry and get to grips of capitalism technical things to do with bombing and uh and it's something that you find that you start talking about in your fiction you have to put yourself back and take no no no this is an awful decision to a handbook for the mud and engine [laughter]\nAnd then you have to forget there was such that you did and you have to write the fiction nuts when you start going back can and and checking them putting things in and doing more so it's it it's not easy quantifiable to me these days research because sometimes it just simple sitting in your garden reading a book that\nSomehow I feel like it was it\nHad gotten since like you very much ... I'm Kathleen O'Connor from Northern Ireland originally my favorite chapter in the book is the one written from the German perspective and I would like to read more around this particular topic\nAnd my question is what was your favorite written source in your search from the German for say this is this is at\nOne point for him one of her life is a ... is in Germany ... living in Germany she um she's still a British woman but she's she's a um we do see actually about ... to ... somewhat from from that side of the jungle\nYes I I did become obsessed with Eva brown or ...\nI I had to be held back from being excited whenever I chemical Seventy back either as I started going [laughter] you know Mr there's a luxury was too young to remember is said as a there's a lot of color film footage for example and just film footage but not a color film pushes so I'd I'd say that um although that sounds", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Documentary or Book Club", "city": "Houston", "day": "10"}
