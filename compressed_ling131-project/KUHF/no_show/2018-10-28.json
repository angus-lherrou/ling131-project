to go into the bushes and those will seize nearby like that's interesting because because it basically after all this he more or less sets up the situation that that kills his client yeah it's like why is it okay in\nThe second scenario and not in the first scenario what's buried bodies right yeah well interestingly Lisa learning the or the ... the law professor that we spoke with for this episode she says that when she teaches this case to her law classes um you know like even if you\nPresume that this was privileged information which Mr ... says it wasn't 'cause Garrett talked about on the stand belief has said even if it were privileged information and only Armani knew\nHe could still reveal it in this case ethically really why\nBecause you go back and look at roll one point six which is the current ethics code it says a lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client\nTo the extent the lawyer reasonably believe is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nSo you could quibble about this you know is this just this meet that standard but once Carol is on the lose\nYou know knowing what Frank knows about his having committed multiple previous murders my reaction is that it was very reasonable\nBut in our case had the highway if he had not had a hit list and when she looked like he was going to murder more people if he had not threaten their lives if instead he was going to sneak out and some we'd go to Rio on a plane and if he could get to it then\nOur lawyers would not have been able to tell them outside we place because no one was going to die\nYou know if I had been representing this man and he was on the loose than if I knew that he had killed several people and that he is\nA sociopath or something like that I Would uh I Would estimate the odds of his injuring or killing other people as very high\nBecause serial killers that's what they do\nYou know if it were another case and he was just going to run off someplace and there was no danger to anyone\nUh then maybe it would be different\nWhat is the argument would be against that when these things are going to think of it the argument against others\nEven if someone tells you a secret as his attorney or her attorney you're supposed to keep the secret when there is a\nConclusion of the case in person as either innocent or guilty how long was to keep the secret like forever\nSet the forever forever why\nUh well the the the idea is that um if you watch clients to be able to speak freely to their lawyers\nUm the the lawyer is simply the clients agents the lawyer has that information at the behest of the client it's not the lawyers decision to reveal it\n[noise]\nTo our producers Brenna feral and not guilty and

he's said some things about the press as well and tomorrow he's expected to be elected president of Brazil so as a journalist who's been critical of both scenario where does that leave you\nKnow I don't think anyone really knows I mean he's often depicted wrongly and the western media as being Brazil's Trump and he's actually much closer to say Filipino\nPresident to tear day or even the Egyptian dictator general should stay in terms of what he believes in what he's probably keep bowl of carrying out so I think everybody in Brazil who is part of results political and civic life journalists politicians are ... who have criticized him in the past are all thinking about what it means for them personally\nBut but you're a journalist who's who's written about him I had there been ramifications all ready for you to do for writing critically about a year but Wilson there over the past four years\nWell about four or five months ago he went on to Twitter and used an epithet or or LDP\nCheese and translated into English which is the equivalent essential Leo calling someone a faggot for inciting his followers against me and just last week or a billionaire evangelical far right pastor who supports them and owns the second largest media outlet and media conglomerate in Brazil\nTried to investigate journalist that the intercept Brazil our families and published an article and threatened to broadcast a story that dug into our past I'm sober sure there's already been so many precautions and there was going to be a lot more once you actually get some hands on the levers of power\nAnd and I said let's talk about this this anti gay stuff because most of the nurses the Brazilians don't like homosexuals but they don't persecute them they don't hunt them but then as you say he used the slur to describe you in public so you're a gay man who's lived many years in Brazil how do you think about some narrow presidency will affect you\nAll very central prong of his rhetoric for many years in fact the thing that got him attention was not so much\nMassaging or the racism but the homophobia um he most notoriously said only two years ago and asked what he would do if he learned his son was gay he said I Would never let a gay son I prefer to hear my son died in a car accident then brought home a boyfriend and\nThere's already been a kind of wave of violence again algae cheese mostly against poor people and the ... on the periphery in the interior of the country but there are certainly\nUm inevitably an inflaming of that kind of climate and the country that has seen a big evangelical religious lay 'em that's very anti gay and just a country that's still a socially conservative not withstanding how Rio de Janeiro is perceived internationally for tourism purposes ...\nThat you might have to leave [noise]\nI mean it's not something we're actively planning my husband is an elected official here in Brazil last year adopted to Brazilian children who I regard as being the property owners of the future of this country right I'm Sorry not acting our bags and not have been we would do you know easily or readily but I think like most people we know we're\nCertainly in about contingency plans\nWill begin because the language that that both narrow uses the language of the purge and he said about a ... he's talking about his left wing political opponents here he says either they go overseas or they go to jail that's that's that's something that he said this week so do you think that he can make good on that or do you think he'll try to make good on that\nI think he will definitely try to make good on that I think the big question there there's really only one faction in Brazil that has the power to stop him the only one that continues can happen any\nCredibility your faith on the part of the population and that's the military which I'm the one hand is behind his candidacy in a rather consolidated unified way\nBut on the other hand has been steeped over the last thirty three years in cocaine and with the idea that their principal patriotic duty is to defend the Brazilian constitution Brazilian democracy so whether they would\nSeek to impose limits on how far and you can go and he's kind of incursions or whether they wouldn't be active in eager participants in it as something I don't think anyone knows and that's for sure the big mystery of the big question mark Neumann overall so we'll both\nSo narrow is betting that that that people are almost style jak for the military dictatorships in the sixties and seventies it seems that\nSeems to have worked for him politically do you think Brazil's democracy is more ... than than most of us believe that was\nDefinitely and I think you know one of the things that people in the west take\nFor granted because they are democracies are old and therefore their institutions strong but it is in the U. S. where\nI Would I Would say the American democracy is more vibrant than ever as a reaction to Donald Trump or there's these established institutions designed to an end are very effective batch\n... imposing limits on what the authoritarians whereas Brazil's democracy is only thirty three years old and it's institutions not just because of its youth because of all the crises of corruption and economic suffering or very fragile\nAnd there are very few institutions capable of functioning properly let alone and posing meaningful limits\nAnd someone who has this much popular support behind\nWhen you look at the problems that that Brazil's faced recently the corruption in the seemingly hopeless poverty that so many people are mired in should we be surprised that a populist with this kind of a a extreme platform could could could gain a foothold\nAbsolutely not um it's it makes perfect sense than if you're ever going to have and making about friends in the u._k. and Trump than the U.S and the rise of extremist parties in Western Europe which is that\nYou know if you want you can just call the people who are voting for these movements all kinds of names race is access to eight balls you know for whatever you want in some cases that might be true\nBut the reality is that when a ruling class fundamentally fails\nTo safeguard the interest of a huge portion of the population sooner or later they're going to realize that and they're going to be supportive of whoever is perceived to be on the outside of that system that they hate and threatened to burn it down and\nI think if until we come to grips with that and start engaging in some self critique we're going to have a lot more Brexit Trump's in Boston ours in our future\nIt's widely believed that both ... tomorrow Glenn do you expect the day to be peaceful or do you think there'll be turbulence\nI think the only way they would be turbulence is that there were a very unexpected result mainly the workers' party winning\nSome slight shift toward the workers' party over the last week is not possible but Boston are has already said an advance that he would regard any\nResult other than as a byproduct of bread and butter or if you take action against it so I Would only have stuck unrest in turbulence in the unlikely event ...\nGlenn Greenwald thank you very much for being with us think about me appreciate it Glenn Greenwald is a cofounder of the intercept and a longtime resident of Brazil\nWe have to take a short break we're coming up even Robinson is back with a new volume in her trickster trilogy and it's an app and get ready for trickster drift\n... from the radio this week I chat with Alice Waters fans are shaping nice in her new memoir coming to my senses waters revealed unexpected pass from counterculture activists to fire Montessori teacher also and this week showed realm guy author of black girl making\nComing up this week I'm no street radio from peer Sunday afternoon at two o'clock on Houston Public media news eighty eight so\nWith less than two weeks in the mid term President Trump is doing all he can to fire up the Republican base and I should really\nBud with early voting already under way which side is more fired up by the president scare us next time on the politics show for them\nSo they easy as sick as you keep up with media lose eighty eight seven\nThis is your NPR station Houston Public media ... chips used in in the way she Stevie eight point six used and surface of the University of used\nOn bread ... you're listening to the six from CBC Radio one on serious XM and public radio international pure live stream of on the radio play or Canada and CBC Radio apps and we're on line at CBC dot CA slash day six\nWhen taking nightly strolls people can hear screams grows and voices\nI don't think I've talked to that part [laughter] neither would I that's fairly ...
