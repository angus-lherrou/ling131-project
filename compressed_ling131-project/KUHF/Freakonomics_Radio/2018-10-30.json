I Am the director general of the uh World Trade organization\nUh since to any sort of teen\nAnd would you describe the director general rule of the WTO as essentially a diplomatic wrote\nThe diplomatic rule of the uh a director general is the one that he has to perform as a\nAs a building roads bridges he has to approximate positions you have one hundred and sixty four members now a to guide and um and they have very different\nPerspectives of uh uh everything on everything on on politics economics\nToday on freakonomics radio the conversation with the WTO's referred to as a beta about what makes for a successful negotiation\nI Know some people think that everything you need to know your learning kindergarten\nWe talk about whether the global economy is doing as well as the current numbers indicate\nIt's amazing that I Do hear people say oh but the economy as great a horse it's great it hasn't been affected here and which came first the president but the terrorists President Trump didn't just happen you know he didn't just fall from the skies\n... [noise]\n... the problem you have with short but very strong concise and clear\nAh messages sometime is that you get the concern you get to what the problem is so what is annoying that party but what you don't get is clarity about okay so how do we fix this sometimes the answer to this question\nIs very broad the nature and ask for things that clearly are impossible to do a so the option on the other side is to either live with this ... or take action that assumes toward us\nAnd that I think is not the best way to proceed I think what we need to\nIs not only to understand the concern what they need to understand now is so what what do we do now what are the things that we need to do reasonably\nSpeaking that can be done and how to actually you know roll up this leaves work and figure something out that is acceptable to everyone a that's a big challenge\n[noise] so are those challenges being met are those long and hard conversations actually happening or are we in more of a kind of stormy holding pattern at the moment\nI think we are progressively moving forward and making progress I remember\nMaybe a couple of years ago and there was a G ... meeting in in ... ah in China and I are made a a a presentation than I explained the situation of technology and the impact that it had in the labor market\nAnd I gave to cheat or know eighty percent of their jobs lost lost to new technologies\nEverybody was surprised at what and there was just two years ago\nAnd some people came to me right there when we when we broke for coffee\nAnd I said where did you get those numbers are how did you get this information is eight so they're just not looking for it they're not looking for the causes of all this but if we do that causes a pretty evident in two years' time uh everybody's talking about this now this is no news any longer\nAnd some are have already begun to talk about a reforming the system reforming doubled show they realized that some of these concerns have roots in shortcomings of the system and unless we address this\nThese kind of patients that we see today or in terms of trade are only going to increase\nIn addition to a President Trump critiquing the WTO itself calling it a disaster\nOr saying if they don't shape up I Will withdraw 'em and his terrorist activity or the U.S has also been blocking the appointment of a WTO appeals judge without whom the organization could really be a ... to ... to some large degree I'm curious if you could talk about what\nYou are doing to try to keep the WTO from being paralyzed for ... I mean\nWe have to fix the situation as soon as we can by the end of next year or we may reach a a critical moment when we have less than three appellate body members that means that with less than three we cannot hear an appeal\nAnd therefore basically the system of dispute settlement collapses but having said that are members of looking at alternative is the first option of course is to get\nA conversation going ... of the U.S administration or with the disputes settlement mechanism of the WTO is not new uh I myself had heard that before from previous administrations people have been asking so if you're not happy with the system\nWhat do you think needs to change or how do we fix the problems you have of course\nSome things are not negotiable\nThe system will have to continue to be independent it will have to continue to be impartial a buck it can function better than what is also a bit I'm a peculiar is that the United states has been bringing cases to the average Joe they just brought five and a few weeks ago\nSo have you ah director general of NATO had direct conversations ever with President Trump whether about the blocking the appointment of the judge or trade itself generally or anything if you have you had face to face or direct conversations with them\nNot directly no I Do have a open contacts of course with I'm Robert Lighthizer the U.S do our eyes sometimes have conversations um in in different scenarios with other ministers as well but not directly with President Trump no\nHave you had direct conversations with the leaders of other large a country's\nYes I'm quite frequently\nSummit recently with President ... uh from France and um he was very concerned with all this and we had a very very good conversation and\nHe was very much on top of what's happening and that's surprising because I'm a while back whenever I talk to leave there is a it took me a while to\nTo explain to them what was going on that this was not the case now ah talk to him I talked to a prime minister may I I I'm going to be next month in ah in Germany or to talk with a a Chancellor Merkel I recently was in Japan or talk to\nRobbie I'm I've I've been covering a lot of ground and\nWe've been talking and they're all concerned [noise]\nThere is a recent news that are the leaders of Russia and China have gotten together and\nBoosted their newfound strategic a partnership I'm curious how you think about um you know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists\nAnd other countries respond by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to see a conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course it can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but\nUm they're very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance of the system and not to compromise\nThe system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talk to us tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen but it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know do in the line when others are\nComing up after the break with\nThe head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask them to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nThough well don't worry Roberto as a veto has plenty more to say and we'll hear

Bhagwati at Columbia has said this about um the world trading system said it's characterized by a chaotic Criss crossing of preferences\nWith the plethora of different trade barriers applying to products depending on which countries they originate from this is a fool's way of doing trade\nOr it sounds as though you largely agree that uh that we get to where we get through a strange brew of evolution and history and best efforts and things changing over time so let me just leave you with the final question\nIf you as director general of the WTO had for a day or week some kind of magic wand [laughter]\nTo make things more equitable I'm more transparent tell me a few things that you would do to help make a little bit more order and equity out of this chaos\nI think the biggest challenge for us is to have a conversation I Would try to make sure that we give space for more discussions whenever you said if if the two sides or three or four or how many sides\nA want a solution a solution will come I Will give you one anecdote something that happened with me actually uh I was at a negotiating table and we all had very significant political problems at home right\nAnd we were struggling with the language of a provision was very important provision ah for everyone\nAnd in the middle of the conversation I'm somebody said why don't we write this down like this and he gave up you know he'd drafted\nA sentence and I said\nWhat what the hell does that mean I don't understand the centers and the others said I don't either and nobody understood descent that says okay so that's that's gets [laughter]\nNobody knew what it meant it but it it works for everyone precisely because nobody knew what it meant and then we got an agreement so when you want things done you can find a way but you have to sit\nDown and be determined that you want a solution\nI appreciate the call for conversation I assume if President Trump were to hear this conversation and\nCall you um you'd be happy to to go visit and tried to sit down and works and things out yeah I'm always available when I'm always available [noise]\nComing up\nNext on freakonomics radio here's what we typically hear about the relationship between government economic growth my God the government what a basket case the fear that they don't know what they're doing today we'll hear an alternate take on that argument\nFrom the economists Mary on them out to answer more episodes like this one check out our podcast archive on deter or at ... dot com we'll also find our books the blog\nAnd much more freakonomics radio is supported by target preventing future at heart a pint cast on change makers and the contracts they're checking in communities nationwide future and hard and\nThey outlined apple pie and cast or wherever pine cats are found high\nI'm your homeowner I'm the president and CEO of NPR and I want to thank you for the incredible support you have shown Houston Public media local news coverage is disappearing across\nThe country from newspapers from television stations radio stations one of the few places that you can get local news is on public radio and that particularly hold true here\nIn southeastern Texas so thank you so much for your support of Houston Public media news eighty eight seven [noise]\nSometimes you cover tragic events and people want\nThe outside world as far removed as possible for as long as possible but in this case people are are pretty quick to say what's gone wrong in this country that allows this kind of hatred to happen\nI'm Michael Barbaro that's today on the daily from the New York times [noise]\nLook daily this evening ten pm on news eighty seven Houston Public media support\nFor Houston Public media comes from sun trust private wealth management these teams of local advisors can help navigate individuals finances providing wealth management I used to help instill confidence for whatever life brings sun\nTrust dot com slash reserved confidence starts here\nThere's guys Seventy one degrees at the University of Houston\n\n[noise] this is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my past economic Swiss through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely Carl Marx Mary Annette ...
