fail I had never been in an environment that was so emotionally charged actually the reason you're telling your second grade daughter that's just move next week the fight started and I hit her as hard as I can and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son there's no way I'd let them play\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan\nWar they'd be more casual fan and your fellow just a couple of sports teams or maybe pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case when you do see those athletes it's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing the uniform\nPerforming under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life or at least your daily life\nIs that who those people really are they getting so good at this thing they do\nWe see them on TV all you're seeing is the outcome but what were the input\nWe understand that elite athletes represents some magical combination of talents and determination but what about say\nLuck and my gosh uh\nI I yes absolutely I think that a ton of luck involved\nBut Shawn Johnson an American gymnast who's one elliptical metal and many other top honors\nKind of like this miracle math and kind of equation said equal the perfect answer I mean you can't get hurt me healthy you can't have the flu on the wrong day\nYet to find the right ... city of Fort at all these random things and when he like get all the people who fit that equation\nHer not left as many people so I guess I was just the best of the very few that equation and\nToday on freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI Know when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually three is like Armageddon [noise] I'm trying not\nIn today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process how predictable\nWill look at the number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuits well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or\nSo yeah most of the athletes we've heard from were extraordinarily driven and talented but of course they've also had to work incredibly hard at perfecting their craft\nMost of them and we remember Donald Thomas or jumping friend\nDavid Epstein interviewed Thomas's college track coach and\nUsually find him like outside you know should be free throws when he was supposed to be inside learning how to high jump most athletes however do train incredibly important because they're not allowed not to buy the coaches are teams maybe their parents but of course they also push themselves\nI think it's about how much you want it how much you love it and how much you're willing to sacrifice for\nMike ... is a rookie offensive lineman on the San Francisco forty niners he was the nights player chosen in this year's draft\nI was never the best athlete on my team I was I'm I'm Still allowed to best athlete on my on my\nTeam here um but I've always wanted it more I've always worked harder than everybody else and I'm I'm just attention to detail and the things that you need to know how to self correct you need to know how to learn\nKnowing how to learn is particularly valuable when the skills you're trying to learn our unusual\nPlay off of divine as one of the more on natural human movements on earth in sport I think um you're required to move over large man out of the way and\nWhen you're trying to stop them in past protection you're completely moving backwards so it's a really really different thing to have to learn how to do and are\nUntil your body can feel it until you can watch it on film and self diagnosed right when things happen on that's where the separation comes and\nThere's also the fact that the training opportunities and some sports are inherently constrained\nSki racing is a really unique sport in many ways to kill us different when you think about it the actual\nTime that I stand or any race or spend on the hill actually\nSkiing during the day of training let's say you get one course length is about sixty seconds long\nAnd you get seven runs in one training session and that takes about\nSomewhere between three to five hours depending on how how long the ... so you're adding up about seven minutes total of practice and your support for the entire training session which is comparative to say three to five hours of somebody playing tennis in a single session\nWhich makes me feel like the deliberate practice component is that much more central you know there's gears out their teammates of mine in the past to spend their time from the top of the chair left to the top of the race course it could be\nHalf of the trail links that they're skiing down and they're just kind of like flailing about and doing whatever and I was like doing drills to the top of the course\nTrying to make use of every square inch of space on the mountain every time I'm deliberately practicing skiing and my technique and everything that I'm kind of getting a one up on everybody else who's not\nBecause it's so demanding to master the skill set that accompanies each sport whether it's skiing or swimming or football you can imagine an aspiring athlete would want to spend as much time as possible on that skill set and not waste time on say other sports\nThis has become a huge debate in youth sports at what age should an athlete stop playing other sports and commit to there's a lot of young athletes and especially their parents seem to think the best move is to pick your sport early and focus solely on that sport man it drives me nutty Kerry Welsh Jennings\nIt's just I think it's such a flawed place to come from specialization in anything\nI'm let alone when you're a child and you're eight years old you do not need to pick your sport that you are going to maybe get a college scholarship for you know and play three sixty five twenty four seven which is mentally and spiritually and physically just it'll crush you\nSo I have a major problem with the way things are right now and I absolutely know that I and the great athlete because I did everything going up and I wanted to be a great athlete\nYeah I was never that child that turned ten years old and said oh my gosh I Need to give up everything and everyone ingests commit my life the Olympics the gymnast Shawn Johnson I had this you know blue collar family all American Midwest just kind of parents that wanted to be normal and\nThey pay me to be in so many sports and so many activities and\nUm try the oboe and clarinet and piano practice and mock trial and all these things that kind of distracted me from the cell and pick dream that always gave me this perspective of I Love everything that I Love gymnastics more\nAnd so whenever I was an astronaut ethics practice I focused more than any other activity and gave more effort they are because they knew that was my favorite\nThere is some research to back up these stories from Johnson and most Jennings so for example after the last World Cup\nA group of German scientists um published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany that's David obscene and he's talking about the two thousand fourteen World Cup and found that the athletes who went on to the national team which by the way one that World Cup\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training only by age twenty two\nThey start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athletes who plateaued a lower levels so this sort of less structured development [noise]\nAnd turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become like [noise] okay but\nWhat if you are young athlete or the parents of one and your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that Steve ... my freakonomics friend and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about ... four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools and so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing the the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blade says eBay this paperless foil and there's male female fancy and given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like six or seven\nPercent of the kids you ever tried to be sensors end up being college ... about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent ... fine\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs than something like Fifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are\nFencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener\nHow does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball or football or something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or just love it\nI actually won and does so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know his grades aren't that good so she knows and I know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then\nWhen it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or\nDo you would have been and talk to can address the problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\n\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart a

descent to play in the NBA but he barely played and three times that year the warriors send them down to their minor league club\nDuring the NBA's off season he played a few games in China\nThen the Knicks signed him and when sand that he broke out [noise]\nIn\nIs now in his ninth year in the NBA he's in the final season of a three year deal worth thirty eight point three million dollars how could someone worth nearly Thirteen million dollars a year have been assigned a value of essentially zero\nWhat's that one of the people who did take an early look at Jeremy Lin Darryl more a general manager of the Houston Rockets the rockets have been one of the winningest team in basketball during mores tenure and he was just named NBA executive of the year\nMore he was also one of the first executives in basketball to make extensive use of analytics to help choose players so I asked him why Jeremy Lin's college numbers had not lit up his model\nWell and one thing that was talking about Germany 'cause he did actually producing college at a level that look you know insanely well I'm meaning if\nHe had played at say Kentucky Duke or whatever for sure he would have been a top pick in the draft I have no doubt that the problem was he played at Harvard\nA and actually most of the models that are used from an analytical perspective to forecast draft picks they're built on people who are drafted\nAnd Germany didn't look like anyone who was drafted the number of Ivy League players that have become MBA players is extremely small\nSo one of the things you have to be careful both analytics is when did not use things um and I incorrectly chose to not weights uh his time an Ivy League high enough and we he ended up going under after\nMaury end the rockets did however bring when into training camp as an drafted rookie\nShe actually did look quite good in our training camp but unfortunately that time we had four point guards and so yeah we we either an incorrectly let him go\nWhat about his being Asian how much did that just you know the fact that he did not quote look lake what most basketball people think a good basketball player looks like and how much that may have actually obscured the ... the real data\nTo sort of it I Know the question but the founders of behavioral\nScience you know a lot of their research was on yeah how people mostly unconsciously some times overly put people into you know you know basically buckets or or categories and then use those for making decisions and often those here is six really serve you well in life\nI e you know I I've categorize that animal\nIs dangerous and so I'm going to avoid them so they don't eat me right but many times they don't serve you well and and a while you're asking is the question it's a possible answer is basically how\nDid a German heritage or change how he was viewed by NBA talented value waiters um\nI don't know how much was an Ivy League how much it was you know um yeah no nobody knows the reality was it happens or not just in their mid I've been to consistently he was\nA top player in high school and he didn't got literally almost no interest from college had coaches but he should have been recruited by the ... and the Kentucky and then again he was overlooked in the NBA no one can really know\nWhy but there's obviously a bunch of factors that probably played a role in\nThe more you talk to athletes and the people around them the more you realize that the path to elite status isn't nearly as predictable as you might imagine there are cognitive biases involved there's personality in politics\nAnd remember luck plainly there's no guarantee that given an athlete will get the right opportunity to make it to the top but\nAbout if you do get the opportunity that's when the real challenge begins\nNow you've got to work even harder to vote yourself even more completely and that comes with the cost it's the flip side of opportunity and it's what economists call\nOpportunity cost meaning for every hour you spend on your sport\nYou surrendered our something\nEvery opportunity to sport gives you there's another opportunity you have to sacrifice\nSo fighting takes up a lot of time and um you know fighters they have to diet pretty hard\nBorn Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the ... weight division of UFC\nTo work out all the time they also need to rest a lot of us work so they're just not a lot of time in the day\nIn a lot of times the first thing that kind of gets taken off the plate is time with family and so I remember missing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners um you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family kind of being like what the hell why you know why are you suddenly neglecting not so much and ah [noise]\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nIn high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share I didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff\nIn the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego\nOther opportunities\nThat again is Dominique Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to make in computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that costs are going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that so instead\nYou did was it American studies at American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football you\nKnow I I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay all that to say once I got to the league then I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox where he played long enough to enter free agency is final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years\nHe's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me closer to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends and including family and\nAnd then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nI mean I think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost ... focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and\nI'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature the quote but it's something to the effect of a when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I was single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I\n... the people who I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like and I'm like\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought were choices to get me what you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was for going like lasting long lasting relationship
