V. eight point six she used to [noise]\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat of big tank and\nMy argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago this book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nThat since become relevant just because they fired a respect for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow\nThem when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired his name is Barry Lynn and he ran something called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nWe used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of\nAmerica this week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at\nNo point did Google for any ... to ...\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house down there\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists\nI worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we shouldn't say it was a pro business magazine [noise] we were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses\nSo we had a real inside look at how global positioning actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hills to earn to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was\nRepresents the exercise of power which they attempt to use their own private wealth to affect public outcomes or to produce public benefits or make social change [noise]\nAnd power deserves scrutiny and a democratic society not gratitude I'd add on top of that the foundation in particular which is a a a legal form that allows a wealthy person to create a donor directed unaccountable barely trance parent\nPerpetual and tax\nSubsidized corporate form\nIn order to use their private assets to affect the public uh me as a especially um interesting and potentially worrisome form of power\nLet's talk about think tanks per se um is there such a thing as a truly nonpartisan think tank or is it just too hard because of where the money's coming from\n[noise] ... well I I'd say that\nYou're more likely to make the case that there are a non partisan universities or universities which are funded in not entirely dissimilar ways from think tanks I'm a well officially they have to be nonpartisan so so do think tanks to in other words they can't declare themselves in favor of particular political candidates but think tanks\nHad become far more popular in the United states as a result of the polarization and inequality United States so that the idea generation that happens in think tanks in the policy framework some proposals that gets disseminated from think tanks\nFlow from philanthropic interests with particular policy positions and mine\nTell me what you know about Google's history of philanthropic or ... foundation or think tank giving and especially the timeline because I understand that accelerated quite a bit recently yeah so Google like lots\nOf other tech firms has gotten much more aggressive in its formal lobbying efforts and I think it's now the case that the top five Silicon Valley companies um are amongst the largest sources of lobbying um greater even than the five top Wall Street firms and I'm In New York\nAnd there's been a parallel um wrapping up of the ... that's associated with the tech firms that find three comes in a variety of different forms\nSo Rob knowing what you know about the situation with the New America foundation and the Google money and the controversy what would your advice be for them for the New America foundation\nThe New America foundation needs to be aware\nOf the soft power\nThe agenda setting influence that donors can have\nTo the think tank even in the absence of calling somebody up and saying we disagree or we object to the work that someone does\nSo when Emory slaughter whose job is chiefly to ensure the existence of of the New America foundation into the future which involves fundraising\nDoes her work she needs to be cautious that she hasn't internalized the policy preferences of the donors\nSuch that she shapes the work of the foundation around the donor interests\nThe idea is you're worried about the conversation you'll have with your donor in the future and so you orient the work that you do to please the donor rather than to displace the donor and that has functionally the same outcome from the donors perspective without even having to say anything\nNow your own fine university Stanford\nBenefited was founded from the large as a private largest ... Stanford who\nYou know most of history paint him as a classic Robert bearing a railroad at the end who uh who did all kinds of stuff that we would frown upon today talk to me about that and whether that's a conversation that takes place regularly at Stanford or is it avoided\nSo I'd say people here are aware of\nThe history of the university and the deep connection between philanthropy and the wellbeing of especially well the universities\nAre people here I think you know something about the history of legal in Stanford and ah so there is an effort on campus too on earth the sordid history of the universities initial benefactor\nHas there been any movement of any kind of magnitude to rename the\nUniversity not that I Know of their starting with lower hanging fruit other monuments and places on campus named for people with no obvious connection to the university and who's historical records are not so appealing so let's\nSay I have some money Rob name your figure and I want to set up a foundation came in I come to you and I say you know I'm a big believer in bringing critics into the inner circle and I know that you've been critical of how foundations behave\nAnd that it's undemocratic and so on but you know Rob I'd like to make you the director\nMy foundation the executive of my foundation and let's say I made my money in a\nAmmonia fertilizer how would you go about setting it up in a way that takes advantage of my large efforts to try to accomplish something that we could all agree some kind of public good without falling into all the traps that you've been describing to\nUs so at first I'd say despite the fact that laws don't require me to be especially transparent about what the foundation is doing\nI pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we do the evaluations of the grants that we make I Want to invite in outside experts as well and I would want to find ways in which to or\nAnd as the foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we were doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a form of foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic evidence of corporations were purely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often and their philanthropy I'm trying to\nStimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question\n[noise] that was the

statistically speaking you're almost certainly not but if you are you know that the open championship for what Americans called the British Open the oldest and arguably most important major tournament in golf this summer it was won by ... the first Italian\nTo ever win a major and it was held at the infamous Scottish course ... which is so difficult it's often called her nasty ... also hosted the open back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nThe golf course was so hard\nThat it inevitably was going to give us some bizarre conclusion that Randall simply he played on the PGA Tour for Fifteen Years now he's an analyst for the golf channel there was going to be a train wreck at some point and yet on the tournaments final day on the final hole sit a man who would tamed Savage course\nAnd basic factors that they were taking into account in order to actually decide how they were going to\nPut the ... so their argument is that there's really skilled you're actually generating our rich description here of the situation so you're trying to take into account your how basically the ball would roll and where you need to aim in order to have the appropriate ... path\nSo I Know that some psychologist argue that what separates the better performers the top tier performers from the rest of us is you know some form of auto ... right that you're going into some free flowing state is dependent on all your talent inexperienced et cetera but you're not\nActually engaging in a cognitively you're saying that's not what you found\nWhat we're finding is that experts are able to make adjustments you know when they're performing so if you're a musician and the acoustics them in a given performance environment is different you can actually make\nAdjustments and the same way the soccer player you know when the situation changes they can actually make adjustments appropriate to that situation\nSo let me ask you this Anders to what degree do you believe that choking is the factor or a main factor that actually separates an absolute topped your performer\nFrom someone who's talented and so on but doesn't reach the top tier in other words is the expert is the professional the very good performer who has learned to not joke\nMy experiences the choking is quite rare by those individuals that we study who are consistently excelling and it it seems to be almost part of being an expert is that you deal with the kind of situations that would be you know experience was very high pressure for other people\n[noise] so that's an interesting continuum high pressure performances can lead to choking but experts performers who could be under pressure all the time and to not show of course it does happen for me it was terrifying\nJeremy Abbott was one of the best figure skaters in the world he won the U.S men's championship four times and went to the Olympics in two thousand ten and two dozen fourteen things didn't go so well at the Olympics\nOpening where the quiet town right here [noise] sure have rotation not that many hard fall there\nThis is disastrous performance who is\nUnlike any other situation I'd ever been in all of my practice and all of my preparation\nUh once I got to the games everything really kind of leading up to that moment both Olympics in Vancouver and in Sochi I was really excited I could see the rings and the moment I went out uh in Vancouver and in Sochi\nEvery and security that I had about myself and about my skating was just magnified by a million\nI'm and I was just so focused on not wanting to make a mistake I was in the wrong mindset\nBoth times Abbott failed to metal in the individual events he retired from competitive skating in two thousand sixteen and you know coaches in Detroit he uses his own experience to help the next generation\nI should've been focusing less on outcome a and less on um performance and more just on the process and and getting my job done and ... and accomplishing what I Do every single day in training and and really taking all of that experience\nA and all of that work\nAnd putting it to use rather than focusing on what is that what if this uh you know\nAnything could happen um but whenever I stated my past it was never focusing on a placement or up a point total or pleasing somebody else it was always just OK I'm here I'm going to do a job and that was one I always get it my best\n[noise] yeah that's precisely those times when you do start thinking too much that you can fly a performance the on by luck again and so [noise] any situation that causes you to attend\nIn ways that you might not normally can mess you up [noise] so can I just say I love\nOur species I think we're kind of awesome I mean we had some flaws and so on but doesn't it seem a like a weird counterbalance that we tend to choke most in the circumstances as you've been telling us that matter the most to assume that just seem like a design flaw\n[laughter] um it is interesting I mean I guess you could say that maybe we haven't adapted to those situations yet I mean we've certainly been in social situations for a long time but um our level of self consciousness and and medical cognitive\nAbility the ability to know what we and others are thinking of something that probably fairly recent evolutionarily wise [noise] so we should probably take\nA look at how we think differently and perform differently as the

profit that may be subtle and hard\nTo measure economists look at choking differently\nSay that you would have paid me a million dollar ... gave the best interview of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about [noise] two ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that you felt pay you more you'll put more effort into task into second assumption\nIs that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that I can push you so much to to try so hard to really actually backfire immediately perform worse\nBeen easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large states and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is that the ... our money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months of salary in our experiment if they did

were athletic throwing a dark like ... balls so balls on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten dollar was about what they made in the month over there I open to to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you work much harder
