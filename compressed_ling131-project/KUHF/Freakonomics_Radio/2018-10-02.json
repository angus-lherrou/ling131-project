tomorrow nine and six AM on news eighty seven Houston Public media Seventy six degrees at the University of Houston [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDid you and your grandfather bought the San Francisco forty niners in Nineteen Seventy seven you paid Seventeen million dollars you know obviously the team is probably worth a little bit more than ... says you know even today that is true Forbes estimates the forty niners value at three billion dollars making it the tenth most valuable sports team in the world\nThat's without having won the super bowl since Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd that's with winning two games in two thousand sixteen what would happen if a soccer team in the English Premier League did that\nThey'd get relegated to a lower league and their finances would crumble the Premier League would give them what's called a parachute payment to help them avoid bankruptcy but they'd have to sell off their best players an NFL team wins just two games meanwhile still\nThat two hundred and fifty million dollar check from the home office I actually joke with my English from their friends that's out we do the forty niners president\nNot only do when we lose we actually get gifted\nBetter draft picks [laughter] they actually get relegated down and have to try to come back up so the football business I mean I Would love to be an NFL owner because it's a it's kind of a closed model right I mean if you're in you literally can't lose I mean can you lose money in the NFL uh\nSure I mean if you're if you're one of the lower revenue to your clothes but it's hard if you are your points three hours\nI asked ... to describe his duties as club president I oversee everything non football\nSo I'm thinking about the sales and marketing gene a functions of the team ... is a general ministry of finance human resources legal\nOr insurance all those things land development\nLand development in particular is a big piece of the forty niners value proposition as it is for many sports franchise\nIt's no coincidence that so many team owners made their money in real estate this includes Jed York slate grandfather\nHe was one of the first people to really take you know the downtown to suburbia and he really enclose a shopping mall and built to a great empire there\nOn one level owning an NFL team is a real estate play yes the athletes are necessary to carry out the game but athletes come and go stadium is the constant and it's a cash cow on at least three dimensions\nAs a stage set for the lucrative TV contracts as a venue for live events including of course the football games\nAnd as a sponsorship opportunity in two thousand fourteen the forty niners built and moved into a one point three billion dollar state of the art stadium it's now called Levi stadium after the genes make her pay two hundred and twenty million dollars for ten year named deal [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe modern stadium like Levis can generate a lot more revenue than old stadium thanks to luxury sweets and the willingness of fans to pre purchased season tickets the forty niners like most teams don't just sell you a ticket and you first need to buy what's called a personal license\nWhich then allows you to buy the ticket and Levi stadium opened those licenses sold for two thousand eighty thousand dollars per seat depending on location\nAbout Ninety five Ninety six percent of the building is sold out on season tickets to another way to air to other NFL Stadiums that about typical or a little high very high it is very high here we are in this awkward silence team revenues inside of the NFL\nKeep in mind the NFL teams only have a regular season home games per season with a couple of pre season games and if they're lucky a playoff game or two\nThat is not very efficient use of an asset as expensive as a brand new high tech stadium\nBut don't worry the forty niners are active landlords to according to Forbes Levi stadium in its first three years hosted more non NFL events than any other new stadium here's Bob laying the forty niners VP of communications well giving us a stadium tour back in may\n[noise] yeah we went straight from monster truck into Taylor Swift rang a last weekend and then now as soon as Taylor Swift got off the field um they're putting down a saw because we've got a soccer match coming up short\n... or\nSo from a business perspective the forty niners of the mid two thousand teens were doing quite well monetize their beautiful new real estate investment taking in their steady share of the NFL's billions the only problem was that the actual football team staying\nOver three seasons from two thousand fourteen two thousand sixteen they want a total just\nFifteen games the New England patriots won fourteen games in two thousand sixteen\nAlone the forty niners for winning just two games that year that was also the season or the forty niners quarterback became the talk of not just the NFL but the entire country Colin Kaepernick\nJohn Lynch as GM was a bit of a stretch he'd never been a football coach or executive but he had been a great player and he was smart he played is college football at Stanford there was one more thing going for Lynch he's just a presence prog rock to again\nHe has such an amazing presence you just ... year round and for half an hour and it makes you want to be a better version of yourself\nAnd so it came to pass that in early to thousands Seventeen a few weeks after firing their previous head coach and general manager the forty niners had their new leadership do will end up and coming young coach and an inspiring first time GM\nNow all I had to do was get the kind of players who could win them some football games like this guy\nSolomon's almost opposite effects on the surface of what an honor\nThomas was born in Chicago and his family moved to Australia for several years and then to Texas was a big kid so naturally in Texas\nFrom like Romney playing football\nAnd I was like are I mean I really don't know what to boys and\nAh so we find out the the um [noise] ... first practice and going out there was talk wearing a cigar in front of me 'cause I Know what to do is a federal Abbas\nThomas figured out the game pretty quickly now Thomas was one of the key young players the forty niners we're rebuilding their defense around the often meanwhile that was kind of sand hand specialty the fence needed even more help especially quarterback\nI mean that's the toughest to me position in the world and there's all there's thirty two teams and there is an thirty two people who can play that position at the level\nNeeded I mean if you look at the AFC I think over the last Seventeen and Nineteen years it's basically been three quarterbacks\nThat forty niners president out we do again\nSo it was Tom Brady Peyton Manning Ben Roethlisberger sprinkle in a few Joe flat goes and that's it\nWith Colin Kaepernick gone the forty niners best quarterback options were CJ battered and Brian holier neither of whom were very good options\nBut Shanahan and John Lynch and the whole organization knew it'd be hard work to turn things around and does anything Kyle Shanahan is really really really good at it is working hard during the\nSeason you know Monday's I'm I'm usually in about five thirty every day I leave on a Monday at eleven on a Tuesday at midnight on a Wednesday at midnight on a Thursday at nine thirty and on friday I leave it at two thirty fried is like my weekend where I get home\nAbout three thirty and that's and I kind of held my kids Saturday you know I'm In at five thirty years you're traveling somewhere or we have meetings\nWalks or I go home for two hours and go to the hotel unit of the night of the team hotel in yeah everyone does um and then on Sundays more at\nThe stadium very early in the morning\nYou hear these stories forever about coaches you know literally sleeping in their offices working these hours that you describe like I think anybody listening this those that were found\nTotally nuts\nAnd my thought is always like\nDoes it really have to be like what is like for people who don't know the game or care about it and they hear like wait a minute you're football coach I Do I Need to be working Eighteen hour I don't what are you doing\nI Will just on a Monday alright\nAs a as a head coach and I need to watch the game for myself which is often suicide defense aside special teams rewind fast forward sideline copy and so like there's three close before we get best one play on one side of the ball and I got to watch it with the coaches\nAnd then when I saw and I got to get the whole team together and I got to watch certain clubs that team from head coach standpoint than they anyways it takes all Monday Ari takes all Monday and now we've got to start watching um Seattle who we play the next Sunday\nFor the next several minutes Shanahan describes in exhausting detail and the rest of the week\nWell I teach the past name for me to not only teach the wrong game from nine to attend and our special teams\nComes comes in from ten to ten forty five seed specialty and then we go out on the field and we have to walk through all the new stuff we learn when we come back in and we launched and we'd go out and have a real process\nOut before tomorrow we got to go study or down the other studies shore yard his goal I got to draw the plan put them on cars are going practiced tomorrow we'll need a red zone on Thursday night all friday's same process member um\nLittle Evan geysers eleven guys from its incident and how many different things you can do and if one guy is off the play doesn't work on either side of the ball and that that plays on words that can be a her quarterback will be a touchdown and\nThat could be the reason you're telling your second grade daughter that she's moving next week drew\n[noise] Mm\nYeah there's there's not many other ways to do I know it was embarrassing or not ... or so and the sun but like I don't try to explain to even watch cause is laughable and anybody ever\nTried as any coach ever said you know what maybe all those hours that were working if we slept more we'd be sharper and try to make up for it that way as anybody ever tried a totally different approach or yeah toy and those are no longer\nGuys you would never another name and I mean it's\nIt's okay if we're tired and we barely can function either we don't have performed the play it's us wearing our brains out all week to put it\nOr players and the best
