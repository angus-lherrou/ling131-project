household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states you grow up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but he settled in in his wife started raising their family here\nHe worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up\nThis went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAs someone who's been in business a lot before and after your political time I guess grubby or corrupt or unworkable is politics compared to business\nIn New York City the amount of so called grogginess was I think minimal pretty much the only times that we had real problems which certain exceptions to this was when somebody from the state legislature actually gotten involved\nYou know here's a good story of of grogginess as we decide to re zone the waterfront in Brooklyn\nAfter World War two New York city literally lost almost all of its manufacturing and so the waterfront which had these spectacular views of Manhattan across the river had essentially been abandoned so it was\nYou know dilapidated War Z and warehouses and factories and so we decided we were going to turn it into you know one of the more desirable parts of New York fit for sort of eight twenty first century economy [noise]\nSo uh we worked on this ... owning for about two years this was while I was bidding for the Olympics I literally on the day before the vote in the city council I arrived back from Korea where I was you know lobbying for votes\nAnd I called in the city hall because there was a snack in our re zoning it turns out that the state representative you know veto Lopez from the district\nHad his hand out and what he wanted was a million dollars for a daycare center that I think his girlfriend had some involvement and\nAnd I literally after midnight called the head of the agency that oversaw sort of daycare centers woke him up in the middle of the night I'd never actually talked to him before I said you know you don't know me but I Need a favor\nCan I count on you for the million dollars for this day care center he said gras goalie yes and we got the deal done yet sometimes there are just like insurmountable obstacles they usually occurred at the state level the politics there really can be awful\nAt one point I think the New York times counted up and something like thirty five legislators had been convicted of various crimes\nThat included um the speaker of the state assembly as well as the Senate majority leader and let's not forget governors Eliot Spitzer of course we're Eliot Spitzer to\n'em and so we try to avoid the state honestly as much as possible but sometimes we just couldn't avoid them a good example of that was\nThe stadium on the west side of Manhattan as part of the Olympic bid and as part of the Hudson Yards plan we propose a stadium over part of the rail yards that are on the west side\nAnd you know we just couldn't find a way to get around the state legislature and eventually this really one guy who was the speaker of the assembly who's been convicted of corruption\nBlocked it without a vote and did it for lots of reasons none of which I'm sure we'll ever know including the fact that he had a cozy relationship with Madison Square garden which opposed it I mean it was sort of went on and on and on\n\nComing up after the break what cities should and should not do to keep corporations happy\nProviding these sorts

Sony and Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline\nI mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital\nIf you begin to carve most of that back you can create greater density you can also however dramatically increase the amount of public open space if you can begin to put people very close to open space and you can figure out ways\nTo weather rise that particularly in places like Toronto where the weather is not so nice a large percentage of the time\nThen maybe you can begin to re conceive space in people's apartments in New ways which will also be enhanced by enabling people to store a lot of their stuff off site because with autonomous delivery it'll be much easier and convenient\nAnd you combine that with new approaches to construction like modular construction or perhaps cross laminated timber\nThen you can begin to meaningfully lower the cost of housing combined look lowering the cost of housing with lowering the cost of mobility which we believe is really possible by as much as fifty percent and you can begin to see cost of living decreases that are\nMeaningfully end of the double digits\nKnow the people who live there as I understand it are opting in to a program to have a great deal of their personal data gathered because this is a laboratory and you want to learn as much as you can from the day to help people move around and communicate and so on\nOne interview you gave you said that the data really shouldn't be used to be commercialized um but this is a project run by funded by a company Google for whom commercializing data is it's actual business models so\nWhy on earth would we think that these data won't be commercialized and why on earth shouldn't we think that this entire project is just an extension of Google's already monolithic reach\nWe're just going to have to demonstrate to people through agreements engagement um specific actions that that's not our intent at all and by the way it's not Google or alphabet some time at all either\nOur purpose here is to demonstrate how\nThat combination of innovation and urban design can fundamentally bend the curve on quality of life and\nTo extent data gets used it's going to get used for those purposes but we have to prove it to people and memorialize that in different ways and that we will do so we understand the\nSkepticism and we will satisfy people over the course of two thousand and Eighteen which has our year to really put the plan together\nIncluding privacy and data protection plans of our intentions\nSo yeah I mean what I Believe in something I call the virtuous cycle and successful city\nYou know the object of a city should be to grow and that is grow the number of residents grow the number of jobs grow the number of visitors\nBecause the marginal revenue of those additional people is greater than the marginal cost and that you can take that net profit\nIf you will and reinvest it back in quality of life in the city and affordable housing and education and safety and social services and when you do that and you improve quality of life more people calm\nPerpetuating the virtuous\nWhen can I moved there\nWell if all goes well you know the first people could probably move in and maybe five years or so but then that would be a place to proto type a lot of the interesting ideas and approaches\nBut obviously a lot of the systems have to scale into a larger area this is a project that would take Fifteen to
