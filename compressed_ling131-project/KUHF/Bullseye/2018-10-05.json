friday by a powerful earthquake then inundated by us you know I mean that's a lot of attention on the humanitarian crisis that followed\nBut I Want to focus on the geological setting that made the city's kinda loop population three hundred and fifty thousand so vulnerable\nThe phrase ring of fire is being thrown around but that's only half true\nSee the laziest sent back from the main ... Pacific tectonic activity but it is cool Tina complex network of geological fools squeezing and bending it every which way and one of them runs right on to have a\nJob I just feel ... very well I think produced a comprehensive seismic hazard map of the region only two years ago\n... as a city that sits in a sort of long gated Polly valley\nAnd that is a long awaited along a big fault called the public or a fault which is the strike slip fault which has considerable relative movement four to six centimeters a year of movement along it and that's quite rapid for fault so it has very high potential to rupture in large earthquake as it seems to have done\nAn strike slip means that one side to sort of moving north on one side is moving south roughly\nThat's right to the side of moving north in the west side as moving so\nSo how much movement walls that and how much if not full broke on friday\nThat's a good question I mean it it varies of course along the fault but let's say the U.S just so we had about six major maxim slip but I also saw satellite analysis to suggested about five or six meters slip extended all along the fall through pollen itself\nAnd that's one of the important things as I understand it is that although the earthquake started some distance away they sprayed and Polly itself was moved it was broken by this as quick\nThat's right that seems to be what happened the thing is the fault goes essentially right through Palo at skirts the western edge of the city but it's right there and if you were close to that that would be very violent shaking\nIn a sense I'm getting a picture of ... because she illogical history being incredibly vulnerable to all kinds of consequences of an earthquake like this\nFirst of all is right on the fall to some as narrow valley that's right on the fault this valley is filled with very soft sediments in the sediments can amplify the seismic waves and they're also as we've seen recently subject to liquid faction and then it's right next to ... bay in which Saddam is can be generated\nAnd when you talk about liquid French and that's basically when the soil tunes liquid ... you know they just stopped folding buildings up that's exactly right once the questions I had see non said A's how long it took full the suit ... to arrive after the shaking had happened\nYeah no one really knows very well because until now we haven't had any data but I did just see that there was some tied gauge records from policy which suggests less than ten minutes of travel time if the timing needs to be believed that suggests about ten minutes which is extraordinarily short travel time for this nominee\nAnd you can turn that into a distance because I guess you have a decent idea of how false as soon as he weighs move\nYes you can it depends on the imagery so you have to look at the cemetery and sort of trace ... back and I think it would have to be generated in ... bay certainly not up around and all the way the epicenter was\nAn people when they heard about the nominees recently they've been these subduction full like you have off Japan and off Sumatra when the whole see big changes it shaped Maxwell pushes the walls to call them and that's not the case I proceed with the strike slip this kind of sliding motion\nWell that's right so the subduction zones are what are we call thrust earthquakes for when we're the plates are being pushed together in one sort of pop up and down and that of course pushes water and and that's what causes the Saddam\nWhere's this fall to the strike slip fault so it involves side by side motion and it doesn't necessarily push the water up or down you know it does a little bit but it's far less efficient engineering some army than subduction zone earthquakes typically\nHowever in this case there could be two things at play you're one would be\nSubmarine landslides the sides of the ... bay are relatively steep and there could have been slumping or land fighting generated underneath the water along that bay that could be one factor in general and slowly but also there might be conflicts fault and we've had the fault\nOn the east side of Polly bay and that seems to switch then to the west side so there might be something happening between those two strands of the fault that led to uplift underneath the bay so it's still hard to say this point which of those costs to smell me\nBut presumably if they go out to map the seabed like what kind of thing I can say anything important to do so\nWell I think it's important to do so presumably it's not as easy as it sounds yes you can map the sea bed and you could look for a landslide scarves\nAll the issues the after effects that you don't really know how fast the landslide was and that's a critical parameter in determining the phenomena generation of his really fast it will be more effective in generating so now I mean it won't be open and shut case so to speak\nThere's been a lot of comments about the tsunami warning system that but what strikes me is that these ten minutes if that's the right time isn't incredibly short time for people to read to end this thing and you can find people had buildings collapsing around and\nOnly a few minutes before the sea mommy arrived it strikes me is a really difficult and dangerous situation for people living in that area\nThat's right that's a very very short time and as as the message with a local thing on like this to me that are generated you know right off shore the shaking is warning so if you feel very strong shaking and that means the kind of shaking that makes it difficult to stand in that last for\nTens of seconds you really need to head up hill as soon as you can as soon as sick to do so you should proceed to high ground\nBefore we finish you know this is one full which possibly has released its energy for the meantime ... pseudo lazy itself seems to be the most appalling need complicated tectonic setting that seems to be ... with a place\nThat's true there are quite a few faults and ... they're the ones that cut through the center of the public coral and associated fault but also in the north is a very active subduction zone and they're also a couple of active coastal false up there so yeah there are quite a few faults and some of these salts go right near population center\nAnd along with that you also now have this volcano supports on which she's now erupting\nI have to us you know either the consequences of what just happened or just shows us how geologically active that whole area is\nYeah it's really hard to say for sure when more than a corrupt pins are triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of ... or connected by the stress field in the interviewer for the earthquake will cause a purpose to distrust field and that might have some kind of\nInfluence on the magnetic plumbing system of a volcano it's more likely to happen if the walking was already close to a rupture and then it just took the the stress perturbation or this passage of the seismic waves to sort of push it over the edge and forget about her ruptured that's certainly possible but it's really hard to tell
