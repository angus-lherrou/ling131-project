that said that against what it's called the federal ... act and then another thing that some people are are suggesting is that the federal government could also look at whether the church and the

highlighted some some awful cases but it was suggested that because of the statute of limitations that couldn't be any prosecutions changed\nYeah that's right so there has been shoot priests that have

think probably the biggest those on the largest city on it at that time\nA thousand square kilometers I mean yeah in far off ... London or daily it's today\nYeah that's right it's enormous by any standard in in comparison with for example London during the same time period it was a monster of a city and how many people that's an excellent question and effectively unanswerable because we simply don't have the historical fidelity to answer that but the estimates range from seven hundred and fifty thousand up to ... million\nBut again those numbers are very rubbery and it really depends he took to\nWhat everyone agrees on was this open a gray area and since he was sustained by an enormous sum critical network of ... miles ultimately the weak point ... has been studying\nIt's an interesting system when you look at it the water distribution network achieved several things it was a multi functional network\nIn Maine was providing irrigation water to agricultural fields of course and we'll say domestic water supply but it also played a role in mitigating flooding in the city so a large volumes of order was sorting enormous reservoirs some of which were\nSixteen square kilometers in area the single reservoir on and storing many millions of cubic meters of water so these systems which fed those reservoirs and the canals which captured surface water flow\nWere designed also to mitigate the risk of flooding and what is it very seasonal environment so this is critical infrastructure to the functioning and flows of the city when I was active\nAnd am I right but what you be looking at is the ... that infrastructure played that in the demise of this extraordinary civilization\nYeah that's right I think we need to make an important distinction here in the sense that we're not talking about the demise of a civilized nation but rather the fragmentation of into the network certainly what we suspected for some time is this very large and very complex system was severely damaged by flooding\nIn the latter part of the fourteenth century and we know that in some way to kill I did with that period of extreme climate variability during the ... century [noise]\nHow many have long suspected that the functioning of the critical infrastructure that was represented by this would've distribution network was somehow interrupted\nAnd that led to sexual outcome that we say and they say the relocation at the Capitol\nI mean it's a very interesting phrase somewhere in your paper about cascading failure so it sounds like some parts of the system was pushed over the edge of men they bought ... it'll files\nYeah I think the cascade is critical to this argument and that's what we saw to determine precisely whether they would be a cascading new system given certain conditions and we are all very familiar with the things we experience them as blackouts in various infrastructure all networks that we rely on his part of a die earlier than lives\nAnd so effectively the argument here is that you can have a very small disruption to one component of the system which can then propagate out very rapidly to create a much larger outage that maybe network wider release tech how large parts of it were effectively compromising it's cool function\nSo you're saying it's a bit like when the electric power system goes down it might be just one link that goes down and then it brings the rest and you're saying but one Lincoln this canal network march of gone than others followed\nYeah to exactly right and it's precisely like a a power outages the very small disruption which might be simple as an overload switching station somewhere can actually create a problem which may be much much much larger and more significant\nSo he said that there was an overload of some salt related to these monsoons\nYeah precisely said the ... talking about in the system is not an electrical obviously but it relates to a period of a particularly wet monsoons during the latter part of the fourteenth nearly Fifteen centuries which sits between two very large and prolonged drought so this was a period of\nQuite dramatic climatic instability so the evidence of the damage created by these floods this overload as you say is very clear and the landscape very easily measured what we wanted to know was does that damage create a cascade with tech have this entire system\nAnd I'm just sort of try and work out how it would do what was the failure of one come out have a sense of the whole network of canals\nYeah it's an interesting question that relates to a feedback between erosion which you might expect in a flood situation and said imitation which you might not necessarily expect so al model estimated the dynamics of erosion instead of ... in these canals systems given a sit in magnitude of flooding\nWhat we found was if you're putting more water down the canal which is not designed for\nYou will trigger incision and that's precisely what we say in the reminds of the network has single canal I writing down into its paid several nations in doing so begins to style of flow from other parts of the network\nIn of course ... there's a feedback between erosion and said I'm In ... in a concentration of flow into a single pathway through the network\nEffectively stopping most of the network of water a day by fracturing the system breaking it into small compliance which no longer functioning\nI think is pretty amazing this cascade of events could bring to its knees this great just sit on the climate\nAnd indeed and it's an interesting question whether this was the act that caused that shift from encore to the cycle middle periods cities closer to modern capital of no pin\nOr whether this was simply the final event mocking the end of a city which was becoming increasingly unwieldy and increasingly irreparable so it's an interesting question with a this was the ... or whether it was
