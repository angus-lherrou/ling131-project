O. two from the atmosphere one headline from oil company ... massive read for station\nAnd then put the report was into the territory of agriculture the business of feeding the seven billion and rising mouse on our planet itself a major source of greenhouse gases\nSo appropriate a second report appeared in makeshift shortly afterwards headlined ... since uh keeping the food system within environmental limits\nExamining not just the climate but ooh ecological impacts of farming lead off a marker spring when came into the studio told me the pointless to see where sustainability nice food security\nEnvironment in health I really two of the fundamental pillows that determine welfare broadly defined so we started from the point that we have to be able to feed a growing population in the future a healthy diet\nWithout wrecking the environment's so therefore we looked at both healthy dietary patterns and ways to limit the environmental impact of the food system\nAnd you can break the impact status of five category so I think the principal water which is the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide dissolved but as a whole range of aspects that you're looking at\nYeah what we know is that the food system really has tremendous impact on the environment on the range of different issues you named greenhouse gas emissions but it also occupies about forty percent of the earth land surface it extracts Seventy percent\nOf global fresh water resources and over ... have already led to dead zones in oceans where you don't have oxygen anymore and fish died\nSo he goes fertilizers or things like large traits which are manufactured in big factories and then put from the field\nWe looked at nitrogen and phosphorus application those are the two big chemicals that are also responsible for aquatic pollution Monday run off the field\nBecause then comes to the second step in your analysis this idea of a pilot treat boundary [noise] they seem they say there's a concept to me\nYet they're a little bit vague so they are intended to describe a safe operating space for humanity so if we don't see them then we're sort of find we at conditions that we know we can operate with\nAnd the idea is if you're a seat them then you run the risk that something goes havoc so to say so to give you an example for climate change it would be if we pass a certain limited for example one point five degree warming to degree warming then we have a higher occurrence of extreme weather events drought flooding and song\nFor phosphorus and nitrogen we might have excessive pollution of water systems with more occurrences of those dead zones and also with the other ones I mean you would interfere with ecosystems speed farmers are to global hedge logical cycle\nAnd your analysis applies to now I'm twenty fifty was a simple question aren't we already operating beyond the Planetree boundaries in that sense\nYes we are we know that we have already emitted quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so the climate change boundaries really at risk of being crossed and we also know we uh in several regions applying to much fertilizers so those two things already into dangerous soon so to say\nThat to go back to the feet security if we're already over ... marks are you looking at some areas by which we couldn't go on feeding a bigger population while reducing this impacts\nYeah absolutely or at least not increasing them right I mean for fertilizer application we need to reduce for greenhouse gas emissions we need to reduce but there are several things at our disposal booth which we can do that I mean we know that some regions really over fertilize they don't need to fertilize that much to crops will grow with a bit less fertilizer is well\nSame with a bit less water use so a big part of this whole scenario exercise is really\nWhat needs to be done globally and in different regions so if we were to let's say ... the educational fertilizers from over applying reaches beyond applying regions then we wouldn't have a net increase but more food available for people\nI mean it sounds hopeful but on the other hand if people are applying to much fertilizer or even now suggests that you're dealing with people who are making very good decisions\nThe thing is they don't have good tools at their disposal either so we know if you really properly money into how much you apply to fields and if you know how much your crops need\nThen you can really be a balance that much better and some countries mostly in high income countries have those technologies and they don't over fertilized to that degree so it's really a question of how can you make available those best available management practices to a growing number of regions predominantly low income regions\nThat some of the production and the other one which we're often told me about your world surveys is about the ... the change of diet this I think Courtney important pressure it all of this as the will become stricter\nYeah exactly we know that once people have more money they usually spend it on so called higher value foods and among those are neat pro dogs but also fruits and vegetables but processed foods and we know that isn't very good for your health nor is it very good for the environment because many animal\nSource foods have a high impact on the environment just because they're so inefficient converters of feet into calories that we eat\nYourself semester I was expecting you to come in and sort of be do being gloomy and you seem to see a lot of hope it all the face another ... to this is as a huge amounts of starvation even now even with a scene efficient system\nYeah that's right we know though that we could already now feeds the current population much more healthy leave without all that stuff ... so a problem is really inequality in the food system so high income countries consume too much income countries consume too little and almost everybody consumes the wrong stuff\nSo if we were there to visit gay realign the food system and really clearly communicate what is a healthy diet then I think we would be in a better place\nAnd this is the weeks since the\nPCC the inter governmental panel on climate change has come out with a special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these projections or against a changing global climate was presumably if they didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not to happen then for example we could expect reduction in yields yet other changes in the eyes of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the other patient measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if you go on on our trajectory what we protected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring been from the Oxford monitoring program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere I think really false making a cool to have well generational ready and move into assisted by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power suggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power is only ... connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be\nCool to get down but that's not quite the argument to most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporate water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct patient of that energy and the wins that matters that's hardly important\nWhat matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate constantly\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't get a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil what what is it it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city":
