that they\nPass off relatively peacefully and there is a ... an agreed outcome people can agree on who got elected to the parliament\nBut there is a a very real risk that the elections will be messy because those who are trying to run the elections are facing\nAn incredible task\nMuch of the country is controlled by the Taliban the console holding their this means that turnout may end up being much lower than in previous elections but it also can introduce distortions in to the allocation of seats are for example there in a province if\nIt's insecure in one area and relatively secure in another area than if the people only vote in one part of the province only their representatives are going to get elected to parliament and not going to give a sense of disenfranchisement what's\nLife like for Africans living in the Taliban controlled territory\nIn many places I think people have concluded that if you keep your head down don't challenge the Taliban have no dealings with the government you will be okay\nBut the chances of getting on in life the chance of doing the kinds of things that well people in poorer places off to do try to get a job in the city working with the government those options are all cut off\nAnd is a Taliban controlled area a Taliban Renee area by which I mean all their services can you live a life get a job feed your children\nWell certainly the Taliban have a rudimentary administration but it's not like a normal government they have an administrator that they put in some in charge of a each district there are four hundred\nIn the country how they basically trying to preside over law and order and a lot of districts in Afghanistan\nThe way it works is that the administrative headquarters and a circle with a radius of about maybe half a kilometer around it is controlled by the government and that's where the government administrator sits and there's a security posts a small contingent of Afghan police\nAnd then the villages are controlled by the Taliban so by not reckoning I think we can say that over half the national Tara tree is currently one way or another in Taliban hands\nMichael Semple all NATO has more than fourteen thousand troops in Afghanistan they're not involved in combat operations [noise] so what are they doing I spoke to kind of ... pets is he's German and he speaks on behalf of the nature resolute support mission in Afghanistan\nOr support mission of NATO is a non combat mission so we are not deploying troops\nAnyway this concrete NATO will not have a role on Saturday the whole security at the hands of police and they ask an army the African national defense and security forces\nThe Taliban are beginning to say at least some who and negotiating in different ways with western diplomats that\nThey would tolerate some kind of a NATO presence can you foresee the Taliban having some involvement in government and they're still being western troops there\nIf I could see that took his theorists will be Fabio my pay grade and let you know NATO is not involved in this negotiation\nBut I'm guessing that you might have worked in other parts of the world where former enemies become political or I suppose pot and that was to try and bring conflict to an end and\nI are your right to different parts of the whole before but I don't dare to speculate here in Afghanistan Afghanistan\nIs a very special place wall tone for more than\nForty years already the crossroads that we are at right now\nRequires let's ... at first to take a serious decision which way they should go all day going forward towards a political settlement or will they stay on the path of\nViolence and committing horrible acts against the civilian population over here\nNATO spokesman kind of pets

California's forty eighth congressional district as a close race here that might help determine whether Republicans hang on to the house or whether Democrats take control\nWe visited three corners of the seaside district in one was Huntington Beach a place that many call surf city usa\nNow California might be known for the anti Trump resistance will you might say Huntington Beach is part of the resistance to that resistance it's a conservative city that won a lawsuit against the state government over its so called sanctuary long\nCalifornia lawmakers don't want local police departments cooperating with federal immigration authorities to target people here illegally Huntington Beach argued we can cooperate with them if we want to a city council meeting about this issue lasted six hours and\nDrew more than a hundred speakers there were people there were signs that said things like we heart President Trump and also build walls to Fort\nOver passion you can understand where it comes from if you talk to a voter like Donna killer\nWell I'm I'm a woman single ... single so my first thing is safety Seville legal immigration is always on my mind you don't know who's coming here find you will never see in LA or you know certain cities after dark because it's just I don't feel safe\nDone a killer is the daughter of an immigrant herself her mom moved to the U.S from Japan I was chatting with done it this week at her home which also serves as a workspace for her ceramics business\nYou don't see a lot of people that can do these on ceramic pieces the beautiful yeah well\nI had a helper named Pablo\nAnd he was amazing and he was deported\nAnd she should be here\nTo what what do you think of President Trump in general and his approach to immigration\nBecause I think he has to be that way\nBut what if someone who is concerned about immigrants' rights so to you how can you have it both ways how can you both support someone like Pablo and your other friends who are in the country illegally\nAnd also support President Trump who is so\nTough on people who are in the country illegally like how can you\nHow kind of what happened I put those two together are I don't see chance like that\nI don't think he I don't think they're mutually exclusive\nI think you could want to have good laws to protect us 'cause that's the main job of the federal government is to protect us need borders and I also think that there's room to have these people that want to come here and have a better life that they should be able to stay here\nYou know I think there should be a way\nWe should say you know Mr ... you need to let you know Pablo stay here he's a law abiding citizen and get the little the sleazy ones that are you know doing the trafficking and the ... that's that's what we have to focus on not the people that just want to\nBring something to the table here\nWhat role with this with this election play\nWell I think it'll put more people in Congress and the Senate hopefully and it'll be able to push through\nTrump's agenda and I think 'cause the left from what I'm hearing if they get powered all they're going to do with investigations and impeach\nDots that does it when my heart\nAnd I think if they win that's what they're going to do and I don't think that's a good thing\nNow done a killer told me not everyone has reacted so well to her support of the president\nOh yeah I have people in my face with the Comey races and all this other stuff and I'm like really your friends with the race it slightly ... on friending me if you think I'm a racist why do they call you\nThen because I support trans\nAnd this is so sibling becoming is is it hurt\nIt's surprising to me that they would say that to me 'cause I'm like the nicest person in the world like I Would do anything for anybody I waited and are these friends like people view\nAnd it's like I call it that trying to arrangements syndrome I Know you've heard of it but it's still like different people when you bring up front that second flip the switch for them\nNow about three miles away and another Huntington Beach home we spoke with Shane and ...\nThem to the cabinet quarters at all campaigned you've ... precinct now right back here\nShe is a middle school teacher who's running for city council and we seem to have nothing at all in common with on a killer and again these are two women whose politics are motivated by the same emotion fear ... said she remembers feeling it at her middle school the morning after Trump was elected\nOn that day when I Know that so many people are just devastated and in shock and calling back into the covers I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified\nBut what was giving them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported and\nSome of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn what way when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like cells and body systems\nAnd I had several students who we've been trying to get their parents to come in for ... or to discuss their child's individualized education plan that won't come because they're afraid of getting picked up\nAnd the students have shared with me and my mom doesn't have papers so we don't leave\nThey can't they're afraid to come to school\nSheena late this is a Democrat and that's the way she's going to be voting next month for Harley router over Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher but she says what she wants most is lawmakers who are willing to work with the other side\nI have to believe that there are people on both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together that this divisive mass I really\nWant to believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou are labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nSet is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet\nBut if you're out there in the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together then divide science\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to settle people down here we are just calling the president racist and say\nThat's that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that absolutely\nI don't know that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist but I think I could say something along the lines of continuing to\nPush that narrative is not helpful\nWhat is something that we can talk about that it's helpful\nThat was the voice of Shane up late this and before that we heard from Donna Keller there

NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep here are two basic realities about California first it's an overwhelmingly democratic state which Hillary Clinton won with millions of votes despair\nIt is also home to a number of Republican members of Congress they have represented the state's red or areas for many years now and today I Am in one of several districts where Democrats are mounting challenges as they try to retake the house Republican Dana Rohrabacher\nHas served the forty eighth district for just about three decades now most recently he made some news for his open embrace of Russia the Democratic challenger here hardly ruder has a real chance\nAnd David I Know you've been talking with voters who will be helping to make that decision here in a few weeks what anything has changed in that district\nWell I mean this is a district Orange County that has always been pretty conservative and and it's still so in many ways but you know it's it's been getting more\nModerate and I've been speaking to people that are wealthy people here who voted Republican in the path to try and keep their taxes low but now have turned against President Trump there's a huge Vietnamese community here Steve and the younger generation that community is I think more left leaning than their parents but\nI Want to introduce you to to voters are in surf city usa that's Huntington Beach um this is a conservative city\nIn this district where a lot of residents won the police um to cooperate with federal immigration authorities that's very important to them of one of them is ... she runs the ceramics business she supports President Trump's immigration policies because she ... she told me she worries about her safety\nWell I'm I'm a ... single ... single so my first thing that safety said the legal immigration is always on the line you don't know who's coming here if you will never seen you in LA or you know certain cities after dark because it's just I don't feel safe\nI guess we should underline David the conservative media and President Trump commonly highlight crimes linked to people who've come to the U.S illegally but statistically there doesn't seem to be any evidence that people who come here illegally commit crimes at any higher rate than anybody else\nYeah and I think it's really important to point that out um but you know she regardless of that is motivated by fear um and in a way I think you could say the same thing about a Democrat named shame that\nLife is she's in middle school teacher I met here um she fears for her students wellbeing right now many of them she said wonder if and when their fathers might be deported and because of that these students are having trouble focusing in class\nAnd I had several student here we've been trying to get their parents to come in for ... or ... their child's individualized education plan that won't come because they're afraid of getting picked up and the students have shared with me and my mom doesn't have papers so we don't reach they can't they're afraid to come to school\nAnd so Steve you know that these are the kinds of voices you hear in a competitive congressional district um and I was just taken by\nThese two women you know we talk so much about division they're going to vote for different candidates here they're going to vote for different visions next month but there is this shared emotion it's fear things id that's driving both of them and those are emotions I think we see a lot of the country\nIt's reminding me of the voters we spoke with a one week ago in Kentucky and a different congressional district David because in those conversations people\nHad a lot to say they were deeply upset and at the same time seemed really conscious that whatever they said was going to make one of their neighbors are many other neighbors mad that you get that sense in California I'm a little bit yeah but but\nYou know I also got the sense and and and you probably heard some of this as well but there are a lot of voters who feel the country is so very divided right now and they do feel\nThis shared sense of unease and they want even if there are political divisions to be able to talk to one another again and we heard a lot of people who want to elect people to Congress who are also willing to talk to one another\nOK David thanks for the reporting really appreciate it yeah and we'll go on her\nThe race for Congress that decision belongs to millions of ...\nThere is like some of the people that David Was just speaking with hundreds of candidates are on the ballot but much of the attention day to day goes to one single person\nAnd that's where I met one person is President Trump who held the latest of his campaign rallies last night he was in Montana firing up the crowd with a joke about violence against a journalist\nBut I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise] the the there is the man Trump was stumping for Thursday night GOP house candidate Greg June fourteenth last year he assaulted a reporter he was a candidate at the time who went on to win a special election the following day\nAnd I said oh this is terrible he said it was the elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help him [noise]\nDo you think we should say pleaded guilty and was convicted of misdemeanor assault\nThat is only one of the ways that journalists are in news stories this morning with the president of the United states as well here with NPR's Scott Horsley Scott good morning Steve any surprised at all of the president would take a verbal shot so to speak at the media\nYou know uh you know attacking the news media has been a staple a fixture of Trump rallies for a long time now reporters have been a convenient foil for this president even though Donald Trump ... much of a success to the saturation news coverage he gets from the media\nUh he acknowledged early on in the mystery over the disappearance of ... that it was a little bit out of character for him to be expressing concern about the state of a journalist but you know we've had violent attacks on journalists in this country and that is not stop the president from using\nTough language to describe the news media and I don't guess this will either\nWell ... that would be another way that the president is in the news with a member of the news media because the president himself\nHas drawn his administration have ever closer to Saudi Arabia and of course Saudi Arabia is a close ally of the United states of any us administration really\nBut the president faces questions about the Saudi role in the disappearance and reporting killing of democracy oh gee the dissident journalist who had left to Saudi Arabia was in Turkey went into a steady constantly\nNever a is known to have come out how is the president's response evolved if at all over the last several days\nI think he is feeling some pressure to respond if only a ... as treating this as kind of a public relations problem he told the New York times yesterday\nThis one has caught the imagination of the world unfortunately now he does seem to recognize that the allegations of this grisly murder at the hands of Saturday operatives has galvanized criticism of the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a way that maybe earlier episodes of the war in Yemen or the mass execution of dissidents has not\nAnd the president has big gun to acknowledge that he and his administration may have to respond to that however reluctantly we saw the first response yesterday with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin announcing that he would pull out of a big investment conference the so called Davos in the desert next week in Riyadh\nHe took that step sort of belatedly a lot of business in journalistic leaders had already pulled out of that conference and it was only announced with a tweet that wasn't a lot of fanfare at the same time you had secretary of state Mike Pompeo just back from visiting Saudi Arabia and turkey are\nAsking for patients and saying you know we ought to give the Saudis a few more days to complete their investigation Scott Saudi Arabia\nIs you know is not terribly popular in the United states and here's the president defending a defendant gets leaders did this feel at all like voting issue in this election season\nIt's not something he's been talking about ... campaign rallies and that's where the president is spending a lot of his time these days he is feeling some pressure from fellow Republicans here in Washington but this doesn't seem like something that's necessarily going to move the needle with the voting public Scott Horsley thanks very much You're welcome\n[noise]\nOne more election now Saturday was supposed to be election day in Kandahar Province Afghanistan but now those elections are postpone for a week\nYou know this is after campaign related violence that has left ten candidates in many more supporters did in one case a bomb was planted under a candidates sofa and then yesterday Afghanistan's national police chief was assassinated\nTaliban insurgents who want to disrupt the election have claimed responsibility but rival politicians are also suspected to be behind some of this violence let's turn now to\nPamela constable who has covered Afghanistan for years and she's on the line welcome back\nWith you I Want to understand where these elections stand some of them have been postponed is that right\n[noise] yeah at this point they felt it held in most of the country although it cars can crack\nAnd number ... already going to be close so it's not a nation wide election already but they're closing a delaying the polling at all throughout the ... are we in our province\nLaying off by one wake up at the right way to get to that for the number of a fight that that could well not if they find out what\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... heads people and that might well have murdered ... in the ... ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some ... column is to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those protections to raise money from one of the worst regimes on our that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley\nAnd I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar megacities the Saudis are creating called Neal\nAnd Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people in other corporate people\nOn the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain\nThat America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and that things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep in the bowels

California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC President Trump has acknowledged what increasingly seems like reality or a ... a reporter asked him do you believe a Saudi journalist us residential market showed you used that\nSurvivor show these dead [noise]\nAh it certainly looks that way they are very very sad certainly look this\nMarks one of the few occasions on which the president has endorsed the broadly accepted outlines of the case ever since the Washington Post writer walked into a shouting consulate and vanished in Turkey suspicion is falling on the Saudi Government get the president has suggested conspiracy theories about what could be responsible for a gruesome murder\nAnd said Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was being held guilty\nUntil proven innocent what does the U.S approach really mean for the Saudis and for Americans\nAnd for freedom of the press will talk that through with Victoria Nuland of the center for new American security she's on the line she was assistant secretary of state under President Obama ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush to morning\nGood morning Steve good to be with you know watching\nFrom the outside what does President Trump's goal appear to be\nWell I think it's important that President Trump seems to have the knowledge reality as you said in your opening that this was a grisly murder of a journalistic criticized critic of the Saudi regime\nAnd that they're gonna have to be consequences for this kind of extra territorial illegal at\nBoth the president also said unfortunately this has captured the attention of the world that's a quote from yesterday making it clear it seems that if this isn't really something he wants to be dealing with he would rather be making friends with the Saudis\nYeah it's highly inconvenient for the president's policy toward Saudi Arabia but I think what's interesting here is this has been going on for almost two weeks now as you know Steve and\nIt is really captured the concern of the American people not just members of Congress but all across the country people are watching this case and Americans don't want to be on the side of grizzly killers they want their country to stand for rule of law and the president's having to grapple with that now\nWith any us administration\nHave to do something like this maybe they'd be less clumsy and maybe they'd be less overt about it but the Saudis are an ally and they do things that Americans strongly disapprove of and even the administration's you were part of found ways to look the other way to ...\nYou know it's always been a complex relationship with the Saudis as you say they play a large role in the region we often collaborate on things but we've also\nHad very severe problems in the past and we've had to deal with them and there are lots of points of leverage in the relationship that we can and should be using it is an a a real extra bridge when you have a regime a murdering its credit in another country\nExtra leverage okay so what is practical what could the Trump Administration do without harming U.S interests given that the U.S leans on the Saudis for certain things\nWell it's a very good step that secretary ... has decided not to go to the big investment conference that\nThe king and the crown prince are holding next week and that is also encouraged lots of us business to stay away the kingdom is trying to present itself as a real forming opening democratizing country where people should put their money\nUm but they can't have that reputation and also the killing their ... their critics so it's a very good sign that we are denying them\nUh that big party a there are also questions on the hill and elsewhere whether we should be selling the kinds of\nLethal weapons that were selling to the Saudi regime or when they behave this way internationally including the violence that they are responsible for in Yemen so I think there'll be a whole ... look at the Saturday relationship that said we need to collaborate in Syria\nOr we need to collaborate in terms of keeping the sea lanes open in the Gulf and other things so it's a complex relationship but we need to be quite serious about saying no to this kind of international violence\nPeople are also asking questions of course about the influence of Saudi money or the United states where you're elsewhere in the program today about Saudi investments in Silicon valley which seem to continue even if some Silicon Valley executives are not going to be going to this big event that you described there Saturday funding to think tanks in Washington\nDid did you guys at the center for new American security have you had a debate about whether to take Saudi money at any point\nA we have a strong decision that we only take support from treaty allies say the United states are our European partners we do not take any money from the Gulf or from other countries with a gay the human rights record so\nSo that's a that's a hard nose should other should other organizations in the United states follow a policy like that do you think\nI think also tanks have to look hard at who is supporting them whether they're private individuals or whether they're foreign governments are a lot of think tanks take money from the Chinese government and a meter what they say that China as a result um I think that Tom ... under cuts the legitimacy of you are independent research\nWhat about Saudi business investments should American companies think twice about those billions and billions of dollars that have to go somewhere\nYou know on the business side it's a matter of commercial interests both ways and then I Do think people have to think hard about the money that they can and the strings that come with it and moral and uh otherwise\nVictoria Nuland thanks so much really appreciate it thank you Steve she's a former top State Department diplomatic chief executive officer of the center for new American security\n\nMore and more businesses are being rated as the Trump Administration goes after employers who knowingly hire unauthorized immigrants the biggest busts Deval targeted a trailer manufacturers in northeast Texas immigration police hauled off more than a hundred and fifty workers from the

overhead and three hundred ice agents swarmed into his yard\nIt looked like something that you typically would see out of the movie is not something you ever plan on living out in real life\nIce

agents have stormed seven Elevens a meat packing plant dairy and vegetable farms and feed lot Katrina burger cheap homeland security investigator in the Dallas office read a statement to reporters after the low trail rave\nIn recent years the Saudis sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks\nIn Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund forty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund was the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun\nSo Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others\nAre a lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saudi investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom\nThat runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with the un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... heads people and that might well have murdered ... in the ... ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others\nHe got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some ... column is to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op [noise] what do you have any evidence that wins Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those protections to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley\nAnd I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar megacities the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people in other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley make a lot of a very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain\nThat America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and that things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep in the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wield and the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic Lee blind to\n[noise] on a
