Sondra how would you be able to prove that evidence\nWell this is related to the department of justice complaint that came out in September\nAnd because we are named in that complaint as the great that date a lot of the malware reverse engineering we were able to take the work that we did there couple it with the responses that we've done and we're able to narrow down a tight cluster of activity that we're seeing all over\nThe world another way that they get access to these networks used by going into the dark Web\nOn the White House spokesman Raj Shah says that's enough for the nomination should be confirmed\nThe fact is that these allegations have not\nBeen ...\n... not in a new FBI investigation\nNot anywhere\nAnd that's no Russia of course that's Mitch McConnell a leading Republican\n... we can do to Celeste Headley whose the rights of journalists and radio presenter in the U.S and no so senators from her spokespeople a thanks for being with us I wasn't necessarily ask you to guess how this is going to go I think we can\nSort of assume that it's likely to go ahead I I wanted in the time that we have available really to ask you how this has affected attitudes\nTo women the me too movement\n[noise] well I mean there's a lot of anger on the part of women who are already part of the me too movement interestingly enough Dan I'm a recent polls have shown that it's actually motivated conservative voters more than it has voters on the left\nAnd that means then the when the November elections come which is just to less than a month away now yeah I might not affect voting\nIt it's a really good question I mean already ... it looks like the young voters are not likely to\nGet out in numbers we have some polls recently that show people over sixty five or eighty two percent of them are likely to vote whereas somewhere around in the low twenties percentage of young people are probably going to vote and that's like within the past few days\nSo I'm not sure that we might see the huge bump that many people are are expecting\nUm it may turn out as it has in the past where it's mostly senior citizens who knows um but at its early days or it showed that conservative voters might be gaining in what they call in and do as the as an edge for voting\nAnd the Kavanaugh hearing that's affected that and in a way that perhaps the Democrats hadn't expected\n[noise] yeah and and we want to be clear that that doesn't necessarily mean that what I just said\nIt is what's going to be reflected on and on voting day November right I mean these are always about who's likely to vote 'em and and the sample size and so who knows especially if the vote goes ahead and Kavanaugh's confirmed we don't really know that how that's going to affect people and and how angry\nMany women may become I mean we do know that there is there's a wide uh dissatisfaction with the Republican Party among women and\nThere has been some who've said that the Republicans may have lost women for a generation we'll see if that's true\nSo let's thank you Celeste Headley coming up before us in the United states thanks very much you're listening to weld update\nRussian hackers and intelligent agents have targeted international anti doping organizations chemical weapons bonuses and the ... Olympic athletes such according to a detailed indictment from the U.S Justice Department\nAnd the Dutch government yesterday reveal details of a failed attempt by Russian agents to undermine the OPEC W the chemical weapons agency\nBased in the hay wanted was investigating the use of nova joke in the English city of ... so with that in mind what kind of relationship between the U.S between the west and the Russians\nWhat kind of a relationship is that now is a new Cold War\nI've been speaking to an apple ... who's a historian and commentator and the British member of parliament bumps ... who was a journalist in the Soviet Union when it existed I began by asking and she react well badly to the phrase new Cold War\nI actually dislike the phrase because that leads people to roll their eyes and say oh no not that again we've that's over I Do think it's correct to say that we are living in a time when we are facing once again an ideological challenge to the idea of the west and the challenge is coming in part from Russia which\nCertainly sees itself\nAs at war with us in the very broad sense Russian public is fed with the daily diet of\nAnger and hatred about the west in western institutions the Russian government invests in anti western anti EU anti NATO political parties all over Europe they see themselves as in an ideological struggle so in that sense I think the phrase is although unfortunate is correct\nAbove CD you were in the Soviet Union now you are a part of Britain's political C ... is Cold War and accurate for\nIt is and it's because it's not anything like that the Russians coach pharmacist in East Germany much weaker but it is in the dictionary definition of total means which is a core values and interests played a season information on it\nAnd they may not have troops in eastern Germany but they have a large number of troops just over the border from a studio for example and they carry out loud scale maneuvers along the border of the European Union and NATO could tone hot\nObviously I don't know the answer to that it's certainly true that Russia is using its military exercises almost as a weapon in the information war So Russia has carried out very very aggressive\nExercises up to and including practicing the use of nuclear weapons\nThe point of doing that is to intimidate countries on its borders to show this kind of aggression therefore to weaken support for NATO and some of those countries\nI think what Russia would really like to do is when the war when the ideological ... without fighting but I don't think we can exclude the possibility that Sunday they will use weapons the Russian Army famous but it does with an exercise as\nBob Said he will not ideological contest that marked the fifties sixties and seventies between the Soviet Union and the west what could be done what should the government's likely UK Government will the u._s. do in order to calm things down\nTo start because although this is Richard ... doctor knows communism versus liberal society it is a form of Russian ... some of the great threat to mankind structured so see is how we in the worst offenders from the free societies from those\nFor the sophisticated all ... states developing means of state control which is not a conventional shoulder people but also took ... sauce with China or Russia or whether it's the positive future\nMaybe I was wrong maybe it is the idea of logical of those people who want to be presidents for life you know authoritarian regimes versus those who don't\nDepends what you mean by ideological that I mean I think certainly we are in a war of values or war is the wrong expression there is a struggle for values which values are going to dominate Europe over the next uh in the coming decades there are now parties who are part of the ruling coalition in Italy as there are for example in Austria\nWho also have very close links to Russia and who admire an advocate the Russian model of of politics corrupt crony capitalism authoritarian rule one man rule one party rule there is certainly a struggle of ideas\nAnd Bob CD can then the west can NATO can Britain afford this contest because it seems that robust armament might be the way to resist\nThem is one way or don't necessarily the structure is the most important of which are sort of district setting democratic gets ... ships we can housing for registrations per country that if you represent\nShould always ... or any of ... state you know you have to be up to it\nSo this is sort of become more difficult for me to give her was fine TV stations deliberately lie extra security ministry done well there's a lot to see if there's more that we should not be the most important thing to do\nAs we did in the end of the Cold War is a multi agency group for us to go to expose explosion by the states that's\nObscene a member of the British parliament's in the conservatives the ruling party and an apple bombed the historian we can talk to ... in Moscow now I'll ask you about these allegations and reaction in a moment Sarah but since we're talking about the Cold War what does that phrase ever end to the media in Russia\n[noise] it does yeah it's a sort of bonded around in the same way here as it is I guess in a in Western Europe and and ...\nUm but I mean I guess I'd say that that is being twenty five years if I open society here and have my sometimes it seems that we're going back to the past I'd\nSay on a human level things have changed so much hair that it's hard to think of as going backwards again I mean you know we took it off about the penetration of state media here and how that influences people's opinions and it certainly does but\nI look at what's happening recently with all the uh digging investigation that's being done by let's say in Moscow Russian gymnast primarily digging up on the Internet information about people who was supposed to be secrets agents you know things have changed people's mindset has changed\nAnd there are tempted to reverse the the clocks and and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different difficult ... back\nWhat then has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons agency the obesity W\nWell that is an old school reaction not set fuel dismissal in denial from Russia I mean the the uh the ... that's been coming from the west I think as\nSlightly uh surprised most go up but it's replied ended in its usual way in a way that we've seen ever since I guess getting back to climate annexation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine and then I might Seventeen and that they stay in schools and all the rest of it is all about saying\nAnd obviously from now I don't I don't think many people would consider normal Trump to be one of the world's great Penman and yet you well two to one of his\nWealth this book is you know written in history lessons that changed Well Donald Trump was on ... change the world of one of the fascinating thing it's just that when he was ... with Kim Jong ...

Christine Blasey Ford who says that she was sexually assaulted by him decades ago and in Rochester, Minnesota yesterday President Trump cast the Supreme Court voted purely partisan terms\nDemocrats had been trying\nTo destroy judge Brett Kavanaugh says [noise]\nThe\nVery first second he was announced and it was announced for one simple reason he is an incredible intellect\nKevin himself said that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominees vaguely backed off of that a surgeon saying that he said some things he shouldn't have and his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning you thank you for having me so\nLet's notes that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including Dr by the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been to leave it should've been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white water has\nLet let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride the uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nInterview conducted by the FBI leads to an additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR\nLeads after they hear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly described as to who they could interview and how long they had and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate for\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hand of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in this interview although it's not in court in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eye witness than other\nLeads that should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way a Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicts and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject\nInterpretation or you alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that out to buy here too important point first of all this report should be made public so you and I\nCan't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention them making can afford it by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of can from it has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday disqualify self painting

today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault\nIn an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment but Kavanaugh nomination\nHas led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... type believe survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the\nTime glad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece\nAm a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silenced women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community my concern is that\nThis hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of\n... investigation or life altering effects happened we simply can't believe one party over another uh\nJust on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo ... what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also add but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like\nWhat how do you how do you handle that\nWell as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me and\nThey're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of\nIssues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings when someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yep what these women said is right I did it uh\nOften times we don't uh\nI think we can draw some\nConcerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in

seen happen on college campuses these days but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support\nAdvocacy help and the people charged with doing that should believe you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened\nThat same point of view the accuser is telling the truth and we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh\nAdjudication I'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems are based on a\nA pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still\nEncouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nReluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process and there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were a\nDistressed by the uh\nExtreme anger and aggressiveness a and partisan attacks Brett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men who've been through this process on campus\nTheir lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared\nA say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack\nAnd lawyers I've spoken to said if their

taxpayers will be taking more of their pay starting this month to boost the economy their marketplaces China correspondent Jennifer peck joined us from Shanghai Hi there Hi alright so specifically what's changed with China's individual income\nJak well starting this month people earning less than eighty seven hundred dollars a year will not have to pay income tax that's increase from the previous threshold of six thousand dollars a year\nOr so left out to the tax people more for the consumer are they going to slash out and spend a lot of money with all this extra disposable income\nAnd not exactly the simple reason is the cost of living is going up particularly in housing we reached at taxpayer named young men who is in the eastern Chinese city of ... he's working as a project manager at an auto parts factory now with this tax change he says he'll be able to keep an extra fifty eight dollars a month\nBut are now a gun to put on the drugs so\nHe says an extra fifty eight dollars could buy a pair of shoes or two pairs of hands and she says the tax changes it it's a nice idea but it's not really going to help him get what he wants most which is to put a down payment on a property\nAlright so changing the taxes is a way to boost consumer spending other strategies that the Chinese government does a pursuing\nWell the government is also promising new individual tax deductions in January but analysts argue that this increase is still far too modest to boost consumer spending\nIn January China is changing the way it collects Social Security contributions this is important because an estimated two thirds of companies and employees are not paying the full contributions so remember our taxpayer young that he will be taking home an extra fifty eight dollars a month right\nBut after January with the added Social Security contributions he'll have only an extra Fifteen dollars to take home a month that is if he still has a job because some factories we spoke and two I have talked about downsizing because of this change\nSo given all of these challenges coming up you can see why cutting the tax threshold days leading some Chinese

one\nSimple reason he is an incredible intellect\nKevin himself said that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominee vaguely backed off of that is or shouldn't saying that he said some things he shouldn't have and his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning you thank you for having me so\nLet's note that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including Dr by the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued leads that should've been followed answers that should've been sawed and it has all the appearance of a white was\nHandled let let me just ask you about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride or who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally every interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR\nPursue leads after they hear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that the FBI with certain scribe as to who they could interview and how long they had and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is that contention that there is no end of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in the interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez\nAnd the specific eyewitnesses and other leads it should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way at Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nAllow them huge contradiction and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there's solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here are two important point first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention now making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualifying the self painting arrogant\nAcrimonious threatening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways

countries and yet there are some key health officials who remain optimistic that it won't actually come to that and ... and has more\nIt was always clear this outbreak was going to be extra

safe burial teams sometimes causing serious injuries and mistrust has helped drive a third worrisome development multiple people who are infected in the epicenter than opted to fleet to locations

I think three or four hours going over these ... reports\nUm she ... you know I Know Susan Collins and she does not look like the normal ... and ... you really looks at frayed is the right word\nYou are reminding us of the stakes here this may even be a bigger vote in the very close health care vote where John McCain in the late John McCain last year famously walked in and did thumbs down\nThis is this is a good deal bigger let's go now to the Senate floor Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee is now giving one of the earliest speeches here on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh let's\nGive us a dozen times judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar in his community and also on the legal profession he serves underprivileged communities cultures girls' basketball and his elect our\nAt his church has shown a deep commitment to preparing young lawyers for their careers here's been a law professor\nAt St prestigious law schools\nAnd a mentor dozens of judicial law clerks this should have been a respectable and dignified confirmation process in a previous era\nIs highly qualified nominee would have received unanimous support in the Senate\nBefore or left wing outside groups and democratic leaders had him in their sights\nPossessed an impeccable reputation\nAnd was held in high esteem by the bench\nAnd the bar alive\nEven the American bar association which Democrats say is there a gold standard for judging judges\nThe NBA gave him their unanimous well qualified rating what left wing groups and their democratic allies have done to judge Kavanaugh\nIsn't nothing short\nI saw what they did to Robert Bork\nI saw what they did to Clarence Thomas\nThat was nothing\nCompared to what we witness here in the last three months\nThe conduct of left wing dark money groups and their allies in this body\nHave shamed us all\nThe fix was in from the very beginning before the game was even dry on the nomination the minority leader announced that he would oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nWith everything he's got\nEven before he knew the president's nominee minority leader said that he was opposed to all twenty five well qualified potential\nNominee listed by this president\nEven one member of my committee said that those who vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh would be called uncle complicit\nAnother member of the committee revealed the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats could hold the vacancy open\nFor two years if they defeated judge Kavanaugh and took control of the Senate in these midterm elections\nI saw the most transparent\nI oversaw the most transparent confirmation process in Senate history based on the fact that more than five hundred thousand pages of judicial writings publications documents from judge Kavanaugh's executive branch service\nThis is on top of the three hundred and seven judicial opinions that he offered despite Democrats efforts to bury the committee and even more paperwork\nThe Senate Judiciary committee held a timely for day hearing\nOn judge Kavanaugh's nomination last month\nJudge Kavanaugh testified for more than thirty two hours over the course of three days judge Kavanaugh showed the nation exactly why he deserved to be on the Supreme Court because of these qualifications judge Kavanaugh's antagonize is\nCouldn't land to punch on him\nDuring those history days of testimony\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa reviewing some of the recent history very painful and very well known to many Americans at this point\nAs we prepare for a vote on cloture ending debate\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and I want to go briefly to Kelsey Snell NPR's Kelsey Snell because she is at the United States Senate today and Kelsey ought to back away from Chuck Grassley voice for a moment can you just paint a picture of us who's in there is there is there a big crowd of senators which is not always the case\nActually on the floor for these speeches\nNot yet we're not at that part of the day yet I'm this is kind of a quieter moment defending his chest open and honest and you really only have one or two senators and a bunch of staff and the ... and a little ... pages that the high school students who I spend about a semester here in the capital helping the senators out\nWe expect that people will start filtering in and giving speeches and I will also seen many speeches that are part of this debate that comes after the culture about this ... this necessary procedural vote because some senators are saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final content\nOkay this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now wants his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone so there is a possibility that people\nCould change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people including and you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day I knew exactly what will happen on that final which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene his co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder if you could\nTalk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades at applications ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I had seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints in the title isn't that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills a passing a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting just the basics the government can't question is if they can continue to do that or if they fight flowers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleagues Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington hey there Scott David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I I think Diane Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't quite there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from Fort key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides in both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago so I remember", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition
