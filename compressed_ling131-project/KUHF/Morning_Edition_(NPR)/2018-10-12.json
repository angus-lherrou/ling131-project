[noise]\n\nThis is Dan Damon with wild update there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of\nYou know the use of the twentieth century will the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind immune from the University of cans of brand new Zealand to most of the connection between herbicides on to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for palm that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense or vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway told the parks loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where they're stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they may touched their mouth\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the cat is on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that ask these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nAnd also to ... he he's a correspondent for the independent newspaper covering the middle east from is Tim ... first of all of the story of ... what do we know so far\nWe do know that much according to the uh anonymous intelligence officials who spoke to the Washington Post they were able to access audio and video recordings that apparently\nRecord the moments before and during that Jamal ... violent death inside the consulate now Turks made these recordings they've not publicly talked about these recordings that have been some whispers of recordings but\nThe word in the Washington Post story and in intelligence circles is that the Turks don't want to\nAdmit that they have these tapes because they you know it's just bad practice to let every consulate in Istanbul and al ... embassy in Ankara\nKnow that their officers are parked which they should probably assume anyway uh we also just heard that a delegation of Saudi officials to arrive in Ankara very soon en route to a stumble to take part with and possibly cooperate with the investigation\nProfessor John ... we know that Mohammed bin Salman is in a strong position but nothing in vulnerable ones so the theory that's running is that\nHe has to do something really tough against those who might undermine his power do you accept the that is a reasonable the or even if it don't have the facts\nTheories can be a reasonable but in this instance would not be jumping ... present in any kind of play to Saudi Arabia they are much bigger fish up there and a man was a process only individual\nYou have differences of opinion we senior soluble visuals but\nNothing to do the extent that it would require such brutality and violence as the alleged right now on

know what to say that you know you're not how shall we say that I knew I interviewed before I I think I pretty much disagree with every single thing that\nThe previous person said the Turks have\nReleased a lot of evidence already they're releasing it in dribs and drabs most likely for diplomatic reasons because they're trying to get some concessions out of Saudi Arabia to try to see what they can pull a in a sort of Machiavelli in way out of this I think that\nMPs wind and he is very reckless young man has done\nUnbelievable things in the past before that included\nKidnapping the prime minister of Lebanon and putting ... much of the Saudi royal family under house arrest in prison is not beyond the realm of possibility that in a state of anger at something democracy hokey sad or wrote a heat may have ordered this operation\nProfessor 'cause you see on ... what would be the pointing it being a stunt\nIs not a question of the sun or noticed them I Am not the position to know exactly what happened and neither is your previous speaker now that's let's put that aside for the center the Turkish government in the name of the president has stated that they have done is\nThe time has come to the evidence or shut up it's as simple as that actions issues against while I'm an ...\nFor being whether he is not going to get us anywhere and will not know whether it's from a

like that turkey is not a place where it's not easy to be a journalist and he's not a Turkish journalist ... so ... what do you think the outcome of this might be in the regional politics\nI think that right now as I was mentioning earlier the Turkish and Saudi officials are meeting there is a very good chance that turkey is going to ask for a price for sweeping this under the rug as the Saudis have suggested to the uh the Trump Administration they would like to do\nI think that price is going to be very high it might be something like restore good relations with Qatar which is a an ally of turkey and locked in a bitter rivalry with Saudi Arabia it might be having something to do with the economy will have to sit in the next few hours\nAnd professor because just young what does it do to relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia looking especially at what's going on in Syria\nWhere it's going to get even more complicated than it was in the past and I think that the first will not be sort of\nBuy a taxi or ... or ... or any other individual and I realize this is a very sensitive my friend that a lot of people have stayed in what's going on but\nTo see that the murder of a human being is something that could be pushed under the water is totally can be even far from a U.S all he was assassinated the dismembered body ... whereas the ... I think you'd see come on to come\n[noise] that's professor Joseph 'cause Jon he is from the king Faisal Center for research and Islamic studies in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and we had also from a ... ... who is a respond a correspondent for the independent newspaper based in a stone boat [noise]\nA correspondent in Seoul South Korea Laura because it has been interviewing the south Korean president Moon Jae in who's won't there might be more diplomatic bumps and bruises that's the phrase on the way\nThings are looking good eventually he says that will be an agreement to declare a formal and the Korean War between the United states and North Korea\nOr from ... ...\nThat's for the end of war declaration I had ample discussions with President Trump as well as other U.S officials on this issue and if North Korea takes us measures than the end of or declaration it'd be a political statement would announce the longstanding hostile relations between Tim Young and Washington have ended\nSo we would need to have this declaration at the earliest possible date and I believe there was a shared understanding between Washington and so the guarding the viewpoint so I Believe it's on the amount of time and I'm not sure of dates and we will be able to sign this\nWith Laura joins us now Laura this is the dream that Moon Jae in and the people around who have been holding for well decades or how realistic is what he's saying\nWell I think when it comes to on paper and into four declaration I think that it's quite realistic he certainly seems to be an optimist and it appears that President Trump has disgusted with Kim Jong un at during the Singapore summit and but when it comes to the well the U.S is prepared to give\n... to the Trump Administration is reticence then it comes to hunting of an inch of war declaration\nVarious reasons for that that includes the fact that they have twenty eight thousand five hundred us troops based on their soil it may give North Korea and China the chance to turn around and go lick\nWhy do you need these trips if there is no longer the war on that peninsula why do you need to have a presence in the south China Sea why do you need to have ... you know military exercises\nAnd at least trips and not have bases for North Korea that base he has to teach ugly so one of the reasons why the U.S as reticent about handing over this end of war declaration is four at the with entire reasons they are worried that it's too big a concession\nBut both can be as have sat on signed declaration that they were wet towards this by the end of the year and it might well be that they can put something down on paper that the u._s. can cite that might be available might be secondly acceptable to all involved\nInterestingly he told you that perhaps the European leaders might be involved if things don't go well between Donald Trump and chairman Kim unless we do our in love at the moment\nYeah they fell in love and Singapore and when it comes to care at what's happening in ... and pregnant mean if traveling there tomorrow he'll be there for ten days and I think when it comes to what he's trying to do he tried to weight than\nThat they need to get on board with his ... it's a self centered approach says more carrot and stick approach coming from so then the rest of the Washington\nI think perhaps he's looking for allies he as the only man in the mental he's basically the mediator between the wells most unpredictable eat as they are the movement and love that last year they were and you know threatening to maintain fighting the safe perhaps looking for allies that he can lean on\nAnd say look come and help me mediate when it comes to Donald Trump and Kim giant\nLaura thank you Rebecca reporting from Seoul in South Korea the

a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included Audrey

this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University of more than guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nThere couldn't be any harder for me it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nEight hundred dollars is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had\nAny bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of television ad bars and restaurants\nAnd online as to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state in here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not\nRacist by any means and I bought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college is one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason we support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nI just I feel like [noise]\nI don't feel like a lot of people have made a few things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nI think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is ... it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south for the east and sell\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acute\nIs it is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here LCROSS we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrant is just becoming a more diverse state is that\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a part of which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by it\nTo me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis Frank that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict anthrax often that's been racialized right quite often it's addressed um toward immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um uh the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nIf you look at the exit polls and ... and they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was eight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent\nBlack population well let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east at April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in his congressional election\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are who are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat you each of you think about as you hear that voice\nI think about um the feelings we've heard across a number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic the at racial ... ideological\nMeaning that that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people LCROSS you get the last word here\nI think voters ... voters need to remember that the choices by Mary and binary choice is gradually move or a U.S through a continuum of history but each election as a binary choice and uh I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOK out process and Emily ... thanks

days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all end all and the standard bearer for

your friendship is someone your age would be against Trump\nBecause most people my age are um uh usually don't have political conversations with people my age just because they're so ready to pounce on anybody that doesn't think the same way as them I think that a lot of people my age they just say black and why they don't see growing\nOkay why would halls we favor Trump not because she's poor

this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nThat was actually a Trump voter was on my vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can or maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote trick it this is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state\nCapital included Audrey law\nDid those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would have oh heck yeah\nOh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University Good morning guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent and Amy McGrath a Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder phone is almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money we talking about here\nWell McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nEight million dollars is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had I known\nAny bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for the bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can't ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state in here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool\nOn I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not\nRacist by any means and I saw anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college\nOne of the only white girl on the team and we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason you support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nI don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things that aren't really hit you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nI think what's more important to recognize about this state is overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state than its neighbors to the south or the east and sell\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is it is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here Al Cross we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to immigrate immigrants this is becoming a more diverse state is that\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits Sosa Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a part of which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict anthrax often that's been racialized right quite often it addressed um towards immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state I'm a the a racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic branding Kentucky\nIf you look at the exit polls and ... and they have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was eight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote and yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent\nPopulation well let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in the historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market that she is help to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinion\nAnd yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in this congressional elections\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does\nFor so many people who are who are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat to each of you think about as you hear that voice\nI think I'm Out on the feelings we've heard across a number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic the it racial the ideological\nMeaning that that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people out cross you get the last word\nI think voters ... voters need to remember that the choices binary and binary choice is gradually move or a U.S through a continuum of history but each election as a binary choice and ah I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOK LCROSS and Emily ... thanks very much to both of you we're live at broom wagon bikes

their way we should really approach high frequency traders sick way\nBut I've been out on the street you're talking to people and you know the the metaphor I hear is that it's a little like an earthquake the earth shakes a bit and you wonder though is it a foreshock of the big one to come and you may be okay with what you lost this week but maybe it's time to take some money off the table is what some people have been suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end\nHave you taken money off the table on any of those prior uh events you would've left a ton of upside there and then you run into the real significant problem which is once you sell how do you get back in people are very very bad\nAt objectively evaluating things like markets because\nIt's red emotional it's it's exciting all of your

yesterday repeated his criticism of Federal Reserve policy at one point he said I think I Know about it better than they do believe me unquote he also said raising interest rates was insane\nBut there was some pushback from one of the president's own team today let's check in with Christopher load the chief economist at the end financial in New York morning Chris\nGood morning David\nNow this morning Chris the U.S treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed gently back against the president who's been criticizing the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates for much of the week ...

echoing that\nFeeling considering that criticism from the oval office that shit I suspect what the president is doing is what we call you know cover your but the fed is tightening it's a really tricky ...\nUh in the past they pulled off what we call a soft landing wants the rest of the time when they tighten there's a recession and by criticizing the fed now the president gains some credibility
