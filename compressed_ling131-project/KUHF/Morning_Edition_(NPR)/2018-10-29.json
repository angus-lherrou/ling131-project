to weld updates on that day\nPlastic was a great invention\nA but since the fifties I Would say\nUh the production has been exponential I don't know if you say that in English and now are the oceans are beaches are are dying from the past take um the species are dying um uh the fish are dying and at the end of the day we are eating plastic there's plastic and remarried\nSo we have to act Europe

incredibly high volume thirty like value at the material and a huge amount of it leaks out in the ... a very different route\nHow's industrial foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce that\nWell the goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a secular economy which is an economic model\nWhich difference to my current current is very lenient tighten might disposed we take them at their lack the ground could make something after that and then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example within a secular economy you ten a straight line and you turn it into a cycle that\nYou design the economy so that waste is effectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generating natural systems what we're doing around plastic packaging\nNever those three areas it's about being regenerative restarted it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it the innovating around the packaging that we do so that is one hundred percent recyclable combustible or a usable\nAnd then the fed area it's the second that material once it's been

takes over how does the process begin\n[noise] well I think um [noise] what you mentioned just before that I could I make it probably would not be prepared\nTo to to to candidate again for\nFor the position of power the leader that there will be several options we were talking a lot about on the ground or come carbon power was secretary general of the city will and we were talking about in the

punishment such as it melts former faction leader of the CDC is who who than um went out of politics and is working and the economy and in banking for the moment being but who could probably return\nAnd the way the ... the CDC has lost power ongoing American lives lost support it is that in your view connected almost directly with a decision in twenty Fifteen to persuade the power to persuade the country to welcome a million refugees\nWas she didn't welcome a million refugees but she saw in that time that there was a humanitarian crisis from Austria to Hungary alarmed about a kind of rude and that Germany at the duty to help those people to avoid a very difficult situation along that road\nUh but nevertheless you're right the problem we were the problems we're facing or so in this very moment with is hundreds of thousands of refugees are huge and a lot bigger than most of us would have thought in the beginning\nAnd I think um if you look at the results there is two

the greens did very well in the lead candidate certainly doesn't have a German name does he\nKnew he definitely at the greens are very interesting talking\nThe campaign John on the ground on housing on bread and butter issues but it's a very interesting thing about this green phenomena as some of the very at the recent elections except they now are holding dissenter Germany still has to tend to

President Trump is thrust a caravan of migrants to the center of the Republican election campaign\nThough it is still far from the U.S border the caravan is on Mexican soil and our next guest represents the country with responsibility for just now Iran will go to the artists as Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador good morning\nGood morning Steve I I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing here Steve is really a humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things are urging people to winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugees that those two all those people from Central America to request that including\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the end the phone with Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have ... trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status of so police there is simply to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offered them refugee status I Believe you said and yet the leader of this group seem from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with\nA sign of well out of ah the the number that we have a store on three thousand five hundred people are out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugees that was\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand I mention of for foreign original coastal five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugee status\nOr this is important in front of us perspective and best or because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have goals corporation where U.S authorities to handle this in the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the Caribbean and such\nIs around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and the ... the situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with the U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that are these huge scandal that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\nAmbassador thanks very much
