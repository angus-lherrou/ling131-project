tried to get her party behind some plan for Brexit\nIn just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this Hi there Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times that conservatives have gotten failed to agree\nWell ... is the time is running out as you point out I think that's what it is creating a lot of tension here\nIs there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and intricate negotiation of the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't get the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either she gave a speech today a lot of it's going to be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has to say what have her critics said well she has a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent one is a man named Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister [noise]\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... a job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the you still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent and independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday\nIf we get it wrong army proceed with these on democratic solution if you made in ... we will protect these talks the tedious business\nToxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister responded\nWell she put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV he she said Boris and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show one of her criticisms is that the plan that Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new hard border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the border is seamless you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concern that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is do avoid a border of any kind of\nBehind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe the Titanic had important iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what a what a rank and file conservative thinking this\nWell I I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may is it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream\nAnd wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy for such a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east Hampshire conservative association and and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHave would be great to have the big picture great inspiring people but he would need to have a lot of the envelope and deal with the the so\nWould you want to see him as a future Pam [noise]\nYes and no I'm undecided\nI Am a supporter of or is he he's a ... character\nYou either love him on the um ...\nCharacter in some of it as an expression

is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept the ...\n[noise] well that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting Steve is we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board or the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see\nWhat she's going to come up with negotiations right now seems stalled um and we just got to meeting two weeks to go on and the concern is if they don't come up with the deal they could you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage to the economy here NPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with you sir happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alerts just is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it'll be good for the president to be able to speak directly to\nBut this is where Dr Read lender has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her effect that the president might be using such a shift for political purposes or it create a diversion of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure sure I I liked about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system\nKnown as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and besides has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington\nAnd coming up later today on all things

the climate Donald was walking on a busy Chicago street he had a knife and didn't drop it after police ordered him to do so\nFor the future if there was a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out together and they really don't want her to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray\nIt's why they were black robes and they sit behind a lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's going to subdue says we didn't do anything or does remember doing everything what is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it\nBut his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking and an arrow were not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom\nThe judge would be shocked um so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate\nBut not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices recused themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument of you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I ... I don't know that I Would make that argument that far ... like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nAll because President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and vote for him right\nI think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob as she'll be American Constitution society thanks so much thank\nYou a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele kill them in\nA State Department official says marriage equality is the love the land here in the U.

[noise]\nI wouldn't say violence or unrest but the desperation in people\nLining the roads are small children\nAnd they're chasing you and they're asking for food and they're holding up signs that say we also need food we need to need food there was a sense that column was getting more of the attention\nThen some of the other areas like um ... which has been very very badly hit and still being explored as to the extent of\nOf the damage there but you approach this and you see obviously you know the the marks of\nDestruction along the coast or the houses are destroyed on both sides of the road and then as you move into Paul do you see along the bay\nJust nothing but houses that have been snapped like twigs UC\nCement homes that are leaning in into the bay and every part of human existence is strewn among the debris so you know something very powerful came through here have you had a chance to talk with survivors yet\nYou know I did and I of course you ask them what was that like um and generally you knew they look at you and they say we were just panicked\nAnd there was no time to act\nIn fact one man said I my sense is just went blank and I turned and I I felt the quake and I turned and almost immediately he said he\nSaw a wall of water and he said you may think we sound selfish I sound selfish to say this but all I could think of was to run I didn't even think of how I was going to save\nMy father in this disaster\nAnd his father indeed has ... has perished his\nHouse is gone and his livelihood is gone and he goes and he sits there with his friends and they figure out how they're going to rebuild their lives and these were people who lived along the beach you know they had cafes along the beach and now they have absolutely nothing and they go from area to area trying to find food and water\nHow are they coping with that I mean is aid getting through to these people who need it most\nWill aid is slowly making its way into this devastated region the central government is putting a priority it says on transportation and and waste treatment and a a tense and and and generators you know there seems to be a disconnect you see this disconnect where the government\nAbout how it has reached out to the international community and and and that that they are responding and a lot of international communities will say yes but\nWe're burdened by a

us from the city of ... on the Indonesian island of ... thanks so much Julie thank you\n[noise]\n\nJust days ago President Trump said testimony against his Supreme Court nominee was credible political speech last night in Mississippi the president shifted to mocking Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault but didn't recall every detail\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when the president's mockery\nCame at the same time that the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges if possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check is and is not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nBreaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nBus with sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court\nCatch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty apparent to the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others that\nSteven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned a song so any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump Lee is a retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crimes cases and now he hopes to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances scaring from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News

defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he\nNeeded to convince the jury of his that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his life life that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been

giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examine that emotion and sadness went away the

didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed

holding up signs that say we also need food we need to need food there is a sense that ... was getting more of the attention\nThan some of the other areas like I'm done the law which has been very very badly hit and still being explored as to the extent of\nThe damage there but you approach this and you see obviously you know the the marks of\nDestruction along the coast or the houses are

and every part of human existence is strewn among the debris so you know something very powerful came through here have you had a chance to talk with survivors yet\nYou know I did and I of course you ask them what was that like um and generally you knew they look at you and they say we were just panicked\nAnd there was no time to act\nIn fact one man said I my sense is just went blank and I turned and I\nI felt the quake and I turned and almost immediately he said he saw a wall of water and he said you may think we sound selfish I sound selfish to say this but all I could think of was to run I didn't even think of how I was going to save my father in this disaster\nAnd his father indeed has ... has perished\nHis house is gone and his livelihood is gone and he goes and he sits there with his

Julie McCarthy\nSpeaking to us from the city of ... on the Indonesian island of see the way the thanks so much Julie thank you [noise]\n\n\nJust days ago President Trump said testimony against his Supreme Court nominee was credible political speech last night in Mississippi the president shifted to mocking Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault but didn't recall every detail\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where I don't remember how many residents mockery\nCame at the same time but the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check use and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nBreaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described rather\nBut with the sexual assault delegations within the Supreme Court\nTo catch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents of the people who usually do does the local police\nWere falling at a little bit to some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ...\nThe Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how\nPublic that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim they're told through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI marching costs the NPR News\n[noise]\nHad seen forty two on Wednesday and It's MORNING edition here on your
