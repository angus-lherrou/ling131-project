a this is such a wasteful use of taxpayers' money\nIf you wish to go ahead I Will require a written direction or this is something which is quite unusual but I felt that this was a such a waste of money that I was not prepared to take personal responsibility for\nIt was another couple of years before the story broke in October Nineteen Ninety three when the national oldest office the policies

[noise]\n\n[noise] this is Dan Damon in London where there is a Brexit die mentioned almost every story in Britain at the moment and part of that has been the telling\nHistory was the British Empire a good thing or not for example the new report by the row Historical Society and the u._k. illustrates what's called the white washing of history and wants to make the teaching of history more diverse\nWe're joined by this society is president professor ... thank you so much professor\nFor being with us up by ... this is about people of color but some of whom you came here as politics Britain's relationship um control of its empire just on that point how well is the story of the empire told to do things\nAre not very well it's an island ... research on this topic is rich and improving by the minute and certainly not in the curriculum is taking a good step more time\nAnd is the material available but how was it written down in a way that can be researched\nAccessing voices of precedents I'm In the umpires often difficult stuff where much faster at doing that today than we were five ten years ago\nThere are people who say that there's enough to be taught with the things that children have to learn\nAbout for example the politics of the twentieth century the extremism that's led to so many very dangerous and deadly wars is this tinkering with history to make it a little less white is that essential in in view of all the other things that need to be\nTool it's which will lead to political awareness\nI think that what we're most interested in happening is that stature history rich history and more accurate history is taught I find it very difficult to believe that we can tell that sort of history\nAnd without having a more diverse approach to history become possibly teach go ... all of history ah I'd rather they learned rather less range land get better\nCould you give an example of the kinds of things I Do think is not taught well enough specific instances\nWell the argument that British straight really and they became a diverse history ethnically racially I'm from the era of wind rush on alert that already has such rate substantial parts of the past for example we have a broader point however which really is that\nThe history of places that we may think of as being in the umpire needs to be told from the perspective of those places as well as as a part of British estate\nIndeed when Russia of course that was perhaps or one of the most important incidents that brought people from the Caribbean to ah help in the health service and others are other parts of British society\nAt the end of the second World War but of course there were many black people fighting in not only the second but the first World War as well so that part of the story I think it's beginning to be told but not enough\nYeah or they get any holiday of that\nHistorical message is definitely improved dramatically and we can see this in the recent a stark work and historical teaching about the first World War that we can get much much further before that as well and tell these braided strain that remind us that British history has not only are white history\nFederal ideas just matched he's an idea of stages to creation options to extend the invitation for a few months and it would only be for my mom's\nNot feeling is that the seasonal extent because we are working to ensure that we have that feature relationship in ... by the end of December twenty tend to find some natural way with\nPrime minister Theresa May speaking this morning well we're joined by senator Neal Richmond who speaks on European ... to go in the Irish Senate in Dublin or they are the policy of the Irish prime minister liver\nAnd Neil thanks very much for coming in does this idea of an extension does that give you all your government any confidence that there will be in the un something that will avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nOr I think that even extension is certainly nothing something that we don't ... if if that's what's needed in order to harm right the deep meaningful trading customs relationship and get the details on the technicalities and so beers however it's very clear that this cannot replace the need for a box up for the Irish border I Can't be a time there was a box up\nSo we'll discuss it in for the ... prime minister may last night did a good ... and everyone's in the same sort of going the same direction we need to get a deal and if this makes getting a deal more like the unlimited amateur brag just than we have to look at a property\nAnd prime minister ... ... I think showed the prime minister an article from the Irish Times about a bombing other customs post back in Nineteen Seventy two\nUh the uh plenty of examples I think the the customs post in ... in ... was bombed countless times many people was shot that it's important to emphasize that this is not just some kind of vague idea that the bullet that would be dangerous it it it's it's real\nIt's very real and a lot of people don't get quite offensive and people trying to say we're dramatizing this or even worse recognizing us it's the station opinion of George Hamilton chief come to the police are is Northern Ireland that's\nA hard questions border will lead to return to violence in the side on the environment we have many dissident parmesan cheese involved and very lucrative smuggling rings racketeering wings\nOn the prospect of a hard border could easily see that read marriage in what is a toxic situation and\nWhat about those arrangements for example between Norway and Sweden or between France and Switzerland I mean there are customs checks not all the time but they do exist they delayed lotteries a bit would that be acceptable\nNo they're completely and comparable and the Irish border as foreigners nice nine kilometers long has two hundred and eight crossings the Swedish border as ... crossings but you can only bring commercial goods across trials in a number of them as you say close ... but the most important things\nThose borders aren't subject to an international peace tree she launched with the United nations in terms of the good friday agreement a hard border we feel we Contra bench and all that Good Friday agreement a harsh government is a ... we've responsibility to protect athletes by protecting piece\nMeal thanks very much indeed Neal Richmond to speak on behalf of the uh three and a girl and lived for ... the prime minister's party in the Senate thanks for coming into our studio\nWith us discuss where we are and where we're going with a ... men on who's director of the u._k. and a changing Europe it's a research group on UK ear relations and also we can hear from Bridget laughing or who's in Florence initially direct with Robert Schumann Center for advanced studies of the global governance Programme\nLet me ask you first and it is that the movement here the special so much for November that's been cancelled could can you still see a deal shape it\nHas been movement yes I think it's worth remembering the over the course of the last week when the negotiators have been set down in the total was cool it they have made a lot of progress them all sorts of issues the sticking point remains the R respects doping that is cool in between\nThe negotiators in Brussels politics back home and that's the problem to reason my faces I think she knows what she needs to do to compromise and get a deal the question is she doesn't know that she can get it through her cabinet or Republican\nSo British Left and does that mean that actually what you're hearing from Europeans are over on the continent is that no deal is shaping up to be the outcome\nNo fault for I think is happening is the European Council is offering creates a mate time it's asking the to negotiating team to get back to work\nAnd if ... says at any stage in early November that there's enough\nAnd nothing's been achieved to warrant to European Council than there will be a European Council\nSo I think this is back to the table it's a question all how ... can be done to waltz already being agreed\nThat will enable treats and they sign up to us\nBut I think it's also important for me to say I as I heard Neal Richmond there is no way that any Irish Government were sign up to eight withdrawal agreement that\nDoes not include a legally binding backstop with as a time limit there can be no time limit I think that's written in it that's written in ...\n... exactly and what about ... what about a ... point that that is something that may not be possible for three of them made it to get through not only the parliament in Britain but her own party in ...\nWell then that's unfortunate teen opens up the new deal scenario because without a withdrawal agreement there can be no orderly withdrawal\nI think both sides do not want that outcome both sides are determined to work very hard but it would be wrong with me to give the audience the u._k. audience a sense that this was ... that that was ... room on a weekly binding backstop there isn't\nBut also we must remember that this is ... ... ... this is not something the U.S asking\nCrease in may international in March of this heat in March of the year said I Am committed to a green and the withdrawal agreement operation that lead to text for at least the so called backstop options ... in the ... report on what she said\nYeah and and I think the repeated in much made the commitment to December and made it to a repetition in much I'm On a minute and just finally ... talking to a global audience ... what is this\nTo do to the European economy to the economy of Britain and its relations with other trading partners\nWill look as president said no one woman's no deal because everyone knows that there'll be damaged the damage will mainly in the United kingdom but it will also be two of the member states ... everyone wants to avoid this and I think back to the moment\nIs the biggest factor that means I'm Still relatively confident we will arrive at a deal simply because we'll to the super be bad\nBut there's no doubts about that that Brexit is going to have a a negative impact on the British economy because the government has signed up to a program of leaving the single market and the customs union there was no way of doing that without introducing barriers to trade with the law just the closest trading partners so the economic impact will be negative\nAnd then ... from the u._k. and are changing Europe thank you and Bridget left and from the Truman Center for advanced studies in Florence thanks for helping us we have to cover this day by day because it changes day by day and as an an said the impact not just on the economy but on the\nCountries of which the u._k. trades is very important\nFor us we've been on there that apartment for international development or in the u._k. has become hosting an international summit on taxing sexual exploitation of abuse in our spent in the aid second to\nLast me tonight as a consultant to that ... to ... to the un report on sexual exploitation\nAnd the ... in West Africa and joins us now\nThanks so much in deed for being with us or you were critical of the previous proposals which was\nTo do a register of old age because now this is an attempt type things to try and find out that those who have been accused of sexual exploitation or abuse or could at least be registered an stopped\nGoing out to countries in the ... are you more comfortable with that\nAnd she had just come out to the ... the state announced they things that they're still working on these ... and they do say\nMaking checks on and and sexual practices and said that top convictions since intensive ... and they the idea of these that there'll be named to poll just said that agencies can check to see that stuff they went to the past record\nNow I still have grave concerns about that and I just feel it's missing them off because it would be lying say John ... convictions set you know ... you know these kinds of incidents and not do not result in convictions they talking about countries dissipate county new or not and they function in criminal justice system say\nExactly how would you identify if somebody is at a place where there's society has broken down where there was the record yeah but what is going to be done then because it's obvious the people in desperate need of very vulnerable to people whose ambitions on not just to help them\nWell I mean I mean what was really missing to me and in the presentation was that I didn't really see an end to see some complaints mechanisms I mean let's get back to basic ... first of all these people at least and allow them to make you can paint and race a consent\nAnd said there really wasn't fantasies on not seen a film I slept putting the copy for the holes and getting to check registers when people hadn't even had a chance to complain\nSo do you think that every suddenly the the launch of missions aid mission should have kind of safeguarding offices\nOh absolutely I mean not just a notch missions I mean every organization she'd have

going to read part of that ... you know quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result the Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate\nHe goes on there was a time when journalists believe the Internet with liberate information from the censorship and control associated with print media but these governments who's very existence relies on the control of information have aggressively blocked the

back home what did he say how was he struggling with that beyond just beyond writing about it what other steps did he want to take\nVery often I mean in this last comic standing very often is pieces that he wrote for the post he would call attention to 'em reformers and activists who are also being detained and and jailed um so\nI think for him um it was keeping a awareness on on these these people and these are just the people that we know about you know there are hundreds if not thousands of others who've been detained or or disappeared under\nUnder crown prince Mohammed bin ... so I think he he definitely thought that um this is something he he didn't agree with and he he always used to say Saudi Arabia it was not always like this\nDid he ever talk or you know a man who spent most of his life in Saudi Arabia did he ever talk about having friends or colleagues who still supported the regime and and how difficult that that must have been\nSure and I again I mean Jamal

Associated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want to blame if the GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nAnd not only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the\nPresident and why is that well first of all because Trump has\nHas tried to make it about him for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for a vote for me to receive is a vote for me remember the\nMan or a gender to make America great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because of the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nMichelle pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot\nEvery single one of them at the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama his approval rating at the time was in the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're probably going to come in through at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election Trump bake more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of

have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things

out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent was a majority but sixty eight

companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders had pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they

have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole at the big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been

good morning\nSo you have known to the mall 'cause she'll do for a long time last night the Washington Post published a column that he wrote that his editors got the day after he was reported missing and the headline is what the Arab world needs most is free expression and this call him basically condemns Arab governments for their crackdowns on the press\nI Wonder when you read this column what stands out to you\n[noise] you know what strikes me is that he's written his own hope that\nHe spent most of his life in newsrooms he care passionately about the free press and he was often fired for crossing some line than an Arab official didn't like\nWhat turns out to be my last conversation with him was he wanted to open a public broadcasting television station that would broadcast into the Arab world and he said he had the funds to do it\nThis is interesting so he he had big plans you know in his column he does not mention him by name but it's clear that cause showed gee is talking about crown prince Mohammed bin ... on until the scandal the crown prince had become kind of a darling of of the west including here in the U.

politics or at least in political revenge is expected to push mid term turn out to levels that we haven't seen in decades\nRight early voting is underway and twenty states yesterday was the first day for voters in Tennessee to cast early ballots county election commission offices reported that lines were long in Georgia absentee voting has roughly doubled compared with this point in the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nNPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro has been following all this morning to go go morning or he's all lines out the door at polling places voter turnout at numbers not seen in decades what's going on here\nWell look actually I I spoke with a turnout expert yesterday Michael McDonald at the University of Florida and he's forecasting that this year turnout is expected to jump to between forty five and fifty percent\nAnd that is remarkable for mid term generally midterms are pretty low turnout affairs only about foreign ten people who are eligible to vote cast ballots we'd a record low for Seventy years found in twenty fourteen and\nI you know that kind of turnout has not been seen since the mid Nineteen sixties if it gets to forty five fifty percent and of course that was another time of social and cultural upheaval\nYeah that's a really interesting point what does a Mr McDonnell base his predictions on\nHe said he bases on essentially for things one that there is high turnout in primaries there was high turnout in special elections\nHigh self reported interest in the election and that these high levels of early voting that we've been talking about that they're taking place at all of those things all those indicators are pointing in the same direction McDonald told me quote it's probably going to be a turnout rate than most people have never experienced in their lives for mid term elections\nPretty excited [laughter] President Trump is headed to Montana today which is the start of a three day campaign trip to rally Republican voters so what seems is he going to be hammering on as we get closer to election day\nWell he's all about what he's dubbed the liberal angry mob or just last night he tweeted head of his Montana trip about democratic incumbent Senator Jon tester and how he's quote worse than the Democrat mob and he's talking about because when testers office released information\nThat a doctor Ronny Jackson in the White House had fostered a hostile work environment that Jackson wound up a withdrawing his nomination as a secretary\nOr and despite his withdraw now Trump is digging in saying that\nYou know test or behaved worse than the than the Democrat mob did with justice K that being justice Kavanaugh look this is pretty transparent no well this is really has to do with Trump trying to keep the GOP based fired up heading into November we know what the Kavanaugh a confirmation battle did to Republican enthusiasm and spiking that\nTesters favored to win in one of these states Trump won in in twenty sixteen and they're competitive races in Nevada and Arizona as well where Trump is also having\nThem in the last question for you real quick how does a high early voting numbers affect turnout on the actual election day Tuesday November ...\nWell you know if you have something like a third of people turning out to vote early in this election could lessen lines and make it easier to vote on election day itself but overall it'll bring the floor way up a which is what a lot of people are predicting now\nNPR's Dominican months and our thanks to medical You're welcome\nAll right so there were hopes for a deal to ease the departure of the United kingdom out of the e you but\nThose hopes are fading after summit in Brussels that ended with no deal\nRight and there are no

having their financial future sabotage\nAnd several other states are suing the different service or ... claiming it's made mistakes too and broken the law\nIn the past both companies have denied these allegations saying it isn't their fault they're just following the rules set out for them by Congress and the education department and that they're doing their best they say to resolve bar were complaints\nNeither company wanted to talk for this story you know who did the students who thought they were going to get their loans forgiven but aren't\nI made life decisions based on wrong information\nSarah ... says her service or told her she qualified for a loan forgiveness she's teaching now has been in public service for six years and thought she had just four to go but recently she called the ed department and someone told her\nOh I'm Sorry but you don't qualify not until you consolidate your loans\nBut she was told if she does that her count down to forgiveness would reset back to ten years\nI can kind of let my guard down and said he had this kind of sucks and she said yeah it really sucks [laughter]\nTwenty nine thousand applications for public service loan

from west known north flew to get to the north side of life when he finds and more frequent and said to his team It's MORNING edition\nFrom NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I knew well king the Washington Post has run what is believed to be the last column written by Saudi journalist ... he's the writer who disappeared after walking into the Saudi conflict ... earlier this month\nTurkish officials say the Saudi Government murdered him by President Trump says the U.S needs more evidence before holding the Saudis responsible\nWe've asked for it if it exists rises I don't know I'm not sure yet that didn't exist probably does passively does\nTurkish media report in the existence of a recording yesterday it allegedly captured the last moments of ... life\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has denied any involvement in the disappearance but some lawmakers are calling for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable Senator Chris Murphy is one of him he's a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations committee to morning senator\nMorning do you feel certain that you know what happened to ...\nI I don't know that without the evidence that the Turks are reportedly have I can say\nThat I feel ... and um but uh I have seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest the show is alive or everything that I have seen 'em that spoke publicly available and privately available\nLeads me to believe that the Saudis did uh unfortunately murder to show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specifics place\nOr the first thing we've asked is for the president a under a piece of legislation called the Magnitsky Act to do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction\nIndividuals that bit believed order a this execution and so that process is under way the president is required by law to report to us on\nIs finding a job but Congress can't act on its own and I would argue that we should take this step a removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nAre that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think that these she should be linked is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians with their bombing campaign given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to show the I think that it is likely to air also high and two of them have been lying to us for a long time\nAbout what they are doing inside Yemen I of gold you've as many others have that they are in fact\nTargeting civilians inside Yemen with the United states bombs with the United states as systems and that is the case that we shouldn't be any part of that coalition than it would be a I think important message to send to us that if you're not telling us the truth or we're not going to be in business\nUsing making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and us involvement potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you're legislation to stop the U.S support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of an and allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWell I I I Will admit I Am very frustrated that\nOh the United states has been assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen that it hasn't gotten much attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist inside of this conflict\nBut I think it's getting attention now because the two are linked because we'd have supported Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all the suggested otherwise\nAnd so I think and I've been making the case to my colleagues for years but the Saudis aren't telling us the truth I'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open\nTo the prospect that a man Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight with the United states about other things I'm just like he has not been straight with the United states uh about what happened to democracy Avi\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and to question I experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region are those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWell this idea that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how is important well it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past um and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nWe are selling Saudi Arabia\nI'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting that we get on to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting skill in that bachelor degree\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thank you senator take it\n... it was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos dad has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us today thank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post you know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast ... and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach but it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the postage and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing fingers are not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin Salman\nCan you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin ... rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nIn the past both companies have denied these allegations saying it isn't their fault they're just following the rules set out for them by Congress and the education department and that they're doing their best they say to resolve bar were complaints\nNeither company wanted to talk for this story you know who did the students who thought they were going to get their loans forgiven but aren't\nI made life decisions based on wrong information\nSarah ... says her service or told her she qualified for a loan forgiveness she's teaching now has been in public service for six years and thought she had just four to go\nBut recently she called the ed department and someone told her oh I'm Sorry but you don't qualify not until you consolidate your loans\nBut she was told if she does that her count down to forgiveness would reset back to ten years\nI can kind of let my guard down and said this kind of sucks and she said yeah it really sucks [laughter]\nTwenty nine thousand applications for public service loan forgiveness have been process so far and other those Ninety nine percent been tonight in other words syrup ... story is not unusual\nOh well see that's actually a huge relief\nBecause I Walk around with an enormous amount of feeling silly\nIn its defense the education department says everybody who is eligible is being approved and they say they're working on improving the process\nBut ... a former student loan watchdog says the department under President Trump isn't only walking away from the fight to help student loan borrowers they're actually arming the other side in response to all the state law suits against it servicers\nThe Trump Administration is now arguing these companies they're protected from state laws because they work for the federal government\nIn this fight is now being waged in the courts\nMeanwhile Seth fraud men may have left government but he continues to wage his fight for public service loan forgiveness as a private citizen Cory Turner NPR News Washington\nSupport from
