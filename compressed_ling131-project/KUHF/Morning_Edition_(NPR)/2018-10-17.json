morning so Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickle down to them any individual such that they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from a kind of miss and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important than having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly said protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for goods but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to

good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department\nAnd it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to invest\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David\nGoverning so the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new um his critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though on employment is it a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go to fast the expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nOur end the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThe soaring deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years\nWhen you look under this you find a number of elements of but one thing or the jumped out this most recent report as the corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up an at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other\nUh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun a bit reports\nAkins though blame a government spending for the death said Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here\nDoes he have a point [noise] well I think that ah Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt\nTo get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers have government spending as a society ages\nOver the next decade are gonna be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time David Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra open a member

open three sites the election\nEarly but he was very popular in ... county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are this year have responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting on early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring engine debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage county from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has been prefer and has been referred by a certain population and certain populations who's right to vote as not only in our life but has been rejected in recent court decisions\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision that Republican to champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the debate\nWhat we set out with the issue to do is to be able to make it more reliable and dependable voters would know that the early voting site or sites in

a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University and it's led by a conservative activist who was in the past to charge the College of efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move washer with a New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian American skepticism about anything that it's seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian Americans still more poor affirmative action but the um\nThe groups I talk to represent a growing very vocal faction and powered by social media powered by their own and diligent organizers they've hired point in the fact that we in affecting the popular imagination of\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they they're very much into a kind of number protrude mission or or or coach or admissions or isn't actually offer an exercise in reality but are they view the quote unquote penalty tort Asian students\nUm in categories like the personal ranking a very subjective rank and the Harvard offers\nAs a advantageous Asian American\nOr you say numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be it'd be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to pray for ... uh because a lot of them are kind of newer immigrants from mainland China or testing is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count for more than I Am shocked features like leadership or um personal rankings\nIs this debate any different if we move away from an elite university like Harvard to a lesser league university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her infection has whittled down to this question of Harvard 'cause Harvard is an unusual when you're suggesting um when we look at work place\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people in American leaders are supportive of kind of action so this really provides a you'd wind go at and to the issue at all\nOkay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country I Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression\nThat some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks at auction would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before I'm waking up with Edward Blum so you know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to do all along\nCould be able to partner with something someone like Rick blooms sort of serendipitous for both

since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten in any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to them any individual such that they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs it was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people stay they're willing to pay higher prices for goods but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by American campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of ... hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to task told me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important in different pairs and one pair we asked about what is what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies is more important to protecting us jobs\nOr by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low cost an on consumer goods but I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every country that means the ones that we are close

I'm Steve Inskeep and I knew well\nKing good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David\nGoverning I'd say the president has colorfully criticize the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new um he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after\nAll the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up but I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to budget committee hearing last month\nThe story deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements a but one thing that jumped out in this most recent report as the corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent\nOf the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot\nIs clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other I'm at the arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit here Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing ... entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here\nDoes he have a point [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid are fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in\nAnd the big drivers of government spending as a society ages\nOver the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David You're welcome\nThis fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen for two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout\nHere's Alexandra Olga member station WFSU the\nTo prepare for early voting

locations throughout the county but the new law requires all sites within a county to be open from ... to ... pm during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites as election\nBut he was very popular in ... county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters\nVersus are this year have responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting on early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring engine debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage county from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has been prefer and has been referred by certain populations and certain populations who's right to vote as not only in our life but it's been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republican to champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we set out with the issue to do is to be able to make it or reliable dependable voters would know that the early voting site or sites in the county was open for the ... time in the morning to sit on the evening\nThe law has some bipartisan opposition run riot is the Republican Party chair of the ... county about fifty miles north of Charlotte the county I had to cut it early

MIT political scientist Charles Stuart that third says that for voters convenience Trump's hours\nAnd there's a lot of research that's been done that suggests that whenever you move a polling place for the way from a voter they're less likely to vote there\nStewart says the real change could simply shift turn out to election day which could mean longer lines at the polls and the state or voting
