advertised in his uh twenty twelve reelection campaign to Schofield joins us now from Paris some\nFreshly Hugh more on these ... allegations against Mr Sarkozy\nYeah is is that it was the twenty twelve or election it was an attempt to be reelected of course he failed he was beaten by Francois alone in the in the election but it it was quite clear at the time to people observing and suck 'cause he was spending as out who is a sitting president\nAnd was spending an awful lot of money on his campaign and subsequently much said yes he had spent his allotted budget there are strict spending limits in France but how much you can spend the obligation now is that instead of twenty two point five million years what she was in South bend to spend as much as ... million euros\nAnd the ... the criminal aspect of this were to be substantiated is a claim that um there was a lot of folk full accounting going on in the heart of the of the cycles become pain there was a company which was

inside the ... and uh put send some of those bills build the parts of his party rather than the campaign\nAnd that way ... was able to keep the campaign spending down a it's a serious allegation there are a lot of other people um who are charged in connection with the key question about Sarkozy's whether he knew\n'cause if you can sort of say well this is all being done by my left on it's a you know I was busy thinking about policy while they go on with organizing my campaign then then he's in the clear but certainly there are magistrates who think that's not the case and that there was a charge against him to be ...\nWhat's ... Mr Sarkozy's defense that would be enough pun tone or does he denied the allegations\nWell that that there's an admission those are the\nWell I mean his in laws recognize that there was an overspend a much newer overspend and he's a argue and I'm right off of that campaign they looked at\nThe or the accounts and that wasn't going to spend and that meant that he didn't get his money back because it you know if you if you you reimbursed by the state in France if you keep to the rules and you know you're under the limit he blew the limit that meant that the\n... the he didn't get the money reimbursed by the state that that was already a problem for him this is a much bigger problem because it's talking about a far far larger spend about twenty million euros and the as I say he's he's he's\nCases but he doesn't even know about any of this I mean there there is you know there there are separately um cases against people in lower down national news who are accused of actually organizing it's\nA matter of usable either forgery forging the accounts and so on falsifying accounts he's going to use without he's accused of illicit poppy funding which implies that he knew about it I think it'll it'll hinges on whether he knew about it and he says he didn't\nIn fact I briefly um he was at a given now that this case will get a cold\nNo no no no no I'm afraid that goes on and on and on there is another record of appeal to hike or to be able to call to construct your that will be many months before it rules and then if it rules in favor of a trial would be very many months

[noise]\nProblems are meant to save lives when a five takes hold and I'm for instance but it is the most effective way to do with the new U.S study has found that a different sort of ... one that uses a mother's voice will wait children up much more effectively than the standard alarms\nA study of a hundred and Seventy nine children age five to twelve founded a sleeping child was much more likely to be awakened by one of the three voice of lumps tested them by the time to mom\nAnd I didn't I spoke to a nice mix date professor of forensic science of University of Dundee she's done some of the research you can now find says five services and technology companies on how to improve this smoke alarms\nSo what is you make of this new report it\nMembers research work that we carried out here at the University of Sunday Julian ... very well actually for the work that we did look to the combination of a low frequency toner liquor that like what you hear when a truck is reverse and a quarter intimate\nBeeping noises and we combined with the voice of an actor a female actor and we found in in the work we did that that was eighty to Ninety percent more likely to wake at young children the\nAmerican study that's just been published use a recording also mother's voice off to choke I studied and they again so a significant increase\nIn their children waking up as a result of hearing that sound so these are increases above the conventional smoke around that we all have in our house\nNot entirely surprising if you think about it I mean if you are right now the editor for instance in the human voice shouts fire fire fire or you're much more lightning rod be much more likely to get out and I'm hearing a foreigner and um\nI I think that there's that certainly something enough and I think it is the connection between the voice and being able to wake these children whether it has to be their mother's voice or whether it\nCan be your voice somebody out or or work with me down with a recorded voice rather than some children's mother's cells the American study some others will it so it seems to be you're quite correct or to human voice stuff like that you're going to\nShow to just get I mean I mean more customized foreign arms which you mentioned\n... some of those types of devices are already beginning to emerge on to the marketplace and\nThe work that we have done where we want to take it and that is to use the sound that we've been working on um to combine the into already existing devices and in particular devices like mobile phones are smart phones where the sound is triggered\nBy a to a level that if you're from the commercial smoke alarm start where we all have in our houses\nI mean he referred to earlier to the kind of in my mind rather inconsequential bleeping made by a river sharing Laurie is is that are in need to think to sharpen up those kinds of alarms that we encounter every day\nIt's a difficult time to time certainly certainly for the work that we did it was a combination of that\nI think from trying his point of view this is\nProbably a function of Beijing's growing worry about trade tensions with the United states Donald Trump of course has changed the rules of the international game by missing a very aggressive trade policy\nWe're seeing slowing economic growth somewhere in the six point some ... percent level that's a big

by security tensions in the East China sea\nContent contested territorial claims by the Chinese so to send Chinese ships into Japan's for Disney the so called Senkaku Diaoyu islands of trying to refer

facto leader of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject but while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime he said that there would be\nA old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who were trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because I thought she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul\nAnd he struck a very defiant notes saying that those people are trying to drive to sweat will not succeed not well I Am from prince

you know it was a mistake and the uh the ... those ... says the company said must be brought to justice than not losing faith in the original vision he laid out two years ago is this event\nReally

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California President Trump's political career isn't part defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with Mel though he is calling for civility after at least seven apparent pipe bombs were male to his political opponents\nSets right at a rally in Wisconsin last night the president condemned the incident and then he turned his attention to the press\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil to stop the endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nSo far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspect\nAnd we have a lot to talk about here so let's bring in NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and also NPR's national security correspondent Ryan Lucas hello to you both morning could warning Ryan let's start\nWith you um seems like we're talking about seven devices now at least that were mailed out um who were they intended for the first\nWas found Monday outside the home of billionaire investor George Soros is a big contributor to democratic causes and then others were discovered address to Hillary Clinton for President Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and then his a former CIA director John Brennan\nNow the package intended for Britain was center the CNN office in New York it was discovered in the mail room there\nUh and then late last night we got word from the FBI that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were similar and the parents to the others those were addressed Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very sharp critic of the president [noise]\nOkay so the term pipe bomb is being used 'em ... explain more about that what do we know about these devices hum and if anything who might have sent them\nWell and the question of who may have sent them we don't know anything at this point there's no worried about suspects as of yet it's still very early in the in the investigation we do however has some details on the packages and what they contained a and as you said they've been destroyed by officials as a pipe bombs they are potential explosive devices\nOr the packages themselves were mailed in identical bubble wrapped manila envelope so this is a what the FBI says\nThe addresses on them were all computer printed the return address on each package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida ... each package had six U.S Postal service stamps\nOr the package that was addressed to former attorney general Eric Holder it didn't make it to his office was were routed the FBI says it was returned to the uh to the alleged sender so in this case to Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages\nShe said that she's very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this or her own office in Florida actually it was a backyard yesterday because of a suspicious package there\nTen let's turn this over to you for a minute this is a really unusual moment how is the president been reacting to all of this President Trump has been\nCalling for civility he says he he's saying all the things that you would expect the president to say in a time like this saying that at that\nThe ... there's an investigation ongoing that they will bring the people responsible to justice uh and and saying that any acts are threats of political violence or an attack on democracy itself and he said all of that last night at that rally at clearly reading from the teleprompter what\nWas the president's mood like at the rally do you have a sense of that you know it was almost\nLike he was giving a speech that he would give in the White House except he was at this big rally and his rallies are usually these\nThese rockets events where people come for the show 'em and you know it was in an airplane hangar in in Wisconsin\nAnd instead he was giving this very measured speech uh where where he was quite careful not to say the names of any of those people who were were sent a bombs people who tips\nHe talks about in his rally yeah um and ... and he was actually very self conscious about this here's here's a little clip but he was talking about and one of the Senate candidates and\nYou see how nice to have you ever seen [noise]\nBehaving very well [noise] and we can keep it that way right\nAnd the question becomes how long does it stay like that how long does he stay on the teleprompter if you will um you know falling that hearing with Christine Blasey Ford and uh and judge Kavanaugh he he said that she seems credible and he was very measured in the way he talked about her\nAnd then at some point he flipped the switch and he went to one of his rallies and he was highly critical of her and because he he felt that that was the right political thing to do\nWith the president and so far hasn't said anything directly about the people who were targeted but what about them have they said anything\nPublicly uh well Hillary Clinton spoke yesterday and that she did she did say that she said the one that she actually has quite a bit which is that\nShe's not worried about herself she's fine but she's worried about America at John Brennan also spoke a lot of talk about about the political climate that exists at this time\nBrian let me turn back to you I mean so far in these early hours investigators seemed to be suggesting they're not thinking about like possible political motives and stuff they're just literally digging into figure out what happened here so where does this investigation go at this moment well right\nNow the items he's a suspicious packages and the\nA pipe bombs that they contained a they've been collected they're being sent to the FBI lab at Quantico, Virginia will be analyzed there take a look at sort of what type of materials are are in these packages look for fingerprints run other tests on them or to figure out as much as they can and and and clean as much evidence as possible\nUm now the FBI is not working on its own in this investigation this is a very big uh investigation that's underway the secret service has involved the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives is of course and\nEven the U.S postal uh inspection services involved in this because of the the male element now\nFBI Director Christopher Wray has said that this investigation is of the highest priority of the bureau is putting its full weight behind it but this is also something that they can't\nThey can't do all of this on their own uh and re has actually made an appeal to anyone in the public who might have information that could be used to the FBI in this investigation to come forward and contact the FBI and and tell them what they what they have\nOkay and obviously NPR is going to be continuing to cover this story as it evolves will keep on top of it on the radio and also a NPR dot org NPR's Ryan Lucas and Tim Rickey that we really appreciate it thank you both You're welcome thank you\n[noise]\nAre we want to turn out of Saudi Arabia where Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin some on has not let

Riyadh and joins us on the line now had there been hello David\nWill talk to me about how the crown prince is handling this moment obviously wanting to position in this country as as an open modern place but with these allegations that it should be complicated what what is he saying\nWhether it was a day of high drama anticipation yesterday because these were the first comments by the crown prince since the murder of a hassle Jay earlier this month\nAnd everything as we should say we should say killing is is the way many are describing it but I'm tired of the murders if something

morning and that is under investigation I Want to turn now to New York governor Andrew Cuomo who obviously has been following all of these events governor good morning and thank you for taking the time for us\nGood morning thank you for having\nCan we talk about what's happening at this moment on this investigation into another package it sounds like in Tribeca what do you know\nA there was an investigation into a suspicious package or interact background as you said correctly\nOr at the business residents of Robert De Niro the act a reactor or who is a a great great actors personal friend of mine is a great New Yorker\nUh he's also a has a political voice and he's also spoken out on his political opinions\nSo that's ongoing literally as we speak\n[noise] um the other packages had been described as pipe bombs by officials do do you know if if this one is indeed that as well and if it if it's related to the others\nIt is a similar looking package or we don't know yet or if it has the same as the packages that we've seen thus far\nI I Want to ask you yesterday afternoon you said you were directing state law enforcement to double security a vital transportation assets across New York um is there is some reason to believe that the transit systems in your state could be targeted as part of all this\nAnd the situation like this uh I've been governor of New York for seven years I've traced many terrorists in situations\nAnd this works on multiple levels but first level is a do a full investigation let's find the person or people involved video cameras people many of these packages or where several of these factors were dropped off fingerprints et cetera\nSecond especially in New York you want to retain the sense of control you want people to know that Iraq in your acting appropriately MVSA\nA fear is the intent and we are trying to counter fear so we've deployed National Guard we've doubled the state police you'll see more of a police presence in New York\nUh your point is right but what this had to do with a suspicious package but we have to be careful that in this situation it doesn't involve into something else because we really don't know what we're dealing with right\nAh and we have had a different types of terrorist attacks in New York bombs or a truck a people using trucks to kill people\nSo we weren't New Yorkers to know that we're taking every precaution they should come to work they should feel safe don't let the terrorists win or there's no reason to be afraid\nBut but I I could see a lot of New Yorkers I mean if they're going to work this morning and seeing a huge police presence getting a message from you that\nThat there is something very tense and potentially something to fear here that this might go beyond um packages being mailed um you know if they're seeing police all over the place or are you worried that this is something much more serious [noise] uh\nWe have no information that would make is worried it is the normal protocol in response ah we've had a a bombs is found in subways we've had\nA a trucks used to mowed down people in a terrorist attack\nAnd our response is all the ways to increased police presence all across the board just as a matter of protection\nWe've found that doesn't along but it actually comes first we have the best law enforcement agencies on my pillow we all work together we have the FBI or terrorism task force state police\nAre and that's what people will see their accustomed to seeing that also [noise] uh and we have found over the years that it actually reassure\nWhat what are the next steps now in in in the investigation governor what can you tell us about the investigation as of this morning\nThe investigation will go on several levels first you have the actual police investigation who sent the packages fingerprints on the tape\nA postal inspection inspecting the devices themselves a then you have a second level of investigation what is the motivation\nWas the motivation to show which one would have ... wearing a you're setting a bomb a it was they were different motivation that these were bombs or what not intended for actually blow up but just to scare to intimidate\nBecause as a heavy political overlay of this strike a I was a former attorney general former prosecutor I don't want to jump to any college but\nSurely asking me when you talk about the political motivations is political unity possible at this moment as as many are calling for\nLook we haven't had a political unity since our founding fathers thought\nOh I have Republicans in the state I have passed the very controversial legislation with marriage equality which was a controversial minimum wages cetera you can have a political debate without political violence\nAnd that's what we have to remember we're not asking for political unity civility the corn and parameters on that debate\nA and it's never come to this level where there's violence either as in some edition or violence to actually her\nOr New York governor Andrew Cuomo thanks so much for your time as governor\n... President Trump has often said that his most important legacy will be the judges he appoints not just to the Supreme Court but to the lower court says well\nLower court nominations don't get a lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions\nThat are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees now those traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat and the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rules that preventive action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone is the practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone as the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during the recession but for judicial nominees to Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house stinks\nPeople wanting it to grow and wanting it to be the best they can be and people that would prefer that everyone back off and let them do what they want\nIt's pressing here because this town is

decades ago\nCareer options are scares some petty crimes go unpunished and like much of rural America drug abuse is widespread\nEven though we're roll the idea that we're saying is that really there anymore\nRoxy Murphy covers though for the Mary Kennedy advocate newspaper\nThere is no way that this community will be able to fix that drug problem by themselves in order to do that they would need more money and more resources that they don't have\nBut it's not like bills getting up and that's another thing that popped out in NPR's rural poll Robert Blendon says ... half of those surveyed say their community problems can be sold within five years\nIt is not all a world of Oprah's less as many others are described as a great deal of them is that we can deal with these issues if we can get outside help\n... says that those looking for outside help three out of five expected to come from government especially\nState governed\nProblem is state money is getting harder to come this is\nThe

hopefully any water tower the buck Showalter city hall says the city is often turn down\nBecause it's so competitive a lot of communities a lot of places need help some times it's pretty slim\nJonathan ... at the center for rural affairs says state budget cuts are taking a heavy toll on small towns that depend on government funding more than their residents tend to realize and he says that with state funding drying up appreciation for it may be grilling\nThis is symptomatic of a country that is reevaluating itself and re evaluating its decisions and realizing the importance of civic ... structure and the importance of being part of a community and part of a state where we're all Pullman at the same direction I think this could be a positive sign\n... says that if real hostility towards government is in fact easing the optimism that many rural residents feel about solving persistent drug in economic problems may be justified for NPR News I'm Frank Morris in belle
