of of materials\nAnd a reflection very much of that period\nEspecially so because of course what's happened is some of the things that have been recovered a suitcases or pledged in bags and things like that\nAnd they're extraordinary because they're a microcosm of someone's life in someone's intentions in that bag that they took with him and said they liked me Tom captured and because I've been in closed and not open to the general see\nThey have been preserved wise you wouldn't expect so there are ... materials their diaries there are individual materials that relate very specifically to a

know why I think the real value in this collection is it's social value rather than it purely saying intense amount of three times in the ... and all that sort of thing\nAnd you believe that these items belong in museums\nAbsolutely the principles with with any cultural heritage is if you have a ... you take that collection together\nSo if you are I decided we'd like one of the ... you know there's many of them so we'll just take one and we'll put that in a museum somewhere in the world who knows better still will sell it off you know I've got lots of money you know I'll buy that

just this to collectors and others around the world\nAt the moment that you're being out there don't you buy hedge fund\n[noise] yes what happened was that these companies started collecting material back in the eighties\nBut I've had that collections or something that he is about the company that they had passed all has gone bankrupt by going bankrupt or caused by invulnerable in America to tilt bankruptcy hearing and the potential to collection being broken up and sold off piecemeal\nAnd that would be an absolute travesty we've been started some too easy to go to Shawn secure this collection and bring it into public and the ship in perpetuity through to national museums roll museum ... the national marathon museum in Greenwich and also ... the national museums in Northern Ireland\nSo we have to be in an American bankruptcy situation so it's not your normal cultural heritage management\nAnd unfortunately at the last moment we were outbid by a group which has a messiah many of the current owners of the company a powder these ... plus a series of American hedge funds and says I put up the money for it and that's where it currently stands\nAnd they see these artifacts more as an investment today is is that the thinking\nWell I Can't speak for them but in my experience most hated funds tend to tend to take that view on things yes and usually a short time investment Robin Long

very large assembly each\nOf material from one size and which is a collection so it's not as if you got individual off into the recovery one way or another these these out of a time had been recovered and recognized by everyone to be a collection and the court sitting recognize him as a collection\nSo I don't mean to be fair to say this is happening more and more obviously there are people around the world with a lot of money who are interested in whatever the subject matter is whether it be paintings or\nSculptures all his start material and those people they say that came we were trying to acquire things the problem process of people and you want to cherry pick you know they're interested in one place or another piece\nBut he's that's led to happen the collection is despite is broken up

and provides advice to those who support them she was in parliament when the apology was didn't have it\nIt was delivered by bus the prime minister and the leader of the opposition and uh it was obviously very emotional with lots of survivors in the room but it's so hot tells\nIt felt sincere and to survive as it was very meaningful because the government to this country was saying that what's happened to the method it'd been acknowledge the ... been acknowledged that believed that it wasn't their fault\nAnd that was the feeling of ... survivors of sexual abuse in in the audience that he was satisfied with what was said\nLook I mean obviously wasn't ... statements about hundreds of faithful but the people I spoke to the majority fills the times we're starting to change\nBut there was a definite acknowledgement that you know these little words in a bus and those leaders and now we said they just said more action as well and that was appreciated too\nWhat sort of action argue and I was looking for\nLittle Kevin ... there was an announcement today that the national center around child sexual abuse you know looking at research and evidence around ... which is to be welcome to know sudden outspend around the national museum you know like a sort of memorial and the commemoration the people's stories start get lost that they do matter\nI mean obviously from many survivors what they're seeking is support that helps and Fonda in a path to bet a lot and and the posture justice and I suppose that road conditions enabled that with a lot of its recommendations\nSo you've got a lot of ... of symbols ... if you'd like now but what about ... to ... do you think that the victims of sexual abuse ... believed now than they used to be\nThe kind of think it's starting to change I think that there is still some very entrenched fears but certainly in this country we now have a national conversation that does acknowledge that people just\nDoes get others what happened to them that you know it's understandable that need that when you've been patiently betrayed as a child by the very people who are meant to nurture and protect you\nBut that can have profound impact since that understanding in that tolerance is starting to change attitudes that much more needs to happen\nI mean what happened do you miss ... how long did it take before you would have believed\nLook I mean I was ... that I was believe by I mean my my abuse could in the in the home and family and um you know there's still some segments my family that doesn't believe me\nBut I suppose I went through a long process of therapy and support from family and friends and you know go to a place where I was solid in my own belief of myself and my truth and I had enough people who ... to the impact of what had happened to me so you know the prices enabled me to move\nForward I mean that's a more typical ... issue isn't to to address familial sexual abuse Rob of ... which occurs and institutions such as schools churches charities\nYeah look I mean I think you know any incidents of sexual abuse or repeated sexual abuse is very challenging but you know what was the knowledge today also was that\nThis was an apology for survivors of the ... outside of institutions as well acknowledging that abuse occurs in the home and the family in the neighborhood and that it's not just sexual abuse impacts ... seen that physical and emotional abuse and growing up with family violence or\nYou know they're starting to be a much broader understanding that we we really must not have a hierarchy of trauma that everyone who's experienced trauma in childhood or adults would for that matter they wrote support so that people can Rick have because we know that people do the right support\nYou yourself are you a happy hour you anymore contented off to this apology from the prime minister\n[noise] you know ... it's been a very big day [laughter]\nAnd there's a lot to price is so demand is I'm pretty stood up I was sitting next to someone whose sister had committed suicide as a result of what had happened to her and she was serving in Iraq through the apology is as the certainly understandable\nSo you know I think it'll take a while to to really persist is and and think about it but you know I can sit and they said that was a very substantial meaningful day for many

I'm there has been an attempt of\nTrying to naturalized hit fastest them or is being a candidate within that democracy and being a right wing candidate which both are not clearly is not an extreme right wing candidate and at the moment he is and go ... also in accusations of a legal campaigning practice\nOf using what's up to spread fake can you end up as they didn't election\nSo the problem here it's not just in relation to the Workers Party but also how are the open notes from a shadow alchemy of the center right\nFrom ... to ... have been at a disadvantage because of the legal campaigning practices that today upcoming across and with documents to prove them at a lecture justice has just accept it\nA request from ... to investigate both for NATO and these accusations which could lead came to be um a tent unelectable and he could be electable for eight years so what we have is a very complex and audio and his rhetoric is showing took it's proving\nI'm correct what many Democrats already worried about that it's beyond simply a right wing rhetoric\nSo you think he is absolutely ... road that uh if he is elected president he will in some way or another attempt to make the workers policy and indeed go ...\nWell it's not just about this is what I'm trying to explain it's not just about um a knowing that left this goes much deeper than that his rhetorical is against minorities um\nThere's been a a spike in hate crimes\nAgainst gays against blacks and also um there's been recently of the campaign from women who have object that we don't want to uh uh both on our end the presidency so it's and it's very complex to a naturalized came and assume that have simply assuming a right wing stunts because what we have at the moment\nIs a possibility that this election could be a note and another one could be um a cold\nAnd see to me is that not dot which is what would be the ones that would be um uh in in in the second round so this is much more serious and which goes very much beyond simply keeping Lula in jail or not\nSo why is it to to despite these kinds of comments these kinds of views giant ... continues to lead in the opinion polls\nYet this is a very good question and this is exactly what people are finding out is that um he has had\nUm a an extreme support from the ... shop and\nAll the illegal practices of his campaign particularly praying at

E. along with eight PM reports and reveal they found\nThat more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the roles for so called use it or lose it that's a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states that eliminates voters\nWho chose not to vote in primary elections now the Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting is Brian Kemp and camp is also the Republican candidate for governor WABC Johnny Kauffman is with me either Johnny\nHeaded so if this happened in twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why we're focusing on this today\nWell right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor in the country her strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and Democrats in civil rights groups say that\nThese voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so to use it or lose it purges disproportionately\nAffect those voters and they say they really this is the new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction has there been from voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's found a way\nYeah boating has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to a rural southwest Georgia and then visited a small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino\nAnd voter turnout is really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader and he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles to voting like the purchase on here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the pod cast reveal\nIt almost getting people to read mine say that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use it for ...\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a ... was actually someone that was a root for not voting\nShe voted for Obama and two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless you registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have the same day voter registration like some states so the idea that this is creating a\nMindset that voting is a privilege to the idea that there's voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious I'm Serious charges um [noise]\nWhat is secretary Kemp saying in response to to all of that\nWell Kemp points out that he's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy admitted that this year\nAnd he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people\nHe says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters than other secretaries of state but the numbers show a big jump and people were moved a one point six million people since he took over that includes all rule so people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as of this election gets close right\nYeah there have been at least I I think for lawsuits filed in the last week over voting or the big one is over this policy that's disproportionately holding up the voter registration applications of people of color\nThose people can still vote but civil rights advocates are worried about confusion and people getting discouraged um there's some ... a lot of absentee ballots that have been rejected in one county specifically\nAnd uh you know this is a really close race there a few undecided voters both candidates are really trying to motivate their bases and they found that criticizing the other candidate over voting seems like a way to do that\nJohnny Kauffman from member station W.

year the information that board members get to see about a case is unfairly skewed in the officers favor and the board members are political appointees who investigators say generally have had no

executive director of the ice ... artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for coming in\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to\nAutonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general is sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's this new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a ... process wants to know more about or wants the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized but\nThe point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question then some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called confusion ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I Believe about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask John\nStevens is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems at the ice Tripoli he's also author of heart official intelligence that's the word heart there at the beginning embracing our humanity to maximize mushy John haven thank you my pleasure\nThat new ethics certification process also addresses

Georgia\nPurged more than a half million voters from its roles eight percent of registered voters in that state and we're going to focus this morning on some reporting from Johnny Kauffman of member station WBUR a B. E. along with eight PM reports and reveal they found\nThat more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the roles for so called use it\nOr lose it that's a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states that eliminates voters who chose not to vote in primary elections now the Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting is Brian Kemp and camp is also the Republican candidates for governor W. A. B. is Johnny Kauffman is with me either Johnny\nHey David so if this happened and twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why are we focusing on this today\nWell right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor and the country her strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say that\nThese voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and they say they really this is the new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction has there been from voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's found a way\nYeah voting has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to a rural southwest Georgia and then visited the small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino\nAnd voter turnout is really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader and he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles to voting like the purchase on here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost give people the reading my say that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a punter ... was actually someone that was a root for not voting\nShe voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have the same day voter registration like some states so the idea that this is creating\nA mindset that voting is a privilege to the idea that there's voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious I'm Serious charges um\nWhat is secretary Kemp saying in response to to all of that\nWill ... points out that he's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy they did that this year\nAnd he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people he says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters and other secretaries of state\nBut the numbers show a big jump and people were moved by one point six million people since he took over that includes all rule so people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as as as election gets close right\nAnd that's a really good question they had about three billion dollars have been committed by the United states under President Obama\nA about a billion was paid to billions not being held back by President Trump\nSo the green climate fund is now embark on a new round of replenishment as they call it is to try and make up that shortfall but as you say it's pretty difficult and with elections in Brazil coming up they may find the Brazilians are not necessarily willing to help so it could be a tough task over the next few months to help poor countries cope with climate change in the years to come\nMatt McGrath and London thank you so much thank you checking market's\nDown on us and the futures are up five ten percent it was the largest one day rise for stocks traded in Shanghai index they're up more than four percent Chinese official said\nBoost to rush things about China's economy despite the trade war\nThe Trump Administration is still looking at ways that it might label China a currency manipulator over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg News\nHe'd be open to changing the rules used to assess whether a country is playing games with its currency to its advantage marketplaces Nancy Marshall cancer is on the line from Washington so what was the mission talking about\nWell last week treasury said China was not gaining its currency because it didn't meet a series of tests treasury uses the tests are mandated by Congress said they can't change\nIt treasury looks at whether a country has a significant trade surplus with us or if it intervenes repeatedly to drive down the value of the currency knew she didn't tell Bloomberg how he would change these tests but treasury does have some discretion in setting the threshold of the test\nOr why would the U.S treasury want to change those thresholds in a way that could cause China to now fail the test\nThe thinking maybe this would give us some leverage and its trade war with China but keep in mind the u._s. hasn't slap this label on any nation since the Nineteen nineties and China has actually taken some steps to shore up its currency this year Nancy thank you [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm ... doing the numbers is one of the daily features marketplace but as we know those numbers don't nearly tell the full story of this economy

Mexico he told NPR's MORNING EDITION Mexican officials have said they'll stop the migrants but they haven't seemed to do that yet\nI was walking with the caravan yesterday and then we went had a couple of miles because the Mexican police had set up a huge blocking with hundreds of riot police were worried there was going to be another clash and then a couple of minutes later\nMexican police lifted that blockade and the caravan continued marching it's all a so so it's been hard to figure out how Mexico wants to her is going to continue responding to this ah they're still in very far southern Mexico or we don't know Mexico's going to try to use poised to stop this terrible\nJames Frederick reporting President Trump has threatened to close the southern us border is the migrants reach in\nThe Kremlin is reacting cautious later President Trump's intention to withdraw from a landmark nuclear arms treaty NPR's Lucian Kim reports from Moscow the Russian government says it expects us national security adviser John Bolton to clarify the matter\nJohn Bolton arrived in Moscow over the weekend at as expected to hold talks with high ranking officials including president flooding recruiting foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters so far he's only heard about us intentions to withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nPutting spokesman said the U.S hasn't taken any formal steps to exit the treaty that if it does Russia and other countries will be forced to restore the balance of arms\nTreaty was signed in Nineteen eighty seven by then president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev restricting short and medium range nuclear missiles both Washington and Moscow have since accused each other of violating the treaty Hussein ... NPR News Moscow\nFrance says the European Union will not accept a temporary measure to solve the issue of the Irish border in Brexit negotiations NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports the EU is waiting for proposals from London for a permanent solution\nNeater Britain or the European Union want a hard border reinstalled between the republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but they are in disagreement over how to proceed after Britain leaves the AAU\nNow their journey comes amid a U.S election campaign and President Trump made a claim about what kind of people the migrants are with no evidence to back it up\nThese are heartened to see it in terms of people and I don't want them\nWe have a reporter on the line James Frederick who has been reporting on this group and joins us now from Mexico Heather James Hi David so tell us where you are exactly at this moment and and that and tell us about the condition of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in the Central Park of top at Chula Mexico right now it's about twenty miles lord of the border with Guatemala um people here are sleeping right now I mean they're just sleeping on the ground here are the Central Park is packed\nIt was a group rude all day yesterday they walked more than twenty miles from the border to get to this town a temperature got above Ninety degrees\nIt's really humid and and there are tons and tons of children and elderly people here uh you know yesterday was particularly hard for thirty four year old just sell Vasquez crews who I spoke to because she's traveling with her three young children and a sister who has four children for our own\nPlaymate and going up like that\nSo she says it's really hard because the kids have to walk so we brought suitcases so we can store water and food people donate to us for the kids she also said they actually feel kind of lucky to have these little rolling suitcases\n'cause they can get the kids to sit on the suitcases they can hold them along just to make sure they're young kids don't get ... so tired on these really really long arduous walks\nWell I mean we were talking about whether we're talking about exhaustion we're talking about getting supplies and in addition to all of those obstacles that sounds like many questions about what governments were going to do in terms of letting them pass right\nExactly and and it's been really difficult to figure out so far what exactly the Mexican strategy or plan is here so I was walking with a caravan yesterday\nAnd then we went had a couple of miles because the Mexican police had set up a huge block with hundreds of riot police were worried that was going to be another clash and then a couple of minutes later\nMexican police lifted that blockade and the caravan continued marching as normal a so so it's been hard to figure out how Mexico wants to her is going to continue responding to this ah they're still in very far southern Mexico or we don't know Mexico is going to try to use police to to stop this terror\nAnd then of course we have President Trump saying that they're not going to be allowed to come to the United states uh let me just ask you James I mean migrants from Central America this this is not a new development but this this is a huge group does that tell us anything about how this story might be changing [noise]\nYes so uh you're right my migrants from Central American countries like Honduras Guatemala El Salvador had been coming to us for a long time in large numbers but this thing of the caravan\nPete talking to people hear what they say is that this is an opportunity to feel safer on this migrant route so they have plenty of reasons for wanting to flee of violence and poverty and things like that and when they hear a caravan is happening they said this is a really good opportunity for us\nTo not be so exposed on this migrant where that is really dangerous that we can we can be a big group and Jill safer\nUnderlining the difference between the soundbites in what James Frederick just reported from there on the ground I'm the president describes hardened criminals the reporter looking at the people describes a mother with three children a mother with four children are and the complex\nAre you a be eased Johnny Kauffman is here to talk about this he reported the story along with reveal an eight PM reports\nSay they're Johnny hey they're so tell us why this is significant well\nThis is a really close historic race for governor here right now there's lots of national attention on it and it's kind of seen as this sort of test for the twenty twenty presidential contest\nAnd Brian ... is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams\nWho would be the first black female governor and the country and her strategy is all about boosting turnout among people of color right Democrats and civil rights groups say that these voters or they don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans and so they say to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and that\nReally this is a new voter suppression tactic that Republicans are using to help them when is this an issue that\nSeems to be capturing the attention of voters this election gets closer\nYeah this has become a big campaign issue and uh we went to a small town in southwest Georgia called Moultrie um most people there I ... in the town or black or Latino and turnout is really low\nAnd we spoke to this man and Reverend Cornelius ponder who's on the city council there and he says part of that low turnout on is because of all these obstacles devoting including the purchase so here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost give people the non REM mindset that that does is three of ... not right and so now\nAnything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nIs so when it comes to purchase a ponders aunt actually with someone who was removed for not voting\nShe didn't know at her nephew didn't know it and uh her story is kind of that she voted for Obama in two thousand eight\nShe hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting off or Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and and won't be able to vote and Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration unlike some other states now you actually spoke\nTo secretary camp the Republican candidate who actually carried out this policy right I mean what's his argument here\nYet ... says he's just following the law and this is legal the Supreme Court actually approved a policy like this earlier this year\nA on on election day itself and election officials say they're not going to be any uh any results or any of any significance for wake and possibly even for a couple of months\nWhile so we have no idea who won these elections in ... given that they're not even quite over but let me ask about what the winners will face we should note people know from a distance that Afghanistan has had a very powerful president to the extent that it's had a central government at all and of course a lot of decisions\nIn some cases are in the hands or influenced by the United states influenced by allies or for that matter influenced by the Taliban which controls portions of the country will this parliament once it's seated have much to say what were the Robie\nAlso a good question I I\nI think and I and I hope that Congress and hurricane out when I was\nReporting on the campaign interviewing candidates and ... voters I found an enormous amount of uprising or a rock and out of it and that this election actually bring change in parliament itself\nA young people voting young people running

protect occupants or bystanders in some crashes and artificial intelligence could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nA powerful trade and tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers they just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts\nAnd his transparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of this artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for joining us\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general it sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing ... would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and then actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question then some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries they have to actually define them and be aware of them\nAll ethics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics\nAnd it's a reframing of the paradigm that how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what a trip believes about consensus building globally is to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn ... is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems of the eye

Nineteen eighty seven and ratified a year\nLater this all sounds getting out of that treaty pardon me if you if you don't if I can\nI mean this all sounds very impressive this sounds very good but it does lead to a question why would Russia have tested missiles that violated this treaty and I know Russia denies it but it's a little hard for Americans to believe that the Obama administration and the Trump Administration and Britain would all make that up\nWell I'm the one hand I I understand perfectly clear what you're saying on the other hand just as hard for Russians\nTo believe that a that a variety of Obama who very much disliked Mr Putin and ah and President Trump who is not known to be the most um ah how should we pay the truthful person in the world is actually saying the truth it's a way perhaps\nOf getting out of this treaty I Am not in a position\nTo take a stance on that one way or the other I really don't know whether the Russians have tested anything that they shouldn't and when they accuse the United states have also\nAre somehow a not adhering to the treaty I Can't say yes or no to that but it seems to me that when that kind of accusation begins it's basically because\nOne side or the other wants to get out of the treaty how'd you get out of it well the only way to do that just say well the other side and following it so we're going to get out of it and I happen to think it's very dangerous to do that with such an important treaty\nDo you think the president ... mine's getting out of this treaty\nI think he does very much and I believe as we speak a secretary of state ... pay it was here in Moscow meeting with\nA president food in and he will also need with other high ranking officials in this country I think they take it very seriously and I'm hoping that um as a result of that meeting perhaps\nA President Trump will kind of a rethink his statement and that we will preserve the street you\nKnow there isn't an interesting complication here that some U.S officials including the president of the United states has brought up and that is that this is an agreement between the United states and Russia the preeminent nuclear powers in the world\nBut the United states has brought up China which is trying to update its military substantially and it's not a party to that treaty the U.S sees potential danger there does Russia see any potential danger there\nUm you know I Can't speak for Russian leadership at this point and I don't believe anyone's made any official statements but I Do think\nThat we're at the United states and Russia\nOr to demand that China adhere to this treaty or assign um a an additional part of this treaty I think that would be a very good idea and I do think that I'm a new nuclear power in a very big one is we know is\nIndeed um uh an issue for concern and if the United states and Russia were to work together to see to it the China joined the treaties that still exist I think would be a very positive thing for all of us\nIn just a sentence or two is it your instinct to the Russian officials would be willing to change this treaty in some way in order to preserve it if that would satisfy the United states\nWell I think it's always a compromise both sides have to say OK let's compromise on this I think there's a will to do this on both sides it can be done\nOkay let me pose near the Russian journalist thanks very much really appreciate it\nThank you thank you\nIt's been about a year since the publication of sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein team this\nInspired thousands of women to report their own experiences of sexual harassment but in India a country with high rates of sexual violence against women there was no such me too movement that is until now NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from India\nThere is ago when a famous Indian film star tan is Sheree Dakota complained of sexual harassment by a prominent male actor this is\nWhat she faced trying to leave the set of the film they'd been shooting together an angry mob\nSurrounded her car smashing windshields ... filmed it she was replaced by another actress she felt like no one believed her she says\nThere was no need to move and I don't even think we discuss things like sexual harassment looks sort of went in India they made it a scandal like I I felt like it was nothing my head against the wall\nThat had decided to take a break from the Indian film industry Bollywood she moved to the U. S. and watched Hollywood actresses speak out about abuse by the U.S film producer Harvey\nWeinstein what I saw was a self defense from what I Would see in India the women didn't have a sense of shame and stigma attached to them like in India if somebody has to stand up and speak about harassment abuse assault or you can almost feel the awkwardness last month to return\nTo India on vacation and spoke to local media about that contrast of being ignored when she tried to report harassment here ten years ago and then watching women in the U.
