I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC a group of migrants is still weeks away from the U.S border and moving slowly through Mexico\nBut within days President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand us troops to the border at rallies for Republican candidates this fall the president has explicitly port the distant caravan at the center of the election campaigns and elections seemed to be continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that and we're enjoy loaded up with the cable that's called an invasion of our country for president\nWas apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states\nWith that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first if it is getting near the U.S [noise] no\nNot at all it's still a probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap wanna which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around uh the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined and size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself\n... nobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily\nMirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is based because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves had a they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly one which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was still both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there is no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably moved their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were ... were wanting to work in northern Mexico reporter David Ira and thanks so much you're very welcome\n[noise] basic\nServices for

do whatever we need to do to help everybody get through this\nRabbi checked diamond who once led a congregation that tree of life says rabbis had been going to the more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guard some would be with them while they're there they pray the sea salts and so it was just somebody should pass from the world by themselves it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says a ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's where we celebrate and it's a great commandment of great concern that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in

worship\nFirst thing I Would see it I always say see so you're going to chase everybody away that's why nobody's here because you're sitting there you know he would have some resort to me and we would

this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction either well there's rabbit so what's a good example of how this were a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men of the you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up a ... on the darkest a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion now I mean of course the president would\nSay sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a mess was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the mean enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House\nYeah I I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to have part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains incentive for the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their\nI I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up an apple buying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies but you know they've been very reluctant to that\nAnd understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are\nAiring more on the side of uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past are we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and die and even before that a but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington

only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations well accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money into your are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for a pillow see for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody ...\nI asked golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance

interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that is still legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be a citizen\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional and then but then you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number ... into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end\nA NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next morning Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are a week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this is just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over\nA there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of paper where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking about all that sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious\n... that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying um\nYou need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try and scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right

spending and I'm the first one to point the finger is that Republicans for that and Democrats\nYou know historically as looking at this thing from Goldman Sachs a chart showing that except for the Korean and Vietnam wars low unemployment like we have now often is associated goes hand in hand with lower deficits but now we have lower unemployment but the deficit is going on\nLet me ask you a question and your listeners the question would you rather have a lower budget deficit right now and less economic growth and fewer jobs or would you rather have a higher budget deficit and a lot more jobs and a lot more growth\nI fall into the latter category or maybe some of my conservative friends don't I Know where Donald Trump falls on this Donald Trump believes that the number one priority is to get the economy moving again\nSo I mean when you step back from this though is the Trump Administration everything you'd hoped for when you through in your life with Donald Trump during the campaign is it that way okay and\nAll that look I mean the proof the putting us in the eating we've got the strongest economy in Thirty years and I took it took the tax cuts and getting the government off of the backs of business\nOn the tax cuts I mean there's certainly cheered up the stock market but I just saw before he came in a new survey from the national association for business economics and this is what they asked\nHas your from adjusted plans were hiring or investments as a result of the tax cutting job act a majority said no eighty one percent said no we haven't changed the amount of hiring or investment\nThat most where are you now that I share that info our biggest goal in this tax cut was to get businesses to invest in America\nWe saw big boost in consumer spending in the last GDP report and I look at that they say how can people say middle class isn't doing better they feel like they've got more money in their pocket if they're going out and spending\nStephen Moore co

Washington\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California so how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in the Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts\nGab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gained traction\nEither well there's rabbit so what's a good example of how this for a short so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras\nOr this is a the idea that this was some big men is that you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the ... the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind it and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you you are saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the mean enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of their work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House\nYeah I I I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his fire the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press than not these things down should fall to social media platforms to to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in and understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has always been going I mean it seems like something that is really accelerated\nObviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and ... even before that a but it is really accelerated with social media and also I think uh the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning and studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics
