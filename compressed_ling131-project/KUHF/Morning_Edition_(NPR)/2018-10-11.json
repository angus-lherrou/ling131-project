intelligence personnel who flew in and flew out of turkey within a few hours ... low in is a correspondent in Turkey the claim also from security officials markers that this was all to the highest level of the Saudi Arabian government [noise]\nYeah there's a lot of speculation about this at the moment on um rumors that a ... an operation was ordered from the by the Saudi crown prince to your ... back to Saudi Arabia remember he'd been living in exile sets a self imposed exile in the U.S\nFor the past year and a half or so\nUm he had become pretty strident critic of the of the crown prince end of the ... down on dissent in Saudi Arabia and on other issues for example Saudi Arabia's involvement in the war in neighboring Yemen\nThere are reports in the Washington Post today from\nUnnamed American intelligence officers saying that they had a intercepted communications and and attempts by the Saudi Government to do and Mr casualty back to Saudi Arabia but that the Saudi critic I realized that was a trap 'em and I felt that he would be in danger by doing that\nUm the suggestion that uh the idea that the use of the operation was was pet plan to take him to the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul\nDetain him and and removed from Saudi Arabia I thought that it might have gone wrong now have to say the U.S State Department has the night that they had any prior warning of any threat to miss a casual tree or any attempt to you and back\nUp partly I suppose because if they had received a a a warning or or or any kind of a threat to him they would it be obliged to pass that on which the which they clearly didn't do\nThis puts Russia ... one in a difficult position because she needs the cooperation with the Saudis and various sectors that affect Turkish foreign policy

to the pro government media hair\nNaming the Fifteen Saudis who move who came to assemble lost a ... a week ago now who was thought to be hit squad it might have killed in a psychiatric tree\nUm uh we we all given that were given the information about uh how we think the killing happened but the president's head wants to be much more cautious you simply saying he's concerned he wants the Saudis part to provide video evidence to back up that claim that nothing happened\nAnd I think that the reason he's doing that is because he's trying to present the relationship\nAnd if he was echoed those very incriminating allegations turkey will be obliged to kick out the Saudi ambassador consul general by now so I think that just to add one is giving Saudi Arabia little bit more time a little bit of

those are the top stories this is the b._b._c. [noise]\n\n[noise] this is an Damon in London it's what's being called ... week for Britain's prime minister Theresa May because breakfast\nAnd they go she Asians are not only on going about ah getting increasingly difficult to help us understand some of this is Rob Watson optical correspondent\nA and in particular one group of the members of parliament that she lives on the reason may relies on is the the UP they off from northern islands are and they're very unhappy with the way things seem to be\nGoing they are I mean to get to the big picture for ... in many ways that people have listened for wildlife it's changed in the sense that the reason they are still ... and the horrible fix hell week it's been held ... how I don't know how decade for ever since he became in charge\nOf the problem is essentially this how'd you get a deal about Britain's future relationship with the European Union ...\nCan be sold a divided governing conservative policy\nSo the other members of the European Union has staying in the ... and yes the partner of us at the Democratic union U.S policy which is a a a large Protestant posse and Northern Ireland which believes very much in the United kingdom why is there a problem\nBecause with Britain leaving the European Union guess ... ... and just going to leave the European Union but the Irish republican staying in it and so\nThere are all sorts of questions is how do you avoid to several months to a hard border between north and on and on the Irish republican essentially that the pay this Protestant policy\nWho helped keep threes and manpower say you can't do anything but somehow makes ...\nLeft as much as I said about capital it it takes about animals isn't it because the island is an island okay part of it is part of the United kingdom the north but if you send the animals either way across that see then you are putting them in a territory where they might go into the European Union the European Union\nHas its standards on animal health yeah and it wants to ensure that those were maintenance so Michele ... negotiators said last night\nAt the moment will have to we have a ten percent of\nAnimals checking them it'll have to be a hundred percent because they might get into the ... you and that seems very clear\nI absolutely ... unless those you might say if people can't say they want warm I mean there are a main campaign said that might be a horrible problem if Britain votes to leave the European Union and the Northern Ireland would constitute the border between\nUh the United kingdom and the European Union it would be an ... an absolutely if you're in a different regulation regular tree regime you have different customs juices\nHow would you avoid the for the you know in the way down to the real issue here I mean yes it's about Catholic but of course in the end it's about politics and about people an ancient problem\nAnd you have to explain that the the the reason why everyone so anxious to avoid having a ... between the two is because if it was hot infrastructure it could be a target for mainly Catholic national\nLeader of the do you pay the union is to saying we don't want those ... says actually you're giving into the big states you're giving into a Republican militants because you are afraid if you set up a bowl to they will attack it\n[noise] ... yes but on the other hand parts of the peace agreements in Northern Ireland suggests that that should be no ... I mean that was passed the trick one of the things that go Catholics in all of a lot and so except that the north would remain in the u._k. was to make it incredibly easy to go backwards and forwards\nWhat sort of damage has been doing\nSo as far as Georgia because we're seeing widespread power outages over two hundred thousand people in Georgia are without power this morning\nA number of trees down a large of trees pine trees a widespread damage across Syria nothing as a catastrophic is what they saw in the panhandle of Florida but still a lot of outages a lot of trees down\nWas there an evacuation cooled or did some people go anywhere\nUm there was never an evacuation called Georgia as far as the Georgia coast goes uh we did a tropical storm warnings stretching from savannah Brunswick but the surgeon Georgia was\nNever expected to be life threatening I never got to be life threatening so there was no mandatory evacuations\nAnd really the only people I wouldn't say evacuated but people that live in a bowl of trailers or they were finding different places to stay for the night because we did have that tornado threat or that lasted through the overnight hours\nWe heard from a major all these here that the the storm the harder it landed on the panhandle of Florida actually picked up speed overland for a while now that's unusual isn't it\nYeah it's very unusual so usually with these tropical systems um their war or low heat off very warm ocean water so as soon as they move over land they usually we can substantially a fairly quickly so to see it again that little bit of speeding strength right away and fall it is on you\nAnd we're not going to do the climate change question because I think it's widely accepted no ah that that's something that has to be taken into account\nBut actually the ... the ... the ... the waters excuse me while they were more than an unusually warm at the moment\nRight yeah that's exactly right so the Gulf of Mexico is just naturally stays warm a year round and as far as hurricanes to grow or tropical system to grow these usually wars are between eighty four degrees Fahrenheit\nSo uh the water was warm it's not unusual for this war and this time of year is just one of those things are with the peak of hurricane season now that we're kind of drop and also we're still in hurricane season in tropical systems do develop\nRather digital too thanks so much indeed for your help around the hail who's from WROL DWI news in August ... in Georgia I BBC done David on Twitter if you wanted to tell us your own heart broken story I guess you might be listening having show to true it's a let us know how you got on a BBC done to him and if you use Twitter\nFor messaging the medical charity ... he is calling for an immediate end to Australia's offshore Center for asylum seekers and refugees on the island of no new\nNGOs of express concerns over the humanitarian conditions in that island and the guessing on an idea of once it's been like the I've been speaking to the psychiatrist dumped about the ... she's from him assessments and cell phones yeah Australia she was one of the dumps is providing treatment on motives\nWere making with ... and ... and the science tickets\nAnd add the with significant and mental health issues in the skirts and ... then I ruined population or ... patients with chronic psychotic illnesses and mainly with the refugees and asylum seekers I leave the treatment people mainly with depression anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder\nAnd associated with that we would think significant needles ... suicidal ... and ...\nAnd we always say thing the same conditions and children of refugees and asylum seekers and we think children as young as nine years old who were making ... thoughts and making suicide attain\nTell us more about the children how did this stress present itself how did the damage\nTo the children I presented with symptoms of depression and anxiety\nAh that real estate I saw children that ... with the condition that we're referring to is traumatic was ... trying to these uh with children and I was there for quite some time on the island and so I knew quite a few of these children and they would stop and chat to me in the states will men\nAnd what I saw was that these children need to house declined and I was in the last year and they became a priest\nSays to socially withdraw and then when I went to save and and I had the Hines at these children had taken to the advantage and when not eating or drinking sufficient amounts to keep and sounds in my eyes I some of these children were unable to even walk to the toilets\nTheir incontinent of urine and feces and they stopped talking to us and they were children that I knew and when you when they looked towards you they would just suck right through you like you were in the air\nAnd these children and ultimately I needed to be had medical evacuations two stray yeah and I cry it's nice to gastric feeding\nThe government of Australia says that he has a contract to health professionals including thirty three mental health professionals to provide services on no new or the implication is that that's enough they say they take the role as soon as they won't do\nSo much at our experiences on the island and it was not enough and we had ... sufficient to non ...\nCents at the time as they think that we had nearly a hundred Irish DJ's and asylum seekers on our wasting is at the clinic and what we found\nWas that I'll send it to be she Jason assignments because didn't trust the services contract says by the U.S China incontinent\nAnd ending to house it's really important for people to be able to trust the clinicians that that working less and they felt unable to trust these conditions because they were contacted by these tiny\nMeant and that these shining gotten into ocean any is determining the immigration passed we with the ... independent organization on the island and people appreciate is having a service and that was not contracted by ...\nWhat was the reason given to you by the government of no rule that you should leave\nThe government is not re I Will not specific about the reason\nHow did they enforce that to leave\nThey risk true memorandum of understanding which was added agreements\nThat as we could provide need to house scare and that was applied for not ruins the refugees and asylum seekers an apt discrimination I think they ... that was and they document that was provided to us with that ... with no longer required\nCause a lot of people in Australia votes for the policy that exists they may have some sympathy with individual children all those who are suffering but overall it seems Australian voters want asylum seekers not be allowed to land on Australia's mainland\n... we are asking as for the media evacuation of all let's find seekers and refugees from the island the asylum seekers and refugees that we are asking\nTo be that you liked it had old thing I'm not really for five years there I Know new race DJ's or asylum seekers arriving they hit thing that the same people that had been there\nFor the last five years and discourage people that are ... teams in that way yeah asking at the image to types of safety risk taking the fight conditions to complete the race ...\nAnd that does not involve ... of course because it wouldn't be practical that they go back to where they came from\nWe talking about ... case and these people and that and the international law what a ... eight so it's not safe to these people to return to the hunt catchy\nTitle to better corner of MSN if Australia I babysit and they've been on Twitter if you want to comment you're listening to well to update [noise]\nWhat happens to

really but this is about black holes having seats which means he dissipates black holes might disappear what happens to the objects\nAnd that's exactly what it said that we're trying to find a resolution to this problem and all the information powder which is something that Stephen Hawking has been\nUm really obsessed with the last forty years we'll say on this problem is essentially as you said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole where does the information about these objects\nAnd usually we think that from the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and they want something flew into a black hole who intimation about it pays me last forever and what we've been trying to do is to um traces information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you\nWell we're not definitely not that we we we want to step forward I'd say we've shown that I'm so there's a way of describing all these ... in a black hole and

voice you heard there was that our our ... she's an evolutionary biologist and presenter of the documentary budget called what makes us tick and I asked other when did you first realize that her subject I'll do was beginning to unravel\nFrom the beginning you could see a shift um and it's cumulative right to every single day he was shifting say the the big thing that we were saying was that he was shifting about half an hour out\nEvery single day so um he would wake up half an hour to every single day\nNot because he has an accurate but he took ... actually most of us have inaccurate body talks and most of us have a buddy ... long since I've been being twenty four hours that twenty four and a half hours um and\nWe need light to reset them it's like one of those old will end up talks um and if you're not getting that light you're not getting the reset so he wasn't getting that reset every single day and so he was shifting late at night to night to every single day\nTo begin with you had some light and then she took away the light\nSo he had U.S officials down they asked that he could control and\nThen we took it off him and we we we basically did something called going dating or what we called ... which means that we switched off the lights twenty four seven the only thing he had was a constant a ... in the corner and that was on constantly twenty four hours a day again\nAnd that was the point where I really started to see and struggling\nTo do you have anything to do because having nothing to do would also add to that yeah last so timely and\nSay oh they are really really tough guy and he's a former Monday and one of the things he loves doing is working out um so we gave him a\nYou know he's Jim ... down that but we also gave him activities to do a seven times a day and not with all benefit for the scientists benefit to see how his um physical strength flaws but also how he was protesting things and you could see the decline of that three time but I\nKind of go back to the gym kit that he had he wasn't enjoying working out anymore which was really unusual for him and say you go to see the deterioration of muddy and within that you get a really good idea of just how important oh buddy cop thought was and how it's important to understand the impact of them on a house\nOn the importance of light yes yes say this is so crucial we evolved in a time where\nAre you would be outside a lot that definitely when you didn't deal with it is and that you know and and you need to be getting outside you need to find ways of going outside to get natural sunlight and\nThe other part of it in the in the evening instead of just staying awake by candlelight too by fire which has brought me a full full instead when we've got all these funds is called these getting really bright artificial light and that is not good for as\nAnybody could all do change going to be tough you know what I mean it's just that kind of name isn't it could it could be a negative for the um but he suffered\nPut it like Best Buy day nine I was really happy that we would get to come out with that because it's it's actually really uncomfortable towards somebody full now yeah it's not fun it's fun and you know it's most people were in that they would have they would have given up much much quicker you know he's an adventure ... he's a tough guy\nWhat did we learn for the rest of us who are not going to spend time in a bunk bunker with no light\nIt is extreme the truth is almost knives are extreme we did not vote for this about he talks and not getting the reason that they need to ... we should be taking away is\nHow do we need more in sync\nWith ...

election and twenty twenty\nBut Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power when Republicans

president but the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's

David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist Jim ...\nHe entered the Saudi conflict in ... turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country\nSaudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us ... thanks for having me\nYour reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh yeah so as you say the U.S is gathered intelligence\nThat showed that the crown prince ordered this operation to lure him from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears to confirm\nThat the Saudi leadership at the highest levels was seeking asylum and ah he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the\nIntelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions 'em and they and they really add to the drawing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in ... his disappear into that conflict could in some way be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nThat conflict there is that there is\nThis theory that that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nPlan to capture him that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have that triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but ... how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks at the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn Jemma how about the details of the far\nThat they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up as this potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we cannot let this happen\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he was a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program\n...\nThe president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is ...\nTrump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the us presidents do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closer or both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage this relationship because that's one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him\nTo allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying that would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President ... in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies cause what brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs this a government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that this uprising in some way\n[noise] um it it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of this job um he was defending a lot of his friends who are opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be\nA a real problem for the Saudis the Saudis over reacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nIn the rich Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi\nRelationship from being extremely strong and again I just point you to North Korea I mean Trump expressing his love for Kim Jong il and who is by far the most criminal

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel\nMartin in Washington DC and I'm David Greene in Culver City California so it could really be happening could've Brexit deal will be on the horizon the European Union breakfast negotiator says with good will on both sides in agreement on Britain's departure from the European Union is quote within reach and this comes ahead of a very important summit in Brussels next week\nLots of Newman Linda Grant is a former diplomat who worked on the ... for both Finland and ... and Brussels joins me on Skype right now the morning or\nGood morning so is this for real I Know we've heard that the two sides have been close to something and and the ... of of kind of falling apart what makes this moment feel different if at all\nUh I think it is for ... and one other thing is that makes a difference of course at the time it's getting very and I have no choice there is no choice to get a deal at all the deal is also the prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there's no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think at both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then what is the deadline thing the deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to ratify the deal in all twenty seven even parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament and you have to translate it and process it so\nYou would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull for\nUs to travel to like two dozen different languages we actually so I could be taking a lot of time okay you're going to say there's a second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken you case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be an although the checkers deal is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward so a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something\nConcrete exactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and\nHow recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the so called Good Friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the few so if you think about free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want\nAt all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area\nAnd they are about you know when when when and if Northern Ireland is leaving\nAt there is a real risk as to what is happening underground and they can that can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict locally\nAnd and and one more question we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and and the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote would you take Britain back\nYou is I mean the u._k. is still a member of the new but it's not an essay member state that it was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during this recession\nA lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but it's

favors\nMenendez escaped legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit and it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection

people needed drug\nCharge\nCuban is running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage he is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to

fact to recent polls show Menendez and the lead\nBut two other public polls have Menendez and you get in a dead heat confirming what some Democrats had feared that Menendez is corruption trial even though it didn't end in a conviction is turning off voters\nBend working runs the ...

more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist Jim all the Shelby\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since because he wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S the post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country\nSaudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us again thanks for having me\nYour reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia um\nWhy were they trying to get him back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so ... as you say that the U.S has gathered intelligence that showed that the crown\nPrince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership is the highest levels was seeking asylum juvenile uh he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis and said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and that they are now worried about the safety of\nThe intelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions 'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappearance at that conflict could in some way be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised that possibility or you know ... there's there's been very little hard evidence about what\nThat conflict there is that there is this theory\nThat that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nPlan to capture that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find that out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks is that the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of this has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty\nTo warn jump how about the details of the ...\nAh that they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nGregory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president's speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can have\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he was a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program ... so\nThe president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump is ... and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the us presidents do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel a disclosure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him\nTo allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President Bush in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore I'm\nLooking at you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies cause what brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course has the ability\nOf the Senate and others to constrain Trump\nWell an Arab climate change and wetter storms and more intense rainfall we ought to be thinking bigger we ought to be thinking about um regulating an incentivizing and purchasing a an

period\nSo if there is no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then the deadline thing that deadline I mean breakfast is

you know a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these

we actually got this so called check his proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see themselves leaving and

New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station WHYY reports\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will

Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew jersian [noise] gave me the benefit of that [noise] I think\nDepartment prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors Menendez survived legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like these started appear al Mendez\nObama Justice department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper gifts and campaign contributions\nNew Jersey deserves\nThat ad comes from and then there's his opponent Republican Bob ... a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign\n... is a

and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump and twenty sixteen\nIn a state where no Republican has been elected to the Senate since Nineteen Seventy two you might think you can support for Trump would tank his chances of victory\nIn fact to recent polls show Menendez in the lead but two other public polls have Menendez and you get in a dead heat confirming with some Democrats had feared that Menendez is corruption trial even though it didn't end in a conviction is turning off voters\nBeen working runs Rowan Institute for public policy and citizenship\nIf you're watching these ads you think Bob and that this was convicted and for some reason it's not in jail\nThe question is which Bob Menendez democratic voters will be thinking about when they show up to the polls the one who's
