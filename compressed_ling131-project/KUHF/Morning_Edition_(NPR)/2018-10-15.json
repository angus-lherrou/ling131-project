very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it ended that denied the mentally\nCould it be them yes\nThought when asked about whether he'd consider sanctions against the

wanted it China wanted it we wanted it we got it and we had all of it every bit of its own would you cut that on why well All right what I don't want to do\nI don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order like that and you know there are other ways of a how to use a word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\n[noise] although the miles is a former British diplomat he worked in Saudi Arabia and now he's editor of Arab digest and use that for those doing business with the Arab region so it was his reaction to Donald Trump basing his judgment on orders from military equipment\nWell that's a pity because I think the main thing that we want to try to change a as a result of all this is support for Saudi Arabia is war in Yemen\nBecause Saudi Arabia is has a prime responsibility not so responsibility for prime responsibility for the biggest a humanitarian disaster in the world according to some people right now with millions of people in the point of salmon\nAnd uh the international community has failed to to deter um Saudi Saudi Arabia to challenge from carrying out this very destructive a campaign\nWhich which of course a large number of civilian deaths directly quite apart from the wider implications that could change now and I think but to live President Trump said well he said\nCongress may think differently Congress ... there were signs that Congress is Gary itself up to take a strong line on the question of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and I use in Yemen\nThe Saudi Arabian response so far is basically we don't care what would change that\nBut I think that uh if if we went to ... supplying we and the Americans were supplying weapons to uh to Saudi Arabia unstructured vying military support from the um munitions and so on and on technical advice\nUm ... well for the Saudis to say as they have said we could talk to the Russians the Chinese and tell him but meanwhile all over the period of months or years when they wouldn't be able to carry out the war in Yemen\nAnd they could turn the old weapon on the west coast indicted raising all prices wouldn't be hawk\nYes they could do that they could do as they did a village in Seventy is huge the oil weapons so cold but the only weapon is a double edged weapon notes we got Saudi Arabia relies on oil just as much as we do\nDo you think this will although it's horrible in its detail in the end be smoothed over about time we'll put it at a distance and relations will go back to what they were because Saudi Arabia is so important in the region and so important with it's available funds well\nMy first thought was that that would be the case but I'm a material interests towards Trump any any um\nAny moral indignation of Trump what's happening but so far that hasn't happened than we've seen

September two thousand and that teen and not the significance because that's the date that Syria was had had meant to and declare and destroy all of that chemical weapons\nAnd I'm a hundred and sixty four what we did as we used evidence by Nineteen impartial organizations and we cross checked oldest evidence\nAnd what we could find that with strong evidence to say a chemical attack has happened we lifted that attack and when so and the and we found a hundred and six attacks of we feel very confident they did take place\nAnd what was the evidence was it video evidence was it an actual analysis of soil samples that kind of thing\nIt varied depending on the organization but most of it yes is either visual evidence eyewitness testimony something that had been taken from the ground and also um analysis of the ... some of the victims showed that who are that in the area at the time that attack happens\n... says it's a false that's what he says this is all just nonsense\nAnd that's exactly why this investigation was so important I mean some of the different the nation and fake news that has come out of you know stories like this has made people cost out or what was going on in Syria and so that's what we felt it was so important to use the evidence that is available\nTo kind of try and prove and what is actually going on and how many chemical attacks that have happened you know the Syrian Government has made the incredibly difficult for mechanisms like the OPEC W and the joint investigative mechanism that has the mandate from the UN to investigate these sorts of attacks to do that job\nAnd so we thought it was very important to highlight the extent of the situation and what was going on\nAnd the obesity W that is the un watchdog for chemical weapons to prevent use of chemical weapons what are we talking about in terms of chemicals all these things like chlorine which will readily available or are we talking about much more complex chemical weapons and a nerve agent so\nWhat we saw was actually the ... and two of the attacks the cell phone must it and these attacks have already been proven to be done by ice and that so called Islamic state\nSeventy nine attacks look chlorine and this was really important because it also helps us kind of understand the strategy behind why these chemical weapons were used in ... and very happy ... chemical it sinks deep underground and it was a strategic to use chlorine because\nYou know many people had sheltered deep underground from the conventional bombing and so when they hit with chlorine there were forced to come out of the underground shelters that they were hiding in and that's one of the main reasons that people ended up fleeing after these attacks took place\nAnd we also saw some sign attacks one of the sign attacks was the one in ... which was reported widely that killed over eighty people and and that sign attack was the last sign attack it was also proven that the government was responsible for this attack because the sign use was from the same stockpile\nDots and OPEC W was meant to have destroyed in two thousand at that team\nHow do you identify that to the sea they investigate the precursor chemicals that we used to make their salary and and they found that one of the class of chemicals matched exactly the same sort of chemical that they found and the shuttle assets possession in two thousand and that\nThis is clearly an affront to international law it's ignoring the demands that have been made in the past the so called red lines that have been drawn do you suppose that the evidence you're presenting will change much\nI think there has been a lot of evidence pictures before that has been very bold and very evident that the shuttle left that has been using chemical weapons time and time again and yet the international community hasn't really reacted and and I I don't see that they will react anytime soon now\nNow while I'm a ... few hoped with that investigation on the BBC ... program which will be available on line this is wild update [noise]\nBritish Government sources of told the BBC Brexit negotiations of hip to quote a real real problem over the issue of the Northern Ireland border it's understood central further reassurances being sought by ... you know whatever the so called Northern Ireland backstop an arrangement to be put into place to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland\nAnd Ireland in the event that there is no trade agreement reached between the u._k. and the ... speaking to the BBC Ireland's ambassador to the u._k. Adrian O'Neill long time is running out\nIf it's a ... weeks and European Council leasing there isn't some way forward within I think we've probably see people you know who decide to evade of opportunity as you say for the November mission to focus on preparations for for no do you do come but I mean I don't think we're there yet and I mean I think there's still a lot of a negotiation to be done\n[noise] what robots or not but it's a correspondent this year ... Smith excuse me joined us or Europe editor of the Irish Times in Brussels Patrick um they were supposed as the ambassador mentioned to be a stomach while the summit will go ... go ahead on Wednesday\nBut that was supposed to be an opportunity for decision to be reached ... we're not there yet as the ambassador says what we're all we\nWere ... Ninety nine percent withdrawal agreement is agreed with the most difficult bears are still not agreed amount relates as you said the buck stops in in\nAh in relation to the new ones to guarantees that Britain will continue to do whatever come and whatever it needs to to ensure the or the friction was borders maintained on the island of our\nUm the deal appears to have broken down on the moms by the u._k. that the buck stops a guaranteed would be time\nMuch of that um that is a very difficult proposition for you I'm a ... a because they say that ah it's it's not worth anything if it if it's time limited\nUh and they are convinced that the problem arises because the u._k. is worried\nThat ah it will not be able to do in the long term an agreement with the the emu that provides the safeguards necessary uh for the continued maintenance divergence border in which stage if if the\nBackstop byzantine limited they will be tied in to a customs union uh for for for good if if if necessary so it's a it's a very serious problem\nAnd there are lots of things in this but just to simplify it at least in my mind I I think about capital because I ... Ireland is an islands Northern Ireland just bought the u._k. but it's on an island which means that the Senate tree conditions in order to move livestock around have to be present preventive I have to be protected\nAnd that's why there needs to be some kind of a checking a it was before those capital I'll put onto onto boats\n'em robots and Boris Johnson who used to be the foreign sec they're not very long ago talking about Ireland uh he says that if any deal that he wants to agree to\nA it will be the annexation of an old an island by a foreign power not bearing in mind what some people think who's annexing Walt ... that's very provocative isn't it how how loud is his voice that\nIt is loud amongst people who are enthusiastic supporters of Brexit I mean I think more so by analysts of what he's been saying what's what what students themselves are you kidding see one of us would want to add ... and the idea that Brussels\nWas somehow one's a ... a bit of a bit of Northern Ireland and with all of the troubles that go with ... and that sort of\nYes it's a piece for the massive amounts of healing you know you can go on but I think it's indicative of something a little more difficult for threes and man for this whole process and that is\nShe is trying to get at a at a deal Patrick has given me some of the details of the problem with all of a lot of just trying to get a deal which somehow it feels to ... minutes they divided policy the conservatives someone's a closer relationship some more distant like Boris Johnson\nAnd the European Union she's essentially trying to square the circle she's trying to leave the European Union without any of the negative impacts so let's see what we're saying now with this issue with ... but it's about other things it's a matter of fact ... industry is the difficulty of squaring that circle\n[noise] and it was that in mind Patrick how do you see the idea of a November special summit which again was to be agreed if there was a deal in the making ... how did you see that prospect\nI think from soldiers diplomats here last night uh they're definitely will be in November So much uh they uh they're disappointed that the that it's not going to be discussing a a deal concluded in October but they are saying the talks will resume after this current some talk to some of this week\nUh and they expect it to be something for for November to to to discuss\nUh and as as uh you said earlier if if there isn't then they will be discussing new deal arrangements and on what happens when the end of march comes in Britain leaves with our transition\nTo pick up on what Patrick saying it's a throwback I'd had a ... you know that is the big question will Britain leave the European Union without to do at the one hand most people think that's completely crazy if you look at the economic consequences for Britain they are truly truly grim not great for you but truly truly grim for Britain\nAre increasingly I think so um the biggest bloc is a American resistance um North Korea or South Korea is constrained from doing a lot of stuff because of sanctions on North Korea now the ... South Korean stop and think that the sanctions can be sort of finesse a little bit in the interest that they can't and it's really the Americans more than anywhere else that stand behind them the Americans are close allies South Korea\nSo my sense of the south Koreans are pushing hard on that at the American to depend on this and will probably happen\n[noise] what would the traffic the because export sanctioned\nYeah that's actually part of the big question right I wondering myself I mean is this just sort of a chauffeur sort of the current purposes just to kind of like symbolized unification now you could conceivably take a train from Seoul John Young or something like that but\nThen the question of course who would actually do that would would any North Koreans at all be permitted to do that um that would be amazing right because then you probably get a lot of people fleeing the country on what anybody in in South Korea want to do that with South Koreans have rights in North Korea I mean this is\nYou know the the ... the moon government that South Korean president moon government hasn't actually provided a lot of detail about that so it's not clear at this is going to be like tourism or or or um [noise] our commercial exchange or whatever um because North Korea of course there's really export very much\nA buddy this positive that effort by ... billion and his advisors to indicate that North Korea is going in the right direction they keep saying that they will denuclearize how confident are you [noise]\nOf denuclearization I Will be surprised if they go all the whole way um my guess is that um we can probably get a freeze where they are and maybe a rollback of ten to twenty percent of the program at best but the north Koreans worked on this for fifty years I mean they they've been thinking about nuclear weapons since the sixties\nAnd um it would be amazing after all the trouble they went through all the sanctions in isolation and you know to sort of dislocation from the world economy right you know and everything else that the north Koreans were all the sacrifices that they would give all it up\nFor um American security guarantees which you know a middling value right in the Trump administration's just walked away from the Iran deal we we cheated on a nuclear deal with Gadhafi and then killed by the Arab Spring revolutionaries so it's not really clear the Americans have a whole lot in ... what we believe in if we offered to\nI'd be glad to be on that first train that wouldn't you [laughter]\nYeah it would actually be pretty fascinating right by me and like what are they going to do or that's the question like what are they going to trade and we just darker export anything not really I I don't know I don't know what's going to do with it\nPrevents Kelly thank you Robin Kelly from Tucson National University in South Korea royal baby news Nicholas which will joins is who's don't cut off your royal baby is over the

industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper still and we met Eric Gregory of the

voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital\nThat Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now as prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week\nWas time running out there is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning Steve how has this story evolving what's\nThat going very well you know ah basically there were talks over the weekend I'm Dominic ... he's the breakfast secretary he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to prime minister may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the ... for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks\nAre a stalemate us so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing the this frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult\nProblem to solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans a realtor eager to grab onto\nNo they're not and actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom as he was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say are they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell or their breakfasts years then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch their our breakfast\nYears who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said in the past\nUh no no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly to the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens to the next day\nWell now we have to see it she'll even fly to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if there haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering in kind of center on her way you're not going to risk that again [noise]\nSo where does stalemate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union of and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts\nHappy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country you have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line offer President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is that just to stay in\nPower but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports if Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation\nOn the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLook it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to infect the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect their willingness for some who are good at it for a long time like the ... and whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval because he's at eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nIt's falling forty two on MORNING EDITION on your NPR station Houston Public media news

they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's

country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper

would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital\nThe Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now as prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week\nWas time running out there is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning Steve how has this story evolving\nWhat's that going very well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend of Dominic Rob these the breakfast after he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the prime minister may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across a Ireland the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concerns that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or still made\nUs so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult problem to solve\nAll though you also noted that even that proposal is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not and actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom as it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch their our breakfast\nYears who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said in the past\nUh no no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk of there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens to the next day well\nNow we have to see if she'll even fly to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if there haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way you're not going to risk that again [noise]\nSo where does stalemate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union um and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts\nHappy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country and a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line well for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is that just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirmed judges take another whacking Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress up President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to her again sets the agenda and get bills across for\nThat will greatly affect the rolling those for some who had been at it for a long time and like the ... and ... maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good\nFor Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval cause she's at eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nSeven forty two on MORNING EDITION on your NPR station Houston Public media news eighty

marketplaces senior economics contributor Chris feral\nYou're good morning to you good morning David what do we learn about the state of the economy when we see these housing numbers turn a little bit south\nLet me just give you a couple of quick readings you know the Case Shiller index is is the main home price index has followed by Wall Street home prices are rising less than expected number existing home sales that's declined\nThe exchange traded fund that attracts home building industry it's down by almost twenty two percent this year so it's not that surprising that the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac\nThey came out and they predicted that home sales are going to decline this year\nAnd this is what our central bankers are engineering they're raising interest rates to tap the brakes on a little bit near the brakes coming\nRight we have mortgage rates are nearing five percent so to one extent you would say okay this is the pause that that refreshes and the central bank is kind of raising these rates for the overall good of the economy but here's the question David and this is a question that's going around Wall Street a lot more these days\nWe have a strong economy and typically in a strong economy housing market stay strong so is this weakness in the housing market signaling something bigger about the overall economy and less about the fed raising interest rates\nOr can be signaling something about us we consumers of I mean many of us have debt and maybe we can't take on more debt we've\nBeen taking on a lot of auto loans we've been taking a lot of credit cards\nStudent loan debt is now one point five trillion dollars so that means student loans are now the second largest component of household debt after mortgages I mean that's really a striking figure so that's one half of what I think this decline in home prices is telling us people got a lot of debt right now\nAll right so dead but what's the other half of the equation as you see it as\nWell it's low income growth and I think what we're seeing in the housing market is that investors are recognizing that the gains in the housing market has simply out ran the income growth and\nInvestors are sort of saying I don't think it's going to change that much I think what this what's happening in the home market is telling us is that wages are going to stay low income growth is going to stay low they're going to improve but it's not going to be great that the signal from the housing market\nMarketplaces senior economics contributed ... and St Paul Chris thank you thanks a
