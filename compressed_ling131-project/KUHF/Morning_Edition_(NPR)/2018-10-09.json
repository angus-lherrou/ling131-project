World Service we live in London I'm James ... world update now there's no shortage of Sullivan\nThese politicians ready to lend a supporter campaigns protecting threatened wildlife such as elephants and tigers and plenty of public support them for money too but what about those on the front line of carrying out that works the wildlife range is charged with protecting the animals from purchase\nOn a new report by the environmental group WWF suggest conditions for those ranges oh five\nExcept for high rates of illness in my training and even basic equipment and we'd be in the studio a WWF for his seeing there's been a leading this research welcome to the program tell us a bit more about those conditions I mean they're pretty worked for which will can sometimes range is not even having ... boots\nRight to imagine if you are living in a very remote location away from your family's you don't have access to clean drinking water you don't have access to clean toilets which are the basic needs of any human being what is happening the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking under extremely dangerous conditions because people just aren't just stealing these animals from the forest and also they are going through the\nMental stress rain just have to stay away from their families and we have done a study on the mental stress and it's it's it's very shocking to what what what's the situation is that ranges of walking under that seem to difficult dangerous conditions Wade noted cognition\nIsn't it the case that you know by not having the equipment they need and as you say suffering high rates of illness because of wherever working I mean that's ... ... but it's going to make anybody not want to go the extra Marlin doing their job to job as a dangerous one\n... but it was quite surprising when we did the subway so also raised the largest ever study done on ranges and we were quite surprised when the rain just said they really want they they're really proud of that war they love what the tea but at the same time we have to make sure\nThat if you really want them to continue doing this for than we have to support them be have to give them equipment for example ... boots\nHalf of them don't even have boots and they end up spending their own money for buying roots in uniform when every dream just salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in in McDonalds\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the ranges a it is being on drugs but where's it going I think\n... ... ... so we have to look at the\n... number one is the rangers or the government employees so it'd be neat to look into the policies that are beside the recruitment of free just training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those are the phone sneak to come to\nThe challenge we head is a leading had the ... data that we can speak to the politicians ... and really bad shape change your policies now we have that information to that has to be done all the ... group and\nWe're certainly concerned uh we have a very a a big operation in in North Carolina tore a\nContaining the the virus I currently or where it's spreading a the the difficulty we have is the security context in which that's happening is very very challenging\nAnd when you say that you mean fighting between different armed groups\nYes and there have been a number of attacks by by armed groups every every day or two really over the last number of weeks or our our teams have not been directly targeted but obviously a were there\nAnd it's very difficult to maintain a operations and even even without that there are challenges in terms of the response it's spread out over a large area now I'm a that are just sticks are quite challenging and we have had some\nAh mistrust and resistance at the community level as well which in itself has been challenging\n[noise] um I I Want to get on to that in the ... in a moment but just to on the on the the the wider security situation what does that mean for humanitarian workers who simply mean they can get out into the field and to do the work if they were shooting going on\n[noise] ah well unfortunately first that that's hardly a choice to bowl a bullet us in restive we rest unable to doesn't stop we stopped so uh the operation on terrorism is to get out into the field to trace cases find contacts vaccination\nContacts in context of contacts easing of being a ring vaccination strategy so for us it's an absolute imperative to be out there we do all desert rats chewed through ah when the school to the UN peacekeeping operations there who have provided excellent security for our teams and we have not been directly targeted\nBut certainly the violence and the attacks have really increased the level of press they've also increase the amount of security apparatus and the amount of security arrangements we have to put in place so that's increasing the demands on the operational teams it's it it also increases the stress levels\nAmongst us staff so the length of time anyone can stay in the field is short because of those stress levels\nSo it's a little bit about to mistrust amongst local community some particularly as I understand that with regard to that people's ability to to carry out traditional burials which may not be be be safe and this has led to a few attacks on humanitarian workers have you ever come up\nIt's typical we we've seen this in many many ... and I and I think you know in context if if if if you have a death in any community and that doesn't matter if it's a north cable or or or north London or this is a risk disease that people have taken away quickly in a in a very very um\nA severe way I'm communities react to that uh they have very traditional means of of caring for of preparing buddies for burial and burying people in the spiritual aspect of this is is is very very important\nSo when outsiders coming to remove bodies when I was had just come in to remove sick people with communities can react and react very negatively so we have a lot of work with communities to engage them to discuss to talk to negotiate\nAn abiding by and large cycles extremely well we're very skilled communicators local Congolese and an an an international staff who do that but on occasion that dozens a goal so well and in particular situations and we've seen this and and witness this recently where there has been a an element of manipulation or\nA triggering of that response by elements within the community who are are looking to create and foment political or community um disruption or so when you have a single incident it can grow into a much larger incidents\nAnd very often that's that's driven by individuals on the community we're really pushing the community towards that kind of response this is a very um disrupted a community or they've\nHad ten Twenty years of war they've had attack after attack they've had massacres are unable as is just the latest scourge that they're having to suffer\nA one question on on ... vaccines um after the outbreak of course in West Africa how much of a game changer has that been your ability to contain this outbreak\nUm ... I think it has been a huge game changer into a ... down\nThe lines of data will tell us just how effective it was in the scientists scientific terms um and we believe it is effective and has been proven to be effective in the past a village level it is a huge game changer because in the past we come to very bodies we come to take sick people away now we come with vaccine\nAnd if you're in the village of a hundred or two hundred people who are almost everyone has been exposed\nA bringing a vaccine that offers hope to those people that they may not get the disease and they may not die creates a huge demand from the community for that service or an changes I said it in the past to\nA walking into villages in the past I was it was a seeing people with terror and the rice now you see people who have open their eyes they're not happy either upset they've lost a loved one but at least they can have their children vaccinated and that's changing the dynamic\nBut having said that even with that vaccination available even with new therapeutics available at the treatment units which is again a game changer\nAre there are ... are still pockets in the community of deep mistrust this mistrust goes back a very long time and that mistrust can be manipulated as\nAn can be turned against the international teams [noise]\nUm and we just have to work through that we have to grind through that in the daily communications process with those communities it's made all the more difficult because our time with those communities is limited by the general security situation\nSo it's like a double whammy you can't operate completely freely you can spend the time you need to spend with communities to engage and communicate with them both Ebola outbreak\nAnd in that process communities don't get a complete understanding or can be influenced by others and you get the community response is a woman who won a negative forces driving another negative force\nAnd that was a doctor Mike ... of the W.

the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such a nice you bring so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged drifted across the landscape and injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrespassing known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board asked the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die Kemba spring during the growing season the summer I called hurtful or back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year ... just been sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators tried to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive a couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way\nAnd by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like Ted now\nPersonally I don't believe in spraying dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray\nI mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new die Campbell tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop of ... show everybody says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up that can bud blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people and five and I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed\nThat legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't\nGet injured [noise] and then he'd be tempted to spray dot camera to\nDan Charles NPR News\nScience Nineteen on MORNING edition here on your NPR station Houston Public media news it eat\nSupport

Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauce if the answer to Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company\nDecided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke this story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiked the morning so can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus\nUm information like their gender birth date ... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affect the number is abuser is small it's only about potentially half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of it but the real questions that are reporting focus on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apt to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming a forwarded this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach and just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nFacebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way ...\nWell have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThe U.S so that they're they took it pretty drastic step which they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big steps they're also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like gee now there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to end the developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels\nIn the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again based\nOn your reporting should people feel safe using Google's they care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you know can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues in writing a story who was working with fellow reporter Robert McMillan ah thanks much for joining us when it's very much for having me\nIn Alaska a ballot measure is cutting right to the heart of the state's identity it's hitting Alaskans love for salmon against another powerful force the oil and mining industries Elizabeth horrible has this\nStory she's with Alaska's energy desk and NPR's energy and environment team\nUsing his boat across whiskers creek Mike would points out a massive shadows undulating just beneath the current the last of this year

walking along the creek would says he thinks it's a long overdue change\nThe scale is been tipped too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines and oil developments in the works\nIf it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat among other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties would acknowledge is that in a state like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this\nIt's really kind of\nSome in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has\nDepended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blip to that like this wire\nIt claims to protect fish habitat\nActually improved his burns and new regulations that slow or stop Alaska projects\nCompanies have poured millions into the campaign against a ballot measure with help from donors like BP and ExxonMobil they know raised more money than all free of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined\nTurn Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far coexist it with mine to Earl developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nBut ... thinks the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers we couldn't\nHave the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans feminine more than just a living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source and a

to her or to us with your store in the workplace or management issues things for weighing in here Alison\nHi David thanks for having me we talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because politics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them\nIt's still going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationships and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you went to be aware of trapped bystanders he might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful it out that\nIt also at some level is a diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with the boss politically that's going to cut out\nSome talent I think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drying them into conversations sort of making them feel complicit envy points that they find pretty harmful or offensive\nLard these days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is\nResolved I'm not going to talk about this work regardless of what side of that particular issue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying oh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think that it from the other side if your coworker we're talking about a candidate at all the time who you've found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office ... and then it may impact the way that you thought of that person may impact the relationship in subtle ways and there's no reason that you need to inject\nInto your workplace there are a lot of other times and places to use your life and the political

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauce and the answer to Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information\nOf hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiked the morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year\nOr people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date ... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of central data breaches that is not a member of it but the real questions that are reporting focus on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming a forwarded this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breaches just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nOf Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way ... what\nHave they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in them\nSo that they're they took a pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is a pretty big step there are also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in\nSome data privacy potential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like Gmail there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels\nIn the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationships of developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again based\nOn your reporting should people feel safe using Google they care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google

protecting the state's most iconic fish walking along the creek would says he thinks it's a long overdue change\nThe scale is fence tip too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large mean mine's in oil developments in the works\nIf it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat among other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties what acknowledges that in the states like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this\nIs really kind of\nSome in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has depended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of ads like this wire\nIt cleans to protect fish habitat\nActually impose it brings a new regulations that flu or stop Alaska projects\nHave poured millions into the campaign against the ballot measure would help\nThe owners like BP and Exxon Mobil they'd know raised more money than all free of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turn Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far coexist it with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nMatthias thinks the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers\nWe couldn't have the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans similar more than just living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source in a traditional way of life in one of the last states were wild river's still playing with them every summer\nSo when voters head to the polls this November there'll be weighing

boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationships and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware as trapped bystanders you might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful it out that\nIt also at some level is a diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with the boss politically that is going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where
