stressing that none of these people had received what do you call it an exit package\nAnd up for re pretty Rory Google says it some can get tougher in the future against inappropriate conduct by

of sexual harassment cases over the past Twenty years\nAnd I think that he different to any other large organization within the u._k. and I think the real problem is that we haven't actually dealt with\nSexual harassment is an issue with in our society there are a number of head or for women who do feel that the sexually harassed within the place that has got to come if they want any remedy will ... they said was included the effect on that clear if they make a complaint\nThere's evidence and set any research that shows that they have a detrimental effect than any woman all non Korea if that's actually interested in the case and it's actually that they can painted they investigated by the employer was well he's ultimately liable to compensation for the kite\nSo there was too late investigating themselves that great settles live as well if they want and it gets a sauce and employment tribunal then they face\nSquad and aggressive cross examination\nThey might they may be representing themselves that much is it that we live in these claims unless they need to uh uh I lost that job\nAnd also they might be faced with a with a family experience power step caustic sat on a

that relate to sexual harassment were fat defeat digressing attached to rent the jewels and ask for not dealing with the original issues other place\nBut this does seem quite decisive action by Google the shocking of such teensy near managers and more than ... employees have a sexual harassment allegations\nI think it's definitely a positive step for organizations just talked to take sexual

vigils doesn't ask is that when he was standing issues that you face for example an investigation and sell the difficulties that women face in the house you have to make a complaint\nAnd in fact the

Seventy as anti microbial drugs which has antibiotics of successfully treated patients with infections but over time many infectious organisms have adapted to the drugs that killed them making them less effective maybe using misusing these drugs can make resistance develop even foster [noise]\nTo the United states for instance at least two million people each year also to become infected with bacteria\nThat are resistant to antibiotics these twenty three thousand or die on you as a result of these some sections but scientists say\nThey developed a new antibiotic could could help in the fight against drug resistant bacteria with me and the student professor Graham co chair of the world Health Organization's antibiotics are working group I gave statistics from the United states but this is a global problem\nYou know if a global problem and wishing it throughout the wealth both in rich countries in poorer countries in terms of the challenge it poses\nA particularly in Southeast Asia and we have problems with emotion resistance but we're seeing it in the u._k. as well\nAnd the real concern is that this might threaten routine health care that we take for granted my my my corporations and chemotherapy\nSo you're saying that there's a resistance is is becoming entrenched if you'd like within the medical system\nA new spin routine pulse of practice or certainly in this country and in most countries in will now ... and all always if they knew you were there to becoming more limited so we have fewer into politics we can use and some of these patients and that's the real concern is looking more books that have very resistant to antibiotics we called\nSo what is this ... this one that could be more effective\nTo fit a recall is is the new antibiotic I Believe it's pronounced and so this is a kind of tweak on an existing antibiotics so it takes an existing plow fence politics and it puts on an additional components which ... which bacteria will take can cite them so it's been described as a Trojan Horse which is\nA bit simple but it's probably quite helpful bacteria have a wolf which protects them but it's not just to start it will take things in and out and bacteria very good at figuring things out over the world if they didn't like it including antibiotics\nBut when a factor in people and does it mean response trying to get rid of that infection as a tussle for on the body tries to keep on bacteria one time\nAnd they have special molecules to bring on it and say well this antibiotic has done is to\nAttach one of these molecules so the bacteria take band politicking at times of stress and get it inside bacteria and so\nIn doing that it becomes a lot of the natural resistance that bacteria have to some other antibiotics ended up being human trials some yeah so that so that they too we've seen published today we heard about a few months ago but it's encouraging face to dates and we have these ... that go through three phases for their proof and so this is the end of the second phase of development\nAnd this was a trial in adults with urine infection complicated human infections that people getting admitted to hospital with kicking fictional bladder infection needing intravenous antibiotics and they were given either their sense of Baltic will and will stand in ... and um\nThey did at least is what if not better with this new into ... which is very encouraging but it's not we still need more data it's just one type of infection so\nAntibiotic itself could be a more effective but what about that problem than identified the abuse and misuse of antibiotics some making resistance develops you ever come\nTo the I mean it's a very complicated issue and there are lots of different types of different things that needs to be done\nBut to get three examples than one way of reducing the amount of us who uses by preventing infection with vaccinations if you get your flu vaccine this winter your chances of getting a\nFire and infection go down but then on top of that if you put a bacterial infection you antibiotics so vaccination can help us in that way\nAnd and it is also helpful to get rid of the expectation for the people that they should have and so when you go to a doctor feeding 'em well\nHaving an expectation of antibiotics leads to increased prescribing an end until he was as a whole ...

were two really important species that we're using it mainly as dumb as a nesting grounds and an ... ground\nTo fast what green castles and endangered species especially in this part of the Pacific and still that's really quite good proportion of the Hawaiian green sea turtles or using east island to lay their eggs we do know I think that\nThey females this year had finished laying their eggs and they had laid left the islands so that that probably All right they would have gone back into the ocean and and they can deal with storms when they're out to sea that's fine\nBut we think that probably somewhere around ... all the nest that had been laid the exit have been late this yeah hadn't touched me ... and the child is out they would have been swept away\nSo ready to be looking at maybe potentially impact that ... and then the question is what happens next year when they come back to try and lay their eggs again and find any any land to do that and that's one group the other consenting space age really foot this place all the Hawaiian monk seals\nNow this is one of the most critically endangered ocean mammals ocean going mammals we have\nIn the world and they basically live around the Hawaiian Islands and the politics of the Pacific we think it could be something like eighty percent tells the whole species lives that and I get a really large\nProportional that population comes to east into these they did to read that pops again we think probably the females and actually this is pops it probably mostly weaned and they had swam away all ... clutch show new seals actually okay the big question is\nWhat happens next year when the breeding season comes back around again and there's no way to the top without them after the war time they\nAlso have all the threats that they're facing tattoos and sales base have\nProblems of getting entangled in fishing nets and and that other responses to climate change sea turtles actually\nThe amounts of that the number of the study that become females or miles is dependent on the temperature so we actually thickness of a shift potentially going to happen in the the sort of ratios male to female which could also say that population they face a loss of challenges and they're going to have to hunting around for a a place to to lay their eggs and came\nTo read that young this is an extra stress that they really don't need\nAn had him this isn't the the first on during this time to be swept away in this area\nAnd then that's right so not too far away there's another article trick island and I think it was just I think it was just out this year actually that was another case why we think in that case we think it was actually just dodge a wave that's again inundated the very low lying areas stand I mean these are you know that that way\nThere's nothing particularly on these islands as my\nVegetation just because somebody just pause assigned um\nAnd yet that want to get and seems to dissipate Denise waves and then again I think the same sort of thing reading portion habitat for the important things are titles and and and monk seals so so we all seeing really quite substantial eating away all states are important habitats in this particular area\nAnd in the history of the world presumably this is a phenomenon because quite often but it but if it's happening more often\nThat's the question and and you're absolutely I mean the geology tells us that she sees come and go items come and go\nThis isn't something that's necessary to complete young natural but really it's there it's the rates at which we might see this happening in the future though it's it's concerning I mean as we stand these two particular items that we've we've seen disappearing this year the question of how much climate change and a woman sees a warming atmosphere has a play that\nIsn't completely so sudden but I think what we can be fairly K owners it certainly plays a politician that\nAs well as other

the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kelly Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow tied I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real\nThey work these crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home cooked meals smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so\nIt's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come to a main bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite shifts they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table into a closet like\nTwo years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and Pecos took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out and affection money\nSo that's a snapshot at the situation here and take us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have been here for generations\nThe mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize it there are people who are being left behind all the ... is the county attorney she's a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing here we are [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door\nHow are you sir [noise]\nI'm trying to get their bowed out for Beto O'Rourke [noise]\nOkay thanks bye-bye\nBeto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... would have an uphill battle here\nPeople I knew um who had been Democrats ... years having now just\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nBetter because even if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of any hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town\nSo what happened to the blue wave\nI mean the reason but our work has gotten so much that's where media attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history [noise] uh

people like the feeling of the momentum here no well and the impact of the oil boom as you heard the shifting politics and pick us but like we said this is a really big congressional district it is

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in this very red state it\nCovers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio and we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections\nImmigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river ... means friendship in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll real case it's the city of a junior Mexico\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations\nAnd our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon ya I don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I Want them to come here the right way Amanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph law also grew\nUp here like going to be like some tea okay I really would be in a hot humid or higher than manned across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week what to say that\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but he also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep it all because I get on my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think\nIt makes me very angry what do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they say separate a while there is a while I don't think anybody backing you what you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nOf this rule rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a\nTour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico that's one good\nBefore he bought his starts talking about the border wall\nThe new suit in this natural state\nLike who is a war zone on her\nTo me before he started throwing money at a problem\nYou have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence\nInstead there are these houses along the riverbank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem there\nSaid on the side there's Mexico\nJust across this little yeah that's even a river this looks like an earthquake of increased the Rio Grande river how many feet are we talking about\nAh we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner feet [noise]\nI mean that's how hard to some across\nSo at night and someone can just ... just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nAsked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support that people like Jeff Martinez\nWill has come to an air of giving them the same tour like well he's he felt that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and had some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or if we were over there everybody else was even the bones were eating bologna\nAnd I think that to solve the immigration issue the sheriff has to be at the table you can't you can't just go to jail because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras\nInstead of putting the physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people in Mexico are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nMeanwhile people like Amanda gear a block out the noise it up a wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her backyard\nAnd she did for that\nAnd just like that were in Mexico he the exchange faces rent here when they dollar exchange so this is how can you we walked down the main streets filled with bars [noise]\nAnd stores selling all kinds of Mexican handicrafts we thought that one storefront or a woman is sewing handmade dolls stressed and colorful dresses\nShe actually making them it's not my sheet and they're not coming from China these are authentic maybe they can I\nAdd a check to check in with a smile she not just for a long black hair over her shoulder and waved goodbye and I had I guess in her white SUV and wait for a long line to cross back over

into calculations showing how technological bright ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things which is which is coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism I things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plan\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of\nTwo winners of the Nobel Prize in economics ... welcome to the program\nGlad to be here I mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs\nThe complacent attitude would have been to say it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything can turn out better for everybody but if you just are complacent say out it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nAnd with artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who said don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely ... and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know the twentieth century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nThere are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably I think I'm a pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights in economics is this idea of a division of labor\nAnd do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves\nA kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or uh any other politician builds coalitions they tried to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there are some things that you could try but ... you are the ones who make the decision\nBefore we go to a doctor rumor at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking spot did NYU give you anything [laughter]\nWell let's just say we're in

C. a massive search is underway for the person or people who mailed would appear to be bombs to critics of President Trump\nYeah at least ten suspicious packages were sent to a list of notable names including President Obama his former attorney general and his one time CIA director and parents justice correspondent\nCarrie Johnson has been following this story as it has been developing good morning Carrie good morning All right so let's get up to speed on the investigation is there any more information on on who may have done this\nNot yet the investigation seems to be centered in two places one is the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia which is analyzing these devices may look like homemade pipe bombs and the experts at the FBI will be looking for clues about how the bombs were constructed what materials were used\nThey'll also be looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind on the devices or those ... retired investigators are telling me that is very promising because so many of these devices are intact\nThey didn't explode but if history is a guide that whole process could take a while it will be a mediator overnight\nWell last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility outside of Miami what do we know about about that place and what they were looking for their\nThe postal service ... is an over locker near Miami the operating theory for now is that some or all of the ten packages went through that facility in through the u._s. mail\nInvestigators were looking for more devices but also any other clues and there's a lot of manpower deployed here and around the country\nThe postal inspectors the FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives are already on the case as his homeland security so our local police like the bomb squad and canine unit at the Miami Dade police force narrow ... and of course the New York police department as well and\nCarry it is really notable that none of these devices so far have gone off have exploded what do we know about the threat that's actually posed by them\nThere is an open question about that police and the FBI or decline to answer questions on the record about whether those bombs could have been a lethal threat\nFormer officials that the ATF are raising questions about whether they included a key component that would have set off the devices in fact some retired investigator say they appear to lack at least one critical component\nBut New York police commissioner Paul O'Neill set a news conference yesterday\nThat powder and the bomb Santa actor Robert De Niro\nIf not a biological threat like anthrax for instance O'Neill was still quick to add police are taking this very seriously and he says if you see a suspicious device don't touch it don't move it instead call police or the FBI immediately this is being taken with the utmost seriousness he says\nIt sounds like good advice NPR's Carrie Johnson thanks so much Carrie my pleasure [noise] [noise]\n[noise] or at a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and Marist shows that President Trump is a major factor driving people to vote in the mid term elections this year\nRight the poll also shows that Republicans have had trouble selling their signature legislative achievement is is the tax overhaul they've had a hard time selling not voters\nNPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here with more on the pole the morning to medical good morning All right let's start with President Trump and Republicans they saw this bump in enthusiasm right among the base during justice Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to that bump last\nWell Kevin factor really appears to have faded as a salient motivating issue you know Republicans have maintained actually their level of enthusiasm but the pollsters say that that probably has more to do with the fact that it's October [laughter]\nAnd they're being a natural rise closer to election day because when you look specifically at cabinet in this poll the number of people saying he\nMotivating their vote has actually gone down even among Republicans and we also see the president's approval rating is back down to thirty nine percent and uh Democrats have expanded their lead to ten points on that crucial question of whether you vote for a Democrat or Republican in your district\nOr maybe just a temporary bump 'em you don't pass polls have shown the women by and large do not like this president does this new polls show him making any midterms are any inroads excuse me ahead of the mid term\nNot at all I mean one of our poster said it's all about the quote gender gap gender gap gender gap or they said that if\nTwenty ten twenty fourteen those elections were about Republicans or you know when they took back the house was that was about men upset with President Obama twenty Eighteen is about women motivated to vote against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular white college educated women give the president among the lowest ratings of any group and are among the highest to believe that the elections are very important\nSo Rachel said a little bit earlier Republicans have had trouble selling the big tax overhaul to voters this was their big legislative achievement um do we know why that is and do we have do we have a sense of what is going to motivate people to turn out to vote this year\nWell you know we're talking about the president he is the driving factor in these elections to third said that President Trump will either be a major or minor factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate\nUm again I come back to the power of women in this election fifty one percent of women overall fifty four percent of women who live in the suburbs where a lot of these key house races are being run say the president is in quote major factor in their vote\nOr those who say President Trump is a major factor by the way are twice as likely to vote for a Democrat\nIn a couple of weeks and when you talk about those tax cuts I can tell you that that is not motivated voters are more people say that they're likely to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when asked about the rising federal deficit sixty percent of people including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they prefer to roll back the tax cuts rather than touch Social Security Medicare or Medicaid\n... NPR's medical months and our thanks to mimic oh You're welcome our ... I Want to get your thoughts on what to medical was saying because you have been in Texas for the last week talking to voters\nRight let's talk about Texas I Am currently in Del Rio which is\nJust next to lake ... on the Rio Grande river which separates the U.S and Mexico and this is the last stop on a week long road trip that we've done through the twenty third congressional district here in Texas this is one of the state's only true swing districts\nTotally fascinating place and well that sounds about a third of the entire U.S Mexico border\nOkay so this is a massive district and I wonder as you've been knocking doors talking to people does any of what the medical was just saying line up with what you've been hearing from people particularly from women\nRight so he mentioned the power women so we want to talk to some especially in the suburbs around San Antonio suburban women are really going to be influential in these midterms we met a woman named Janet Ogle for ... ah she like a lot of white liberal women in this country said that Donald Trump's election\nJust devastated our uh and really caused her to become politically active in a completely new way now she registers people to vote she volunteered for democratic candidates I'm and she is committed in a way she never was before let's listen to a little bit\nWish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary now I Do ...\nSo at the same time or I should note we also talked with one of Janet's neighbors a Republican who really likes what President Trump is doing in fact she was going to speak with us a on Monday we had this all scheduled and she had to reschedule so that she could road trip to Houston with her friends to see Donald Trump do his thing at a Houston rally\n[laughter] All right and I know that while you been down there you also been looking at particular economic factors in these places and you you visited a place that's experiencing something like an oil boom\nSomething I mean totally boom I'm this is a place called ... Texas\nIt's really benefited from uh all the fracking that's been happening in oil country I'm just to give you a sense of how the place has grown in twenty tend the population was around eight thousand people today city officials don't even know what the real popular while they speculate that because of all the temporary oil workers who are there\nAre there could be up to fifty thousand people living there at any given time which has put a massive strain on the town because it ... it all happened so quickly they haven't been able to really keep up there's not enough food on the grocery store shelves they don't have enough restaurants\nBut what's really interesting is how it seems to be changing the politics of the place most of the population is Hispanic traditionally they've been Democrats\nBased on our conversations there that could actually be shifting a because these all these new people are coming in with new viewpoints people who give the party in power credit for the current economic boom I Want to play a clip a from a conversation we had with a guy named John pack\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as opposed to the he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing uh she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does the poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump two thirds said that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we does it when we drove in\nSpecifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs in the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close for Democrats health care and climate change\nA notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than okay entitlements\nAnd fears of medical months in our across\nThe Midwest it's grain harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\nHarvest sleeping in ... Iowa the combine blades tied to them cause are pulled apart and the hard yellow being filled the hopper\nI'll sentence cousin pose a matching red tractor up alongside positioning the attached rains higher catch the beans as they're offered out of the combined\n[noise] us from agriculture predicts a record sleeping harvest this year such high enough\nOnce a major market for ... impose a twenty five percent tariff\nSlashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the prize Osman send will get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop most\nIt was a big lab and this year just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariffs impact but ... says that's not a real effects but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming\nI think\nHe call off of it are enrolling to Iowa these Web cranks open the hopper on a semi to let savings cascade ... from their there'll be conveyed by storage\nIn Iowa State at the communist Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to hold this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina has stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of planes from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to come into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer on dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop\nThat with Paris taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans hit the ban for NPR News I'm Amy Mayer in Ames, Iowa\nAnd at six

Florida\nThe operating theory for now is that some or all of these ten packages went through that facility and through the u._s. mail investigators are looking for more devices but also any other clues there\nThere's a lot of manpower deployed not just in Florida but all over the country\nThe postal inspectors are on the case the FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives homeland security investigators and so our local police the bomb squad and a canine unit at the Miami Dade police force and of course the New York police department in full force to carry\nIt's notable that none of these packages have actually exploded and that's led to some speculation that maybe they don't have the capacity to blow up and hurt people what an investigator saying about that\nNothing on the record on the left and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether these devices actually pose a lethal threat to anyone\nFormer officials that the ATF are raising questions about whether\nThey included a key component that would have set off the devices in fact\nA couple of them say it looks like they were missing a key component New York police commissioner Paul O'Neil said it in a news conference yesterday\nThat powder in the bomb sent the actor Robert De Niro is not a biological threat like anthrax for instance but O'Neill is quick to add police are still taking this very seriously he says if you see a suspicious device don't touch it jumped move it instead call the authorities immediately\nIt sounds like good advice many of the people who are sent these devices were in politics or at least very outspoken about politics is that helping investigators determine a motive\nThere is a big underlying question about motive right now if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare or intimidate Felipe people in was the motive of political one are somehow a personal one remember these bombs were address an actress\nOr housing sites that have popped up in the last two years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kaylee Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow

businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have\nBeen

you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about uh what she thought was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect distorting the what we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role

F. L. dot edu [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas home of member station Katie P. D.\nAnd I'm Noel King in Washington DC good morning\nInvestigators are still searching for the person or people responsible for sending ten suspicious packages to political and public figures around the country\nWhere did he keep updating you this morning with the latest on that investigation but first we're going to take a step back and look at how law enforcement has dealt with dangerous mail packages in the past\nAnd how that's informing this current probe\nJoining us now is NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre yeah Great Hey Noel All right so the government is putting a lot of resources into this investigation and this is not the first at type of investigation or investigation of this sort in the countries of recent history what have investigators learned from those those earlier probes\nWell the first of all we know these are relatively rare going all the way back to Nineteen Seventy they've just been fifty seven package bombs and twenty three additional cases of dangerous materials like anthrax or rice and um these figures come from the start consortium which studies terrorism at the at the University of Maryland\nBeen fewer than twenty death but one big change some of the cases in the past were very very hard to solve or the ... the Unabomber was on the loose for Seventeen years\nThere was the anthrax case that killed five people in two thousand and one that went on for seven years and then the ... the main suspect was a committed suicide before he could\nBe charged so technology now has made it much easier to track people or is intrusive as it may be what are some of the technologies and how to law enforcement officials use them\nSo the deterrence really begins before packages even mailed them and we just have surveillance cameras everywhere certainly at a at a post office or a FedEx facility you're likely to be on videotape before you send a package\nAnd then a lot of packages are actually photographed an X ray and and as you know they can be tracked throughout the journey and then as they get toward the destination if you're a\nA if it's a sensitive government facility or a an important official disease offsite male facilities and that's come into play twice recently we've seen packages that we're headed to the private homes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nThose were picked up at the offsite facilities and a letter to to James Madison or just a few weeks ago at the Pentagon that had rice and in it that also was stopped at the Pentagon's offsite facility back\nIn March you remember there was this series of package bombs that terrorized Austin, Texas in that area um were some of these techniques part of that investigation\n... yeah they were now that that was a case where a several bombs to people were killed several or injured and then a package exploded at a FedEx station and that and that was our FedEx Office and that was really the break they needed they go back they look at the surveillance tape they find a suspect\nUm and then they can do all sorts of things they can check\nOf phone records who was in that area your phone is a GPS tracking device who is in there at the time um they can check the street and highway a cameras that that we license plates all sorts of things start to come into play there's so many ways to be tracked now so the technology\nIs getting better do you think it's also fair to say that bomb squad teams are getting better\nUm yes they are in for a reason that that may surprise you I spoke with William Bratton of who's the director of the that start consortium at the University of Maryland that I mentioned and he explained where this new generation of investigators is coming from\nThese are individuals who may have spent lots of time over the place like Afghanistan and Iraq dealing with explosive devices on a daily basis so massive learning curve in conflict zones\nSo that's about the most intensive on the job training you can get in a place like Iraq or Afghanistan and as these guys come back um they're they're going to places like the FBI the ATF local bomb squads\nOh so they're all benefiting from the experience NPR's national security correspondent Greg my regret things so much thank you [noise]\nAnd now we turn to the mid term elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country\nTexas' twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state's only real truth ... swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual en masse it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe drove into hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we passed hunter circles entrance gate hunters do\nEvery street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it that much more confusing again\nThis is Janet Ogle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay little sweaty or\nHave you taken ... we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac\nGet it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole everyone sort of keeps to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we headed out for a walk we've gone straight yeah actually it's been this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women when Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart\nAnd to get\nTogether I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood and\nI actually got a pink Cape my first year because I put in more hours and [laughter] people could me about it much in it you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in our house so is it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware politically but I've also been complacent\nI mean look around we're in this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about\nHistory I Wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary and now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the ... are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween\nSo if you like we can cut right through here to my house ... okay there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign then he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record to electric you the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kicked good for you\nIt's just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think um when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've\nHeard and seen that whatever he says it's find\nWhoever he hurts assigned\nGen its neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump\nHi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more\nEveryone likes the direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious the onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through two songs to flow a\nIt's very concerning and ah there's just no accounting for all these people\nFlowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular that were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as opposed to the he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio same thing she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here\nWhat about issues the medical I mean it does the poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump to third said that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we does it won't be dove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close for Democrats it's health care and climate change\nA notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than okay entitlements\nAnd fears of medical months in our\nAcross the Midwest it's grain harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade or that decimated the Chinese market for
