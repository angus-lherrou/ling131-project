from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm David Greene more details are emerging now about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist ... in Turkey\nBecause so gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post says it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance that team\nOf Fifteen Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate the post is also reporting those Fifteen men departed stumble later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn a stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\n[noise] uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper or describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say our military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV meanwhile are airing footage\nOf ... entering that constantly on October second and of a black van leaving the consulate about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nX. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off\nBut the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy ... one of the two points and not both the planes\nWell that's a all we know based on the information we have so far uh this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case\nIt what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details a one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and the bone so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw 'em talk of an assassin assassination squad it sounds like\nTurkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that this was a targeted murder\nYes that's certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that this Yogi was spirited out of the country or I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course denied any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left the constantly within an hour of arriving\nBut they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate\nOr they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out uh they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission and that we're told could happen as early as today a there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalist was killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could the sort of the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nA turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't\nOh anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh costs for us investigators to joined the pro are happening uh let's see if something like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company any lessons encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate change in carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxon Mobil his voice support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nFertile since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions turtles and says the carbon tax his group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBernstein says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's been Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says with the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way or sugar coating it or Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on us all ills is even more difficult\nGreg Myrtle Senate knowledge is the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's John Ydstie on NPR News\nAnd find forty two It's MORNING edition here on your NPR

C. American farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nFor acting and all All right [noise] we are on the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ... good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that so so\nLast night the president laid out his intend to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called ... Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could prop up corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHope to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road or certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can you explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation said the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no released that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nAre there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change do the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nI'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races\nWe're pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble she was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the

Culver City California there are more details are emerging about the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... turkey so gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance of the team\nOf Fifteen Saudi men flew into stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate the post is also reporting with those Fifteen men departed stumble later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn is stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point of view learned more facts here\n[noise] uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of them in some they say our military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile are airing footage of ... entering that constantly on October seconds and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nX. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy for one of the two points and not both the planes\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and let a bone so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that ... was spirited out of the country I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course denied any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left the consulate within an hour of arriving\nBut they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate\nThey say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today and there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where that black men went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could this through to the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones as quote Trump\nI don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh cause for us investigators to join the probe are happening uh let's see if something like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon though bird will soon as group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong and which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the ...\nI've been taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it or Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal send acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect John Ydstie NPR News

Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes that haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change do the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the state so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a I was governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president and she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth that you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans\nAnd he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey but there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mansion on election day here's West Virginia public radio they've missed itch\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n\nShow it on order and\nThat evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston in the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office Miller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion\nShe says he was a tenant and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but he adds that if I'm In the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do\nTurn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mentioned is new liberal but his defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen so she won't vote for mansion in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion conversation will leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Marcy either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nAll three woman so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate Formica Bhutto that voting record is a sign that mentioned is an independent thinker computer was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions own in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and they did they acted accordingly or somebody was going to be happy about that and so I'm just going to be mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree\nA hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut computers as mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or non affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet ... believes mentioned as certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for cabin all that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington for NPR News I'm Dave message in Morgantown West
