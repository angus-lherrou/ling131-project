among the fast we they hid which sets something because there are lots of people in St since then and very importantly fit the political prisoners who are in jail unjustly\nWhatever we're a little disappointed lately because we think that we need to take this final step in the right now we're out of the points that we see that this is not happening and everything is very paralyzed and the people are waiting for that a push\nBut let's talk are smiling Kevin ... who is in Barcelona what's the situation is one in ...\nI think the the basically we're in a situation where the petitions are looking at the ramifications of last night's two things went on\nYesterday we had in the huge protests through the streets hundred and eighty thousand people lost the peaceful\nAnd then separately goats a grassroots organization of independence activists some say a more extreme end the CD all the committee for the defense of the republic now these these uh hundreds of thousands of people and we didn't you know there are many ... to pop peacefully protest now what we saw yesterday were two things one is the you know cutting off of\nA train line for the rush hour for the for the cause\nWe've seen that before we haven't seen before all with the core of about two hundred people that most of the storm and breached the barriers outside the captain on parliament also by a image of national police station in in the center of a sudden I'm that's what led to clashes ... protested finish this is eleven o'clock last night\nAnd the group ... to the doors of parliament they look to be stalling politics at one point and riot police came in um ... we used to using some projectiles that brief clashes push them back\nAnd I think what's happening now of ramifications looking at the sites a fault line now in the independence movement which is is you have the president Kim throughout the separatists catch it on President who said yesterday that protests district keep pushing it's working\nSo now that you have the prime minister of Spain at Petra scientists who said on the radio about an hour ago that that rhetoric must stop that he needs to calm the radicals he said otherwise we're going to see violence in Catalonia so I think that's where we all this cool elements that some particularly Spanish\nPoliticians in Madrid believe the ... president\nHas almost urged tacitly to do things that perhaps previously they wouldn't\n[noise] Kevin thank you Kevin Lee updating us from Barcelona when groups of whales are found floundering on beaches usually that means that got lost and confused

states to buy a homeland of the workers policy [noise]\nThey feel\nAround there is probably not the silver [noise]\nHe was the president wanted assigned\nBut he was well here in Britain\nRoger in we're going to say\nHave all these workers bodies I give him\nFar less well known\nReally not\nThat they didn't come in handy\nI understand that you want to be free anything he shouldn't be allowed to find a lot of the country [noise]\nI've never even heard of but I Know that you\nHis life a little less place\nIf you had to describe Fernando ... ... ... words would you use ...\nCannot say much but there's more to say trust [noise] [noise]\n... race in six years I mean among workers policy Lewis goes all the way up to the told the president of the ... team by state to everyone around her and see us how\nHe talks ... in fact he doesn't read to control the policy putting up a strong presidential candidate front and center he talks about presenting a project\nFor even the ... we had a debate about this inside the party for quite some time we already knew that the Brazilian justice system would make ... political prisoners the chance that he would be allowed to run was minimal\nHowever would we decided to do was to work on a project to make the defense of democracy the central issue of democracy I guess like a stump something all\nRight but he has made it more difficult by\nWaiting until the last possible moment you say that you will running with a project rather than with a candidate but that's not how presidential elections work on the other side you've got this one very strong charismatic candidates\nAnd then you've got this man who a lot of people say we've never heard of him I don't know who he is\n... we make the decision to defend democracy of democracy yeah\nIt's interesting to hear you talk\nBecause you talk about ... days you to bad obstructions you know talking about the candidate to\nWhat do you think of to attach\nA ...\nHe wasn't the best place person to run in this election he lost when you ran for reelection is now ... but\nHe is committed to the Workers Party ideology and he has to technical knowledge needed to run a government\nDo understand that there is a lot of anger and disillusioned with the P. T.\nBecause of corruption because of crime\nBecause of the worst ever recession that Brazil has endured while the use of being in power\nSee like you get ... but didn't implement ... yes I'm not saying we haven't made any mistakes but we're not responsible for corruption in Brazil for the sake he's stationed at the P. T. said corrupting ... doesn't stand up with a it was only ... by the media to kick us out of power\nPolitics in Brazil until twenty sixteen was funded by companies and that meant hockey's without any hypocrisy had accounts to fund all that money into that kind of have this was a mistake and to the tea also took part in that game so they all neutral\nOne final question people always say that the election it's bound to happen wherever it is in the world they always say this is the most important election we've ever had we've had for years and years and years\nWhat do you really think how important is this election\nThey'll ask about him you know there are some\nFor my generation and since the military coup in sixty four it is the most important election what's at risk is our democracy the milk our values and principles ...\nEver I'll do an unjust oh from the west coast policy in Brazil ending that report from Tim Frank's in the northeast of that country well I've been speaking to professor Anthony ... better he's director of the Brazil Institute at King's College and\nLondon what all Brazilians voting for this time around\nThey go to a very complex ballot to deal with for the first round there Thirteen candidates for president um they've got to vote for state deputies federal\nDeputies senators I think when it comes to the presidential election it's shaping up into two horse race between for them to a dodgy ... and those are that's a difficult choice for many Brazilian voters because of the nature of both the candidates and the parties that they come from\nHow much do Brazilians want to vote for this pack of politicians bearing in mind that Lula who you know once upon a time had the reputation of a U.S ally saint and is now in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes are excited heart Brazilians about voting for any politician\nI'm not sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidate that they can find Brazil was sort of on auto pilot from the period Nineteen Ninety four to two thousand and ten you had a series of elections where\nWhen there was a second round of the presidential election it was a choice between a center right candidate an essential left candidate\nAnd they agreed on a lot of major policy issues and now you've got quite a hard right candidate enjoyable so NATO\nSomeone who's economic advisor Paolo get his and said you know privatize every state owned enterprises can with have a flat\nTax let's end affirmative action in universities lets the ideal or jazz or schools teaching and so on and then you got for not do a dodgy from the workers' party which rules from two thousand three to two thousand and sixteen and many people don't want to see back so you've got a hard core that would\nBe very disappointed at either a dodgy ... presidency\nSo does that mean that ... who has a reputation for\nBeing very outspoken in very unpleasant ways talking about we had five children unfortunately one of them was go a kind of thing because at least have something different and the corruption ... so many who are on the progressive side is he likely to win\nI think if you look at the polling there was a new poll today that had the second round scenario had\nBoth ... and a dodgy in a technical tie it forty two percent each so he definitely has a chance to win the election we also said about the dictatorship of sixty four to eighty five the\nMistake of the dictatorship was to torture and not to kill its opponents so he's got a very hard line stance on that and his vice presidential candidate general Modelo has talked about well maybe if there's too much disorder the military is going to have to close down Congress I Would say yes he has a chance to win\nIt may be that the antipathy in the electorate to the Workers Party is going to outweigh the reservations that people have about some of these things that both so now to set and their offensive to women and afro Brazilians to gays and so on whatever the outcome is likely to be quite close between the two of them\n[noise] that is professor and so they put it at our from the Brazil Institute at King's College in London you're listening to well to update

state can have over ... Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed the standards that the federal level Kim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor and he actually claimed the term net neutrality Tim welcome\nTo the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice not neutrality\nYou know I I think that they uh uh I've decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and are they are concerned that California's meddling with a federal policy\nWell hell effect is is California's position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue that's interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nIn about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the wire to the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's a but a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid sets and dozens of other states are considering that mentality allows me\nIn fact dozens of other states have are you not neutrality love it you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is\nWhere the states are sort of free to ah experiment economically filling up the federal government has abandoned and neutrality for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union\nIn other words we want there to be no rules for any Internet providers and other states or feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish and in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of France on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is a dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California ... law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that it's a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on it\nI mean I I I think almost all of them one they've all said they they like and that neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. will try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans one child who loves that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to this law the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are ah are trying to fill the gap\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much free time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise]\nHow much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nApprove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and\nFor the American auto worker but as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages\nAnd that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up appeals to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...

state to abolish cash bail late this summer governor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor turns out though the stories more\nThe kid now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nAnd also in the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abou dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or SP ten which abolish is money bail in America's most populous state\nAfter all ... and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of a bias system\nThe size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the new has to be ten doesn't actually change the racist system of mass incarceration just expands it\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deepen the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will tilt the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ... and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual\nGuilt is pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fen already knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nAll that how it should also keep track of like ... ... people are ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say they will be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court as soon as it takes effect next

assistant director of the FBI thanks very much\nThank you Steve [noise]\nAll right there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means I mean I get money and just to note here Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters filling out what\nOther details can you share right so they she press release in here if he takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned at the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part-time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers which is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically\nIssued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars and ... and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is on um well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about the Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outline but just the conditions of workers this is this change a result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about\nUm it's a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our fulltime workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you count in all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base us a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington I'm a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of just days us not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man and history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um\nAnd they had a little science talking specifically about that I'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become and a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big and they did buy a whole foods recently they

California is on track to find out just how much control one state can have over giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that that they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a an environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nI'm In about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little ... is an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's a what a California's argument will be\nWhat is the precedent this kid says I mean dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiments economically a filling gaps the federal government has abandoned the neutrality um for reasons\nKnown to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet\nProviders and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented and so I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is as dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on\nHow you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them one they've also they they like and that neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise] how much besides the title is really changing in the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat is President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U. S.\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local ...\nBurr and environmental laws there are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more ... here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid carrots\nChat down as a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up mobiles X or anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...

coat frankly\n[noise] last summer California became the largest state to abolish cash bail at the time governor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor\nTurns out though the stories more complicated many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform now say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney Jason ... would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bail in America's most populous state after all ... and fellow public service lawyers of long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of a bias system\nThe size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the races system of mass incarceration just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deepen the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded do dean argues including compass anyone for any offense that he says will to power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder a speech and no prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nThen there's its impact on the deal\nCurrently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanisms to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fen already knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should be like ... ... people are ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat and they put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say they will be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court as soon
