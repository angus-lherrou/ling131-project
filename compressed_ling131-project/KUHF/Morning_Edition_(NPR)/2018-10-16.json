I. P. U.\nAnd the parliamentary assembly of the council of Europe or we're going to hear from the secretary general of the idea of the moment first let's hear from the legion MP hey good layer dolls she's one of those who took the women's testimony\nI Am a little bit shocked over the stories it shows me there is at stake situation around women's safety in our parliament in Europe but I think it's very nice about studying is that it's all\nWell including the stuff I think we haven't had the lights on this stuff before and I think this study it's very good and we have to take action now\nBut even in Norway is there a problem because no way has a reputation for being excellent in its approach to gender balance in power for example\nIt's a sad reality that also in Norway this is happening and I have to go back home now and make sure that there is a place for those women staff or a member of parliament ... who has to say this experience that there is a place for them to go I'm not sure even in in Norway\nWhich is a very democratic at a country which is very interested in being equal between men and women and men\nI'm not sure if there is a place for them and um but that's not something in the parliament that they care so that they have been listening to that that they let it be hit and then if they let it be em it tested that day story are correct I'm not sure\nIt's about power isn't it the abuse of power\nOf course it is and it's also about that ... it is about you're right that this study shows me that we have to do more\nI suppose one point I was searching for was it it depends on the history of patriarchy and because now women are powerful in Norway is there any evidence that they abused men\nI'm not sure and I would like to have a new study which includes demand because if this is a situation for the women I'm sure that also would be things happening that we don't like also against men\nSo what's needed is to set up some kind of mechanism in parliament's everywhere in order to deal with these kinds of complaints of ... and and take them seriously that is what you want\nYes and I also think we have to really make a study each parliament on this issue that could be a star that is we have to stop with believe in those pests that they have a place to go if they have a situation\nWhat's the effect of this on the women who are cool top and this kind of harassment and what has happened to the Korea is\nWe don't know so much about that I think there\nMust be a lot of women who are working in the parliament last Easter or is it is that they hadn't told on that one maybe that didn't seek for a new job in the parliaments and\nBecause of something had happened and I also think if we don't stop ... more women would be included in ... bad behavior\nThe member of the Norwegian Parliament heck a layer do I spoke to the secretary of the entire parliamentary unions mountain ... how does he feel about forty seven percent of the women's ... saying they'd received threats of physical violence death on right\nIn a democratic society this type of behavior is warranted unjustified I'm should not be condones\nAffect your general this open my vision I Am committed to mobilizing parliament's against such harmful practices ... they may go to a democracy and legitimacy and decision making\nYour survey forty five different European countries that do have enough of a sample to say which countries are worse than what your best\nI don't think that's a this is the moment are too poor to any particular country I'm despite what's\nThe point we're making is that a dependent on is widespread I got no country is in Europe is immune to this phenomenon what just important for us is that we should come together and resolve to fight the film and an inevitable to monitor\n[noise]\nAnywhere panic in on the island where we can speak to the creation of\nThe film editor ... and Lisa Marie ... who survived the attack in twenty eleven both of you thanks for being with us Eric first um you've done this as one take in effect what made you decide to do it that way\nWell as I was uh doing more than fourteen to use the survivors so many of them really shared their\nFeeling of those seven to ten minutes or ... lost it felt like an eternity\nSo what did you see if I could bring that element into the film almost like a character time itself and that made me decide to try to you know get it all in one single take which altogether last for Ninety four minutes starting like Fifteen minutes before the attack\nAnd I'm I haven't seen it any upset about it I'm told that it's very hard to watch it and to keep breathing it's it's it's breathtaking the tension that you build up\n[noise] yeah well what what ... really necessary for me was to\nTo to sort of a show what happened out there on the oil and not by a telling the perpetrators story but entirely focusing on the victims so\nThat the film is following a Nineteen year old girl through the whole movie the cameras following her all\nThe time and I thought this was important because I Want to just sort of explore and see if we could sort of be able to come the feeling of how it was to be\nTrapped on that island and and if I could raise our empathy towards the victims\nBecause it seems that that we're making movies all the time about those incidents but they're always movies about the perpetrator and I'd never seen a movie made about the victims before so maybe if\nIf that would be the case could that sort of a lead to\nReactions discussion is among those all up and what can we do to prevent this from happening again\nUnless somebody you survived this attack how does the film work will you can you watch it without putting your hands over your eyes\nI watched it for the first time two days ago and I must say that it's a brilliant remade movie at [noise] um I actually felt like every night on the island and ... and\nGet a a brilliant job and it's very hard to watch but it actually felt very very close to reality and I think the way that it's done it must be very difficult to get get so close to the experienced I had and I felt like there today they could anything\nYou've suffered of course with the aftermath and you become a I think a a campaign of for mental health issues is that right\nYeah that's right ... right after a terror attack the I decided to be very open about and my ... and the side and depression and it's something I'm very passionate about to make sure that everyone\nNot only people that I have a terror attack that so many other people are struggling on ... to talk about it and any reaction to something like that and natural reaction and to make sure that people now that\nI Want to ask you to mental health is changed I think is there was an attempt to portray on display because being a mentally ill but that changed didn't it was realized that he he thought he was positive movement Eric\nYeah I mean it's important to remind ourselves that baseball is a political act it was done by a I'm a white I'm mon a right wing extremist and uh it's impose it is it possible to remind us outside\nA fair for terror is focused on people from other cultures baseball ... talk ... talk and um\nIt's yeah that was basically the case I wanted to sort of\nTo lift off but once again a this film compared to the other movie which is also opening up my ... which is about the private sector I really wanted to see if we could bring the audience closer to what happened just by being with the victims\nHow many of you get together at least somebody now those who survived you still encourage each other\n[noise] yes I Do um I actually needs the case I live here full time outside our whenever I'm home and we have a vein you know the uh community and support groups in place and it's um they still have a much in contact\n... been changed this many\n[noise] I think it's important that is nice come out in the debate is for very long time change into\nA nothing about a carrot top that crazy nine and ten cents and stay important that we start talking about that for what he really was a ... attack is it political\nTerror attacks so um I think by bringing us needing to the debate again we can start focusing on what's most important and that's the legacy of the survivors and people who are down ... and what that basic for and values to like hot that day\n[noise] Eric and this what do you think you ... and they somebody who's ... from the film you uh July twenty second and that swelled up they joined us from more tomorrow this is the b._b._c.

I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spin Dell is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us ...\nGood morning thanks for having me or ...\nWhat does the U.S sell this out as exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets ... a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point on the sea one thirty transport plane which that American transport planes right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are up pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that's because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deals for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals I'm about two and a number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely wouldn't be possible and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen us actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel they didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer spend del thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely largely gone along for the ride that may change though this

representatives they could do badly needed oversight on the minister Asians efforts to cater to poll leaders every day over our communities\nThat word oversight is one you hear a lot from Democrats in part because there's not a whole lot else they can do\nMost of the world backs and environmental policy are happening in the executive branch under Trump appointees a shift in house leadership won't change that Democrats can't force interior secretary Ryan Zinke you to restore Bears Ears national monument for example or to crack down on methane emissions but they can force him to explain himself\nArizona congressman role ... is the ranking Democrat on the house natural resources committee\nI Want to change the narrative of this whole thing where the Resources Committee is not just the path of part of the Trump Administration that they're independent and that they have responsibility is co equals for oversight and accountability\nTranslation expect hearings lots of them if Democrats retake the house Tom pile heads the American energy alliance which supports Trump's agenda he says a Democratic majority in the house would be a setback for the administration\nAnd they will be able to tighten up mercilessly so that they\nKinda be able to slow walk a lot of the good work that's being done with respect to these issues\nDemocrats already have a working list here's Colorado

happened in two thousand six when Democrats took back the house under President George W.

April thing Daniels was lying about being threatened in twenty eleven not to go public with their story of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump but in his ruling the federal judge wrote that the tweet quote constitutes rhetorical hyperbole\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples in North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular\nGroup of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nOr was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied or in parts of federal treaties but this is a legal status said political head is not a genetic status and that is very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what Elizabeth Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a try but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAnd then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her\nFamily story um and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of couple\nOf questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAh many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly a extinguished by the government you know states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you're mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country as people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues [noise]\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there and we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it said Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very generous of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat at so I don't think he does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about in Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWell this is an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country are there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nWell in in some ways it's been positively made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for example in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns is at times when there's proposed budgets that reduce things\nAccording to his things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nA education and things of that matter so um we need to we need a federal government that will listen to tribes will control with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nAnd so we think the the British Government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the person the

drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right\nRight exactly so when you go to pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often and ... are made a point of saying that it was probably does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug is five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or\nMy adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scary away from getting a drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grass mine too\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price transparent San Fran scripts and drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you you start companies to be more of a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up to the minute and say in the form it from sickle industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group format and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information

given the Trump administration's approach to trade and other world affairs the other night Leslie stall of CBS sixty minutes asked President Trump about using tariffs on allies\nI mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done well\nObama era treasury secretary Jack Lew just co wrote a piece in foreign affairs about using America's economic power thanks for joining us\nGood to be with you today David now in the title of the piece you assert that Washington is not abusing its financial might I mean what are we doing burning bridges well I think that\nYou know first of all a using your economic power is an effective tool is extremely important as a as a ability to project influence it needs to be protected\nAnd what the piece argues is that we have to be careful and not treat the use of economic power is if it's limitless\nAnd that if we act too much unilaterally if we violate rules that we helped to design if we don't build an international support for our actions there can be a backlash even if it works in the short term can reduce us influence uh overtime\nYou write about what you call secondary sanctions if I can explain that's a bit when the U.S not only bars its own citizens are are companies from doing business with say Iran but the secondary ones kicking barring Americans from doing business with anyone else that does business\nWith the target nation and you think that's particularly the morning when you drill down to that new level\nWhat I'm arguing what we're arguing in the piece is that if somebody has to be as carefully because if you do it when you were\nIn the case of withdrawing from the Iran deal breaking commitment the United states made in spite of the fact that by all evidence Iran complied with the nuclear deal\nOr that raises many questions one will the rest of the world cooperate with you into will the country you're sanctioning change its behavior because of uh the sanctions\nWhich is not say that Iran doesn't do a lot of terrible things uh it's it was a nuclear deal and the secondary sanctions that are going to be re imposing a few days um are being done or not withstanding the fact that all the other signatories to the agreement oppose that action\nIf you hearken back to an earlier era when perhaps the notion\nOf state craft and respecting these international relationships was more front and center\nThere were some problems with the international trading community we ended up with what many on the left or many on the right argues a broken trading system with China maybe the playing according to the rules and making more nice ... wasn't working for people\nWe may well have problems with China I spent a lot of time as secretary taking these issues directly to the Chinese but the way to deal with that is by\nMaking the point that you need to have structural changes in China and you need to do with the the moral leadership of having been both the creator of the rules and complying with the rules of international engagement\nI think that the current tariff policy is not an effective way to do it it's hurting us businesses is hurting us jobs and it's making for the world the impression that the United states is disregarding the rules that we helped to write\nJacob Lew was U.S Treasury secretary for twenty Thirteen to twenty seventies now visiting professor of international public affairs at Columbia

from NPR News\nI'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer a spindle is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joins us from morning\nTo morning thanks for having me or\n... what does the U.S sell this out is exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia on precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement in the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport planes right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and and thinking about the broader political contacts that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama in August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concerned about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable oh\nBecause they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer spend del thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident

encounter with Trump which the president has denied but in his ruling the federal judge wrote that the tweet constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the U.S that is protected by the first amendment\nLet's talk about what it was before and said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people who will say well ah family stories as I Am from India and blood and people who apparently can take a DNA\nAs a does it bother you or when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a try but I have Indian ancestry\nIt does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her\nFamily story um and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nA means by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight to talk about DNA really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nMany of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly extinguished by the government the United states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump has referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should should not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand or issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there and we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat\nSo I don't think he does what he ought to do as the president to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking a senator\nWill miss Roskam thanks very

their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we'd need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right\nRight exactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often um out days are made a point of saying that the list price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example\nBut I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or my adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scary away from getting a drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out um for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price transparent San Fran scripts and drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more of a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up to the minute and say in the form it from sickle industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group format I made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drug and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the farm industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rules comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that [noise]\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame um and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo real world's feels more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi
