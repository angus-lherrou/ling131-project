who vanished also returning to his homeland from from two weeks ago is being investigated took bribery but it's unclear where among whom way is being held or exactly what has been accused of doing this report from a ...\nScenarios in the literature the IT cc is assessed and but just to say the IPC doesn't do its own reception assesses the literature and you'll get boots that the story together there are scenarios\nA thought that will result in solving less than one point five degrees warming bought it involves these radical kind of changes that you know that we talk about it\nIs it economically possible I mean the ... well isn't that to people's livelihoods\nTheir calculations I mean there's not so much a case of increasing investment but switching investments away from things like investment and fossil fuel infrastructure towards investment in low carbon renewable energy energy efficiency electric vehicles are cetera but\nDoes mean that overall energy investments we need to go off to keep within one point five degrees but it does not look as though it's a kind of a showstopper you you know for for economic progress\nCarbon dioxide accumulates and the atmosphere for hundreds of years on we are now living with the consequences of activities that have\nPreviously been taken you use of fossil fuels in the last ... last few decades and even before about and I think the message we go there\nIt is not too late you know one point five degrees can be done within the laws of physics and chemistry but perhaps the most important point is the political will the kind of institutional changes that might be needed to take up the opportunities that are available but that's kind of not for the scientists to do I mean not the message that uh\nWe have taken to the main audience for the port which is the governments that will be meeting in Poland later this year to take the next steps under the framework convention on climate change\nProfessor James ... is a political will exist Mary Robinson is a former president of Ireland and a former un special envoy on climate change she's also author of a book called climate justice\nBut first of all I think we should acknowledge that it was the climate vulnerable countries the least developed countries ... developed in states who insisted on having one point five degrees Celsius in the Paris Agreement that we have to work towards us\nAnd hence the politicians are the scientists office this mean what's the difference between two degrees at one point five we've never had that before we've never had this kind of a wake up call of how serious it is and how we have to do\nA urgently needs to be done in the next eleven years and so that by twenty touchy\nWearing the right position and\nI you know not only did the thunder but countries\nEgg insists and that that would be in the Paris Agreement that they are also the ones that are most ambitious at the moment the Marshall Islands ... made a commitment lost during the U.N General assembly weaker time as we can do you look that they published their twenty fifty\nAnd a agenda which includes net zero emissions\nOr Fiji is about to do the same let me put this way it's the Marshall Islands was on the Security Council this would be the priority it should be and I hope that this report will really encourage at new thinking and new political courage\nBut shouldn't the message be I'm a I'm I'm I'm playing devil's advocate shouldn't message be look it's not just about those low lying island states actually this is about everybody and the consequences if the science is right to ... you know thousands of studies\nThen we ... we all have to act in our own interests\nOh absolutely I couldn't agree more I listen to using the small islands as having secured and we got this good scientific report to show us how serious it\nIs you know what I'm saying is that there isn't that the people just think oh actually you know I I'm not going to change my behavior because we're just talking about if you you know ... remote smoke or you know under populated island for a long way away this doesn't concern me\nAnd that's the value of the scientific report it makes it perfectly clear\nThat and we have only that small window of eleven years to twenty thirty to make sure that we take the necessary steps and they are ambitious and we do have to move out of ... and into clean energy very quickly and it's really important that we do it's and it will be take the steps we take protect\nPoor communities including their land rights civil rights and already we're seeing some abuses in and clean energy being introduced in with big projects that don't consults with indigenous peoples or a ... or a small community\nAnd from a climate justice point of view this really is the reports we'd been waiting for to warn us that's two degrees is dangerous that the we must stay at one point five to have a safe world for our children and grandchildren it's kind of ... humanity\nThere isn't though as far as I can see there isn't the political will to do that at the moment I mean it's it's just not what's being talked about it said\nWell I'm going to king that women worldwide wake up do we want to say for for our children and grandchildren it's urgent us and we have a window of time when we can and should take the measure is necessary and they all do it but it's quite clear from the report their do both but they require\nGreat political will and solidarity\n[noise] Mary Robinson former Irish president and all sorts out

happened first of all it's the first time that the opposition was able to build a coalition although it was very last minute because Mr cable not\nAgreed to consider is oh to to vote for a while they come to an RC and secondly I think it's important to talk about the role of of ecology and and social media every scene that citizenship express itself also on line and probably will help understand better some of the era get\n... that are alleged since yesterday after the voting a had a the counting had begun\nBit more of those ... so familiar with ... the separatist insurgency in those ... votes having on the country\nYeah they have had a very negative impact on the country and on the election festival\nCitizens in those parts of the country have not been able to ... not the greatest number of being able to vote a mainly due to accept courage is threatening citizens or not to go to vote on the one hand and on the other hand\nThe government has not been able and the ... elections

and and thousands of these states citizens who have fled that that the ... the\n... region and I'm thinking specifically of citizens who are now establishing young they were glad that we're not accommodate it to be able to vote despite not being station whether what the pope initially to vote and this is a kind of thing because on the on the other hand the president of the ...\nWho was supposed to go in Yemen date but who is currently here in Paris was allowed to go at the embassy and they just quite shocking so at the different ... that have had a\nHuge impacts the voter turnout was very no I'm not talking about only fifty percent of people went to vote but nevertheless ...\nAnd again they have been very interesting dynamic at the difficulty\nFrom that part of the opposition which I've set up some of them some of the the summit the upcoming transfer all for the future of Cameron\nJudy will have to leave it there but thank you very much and we'll await versus a final results today I Want to come earning journalist stuck in Paris [noise]\nThis is my fifth year since the end of the Spanish civil war was victory for the forces of general Francisco Franco and his message from the school says\nThe warlords have establishment of a dictatorship but then he came to an end in the late Nineteen seventies but there's never really been a proper reckoning for the ... coolest or might be trying to confront some of the divisions was a playwright has a son to see me step over and it's popular play I kind of Maryland when it's been revived into production in London for ...\n[laughter] well let's discuss a little bit about uh there's a first round results and what it means for round two let's to to Syria Booker who's a a correspondence in London for Brazil's a global ... will come to the program festival you'll reaction to the result\nOf a bit I'm not surprised that he came a hit the right wing ... but I'm surprised at the level of of domination that he had in this person level forty six percent is way up ahead of of what the poster predicted that around thirty thirty two percent\nSo that's quite a wave quite a conservative wave along the lines of a right wing achieving power in many countries I'm just one more yes do you think is driving that\nIn the case of Brazil or several things that the anti corruption feeling in the country is very strong and that is pretty much associated with the with the workers' party which was his main opposition there's the security questions in Brazil has been suffering high levels of\nCrime especially in the big cities you know something like sixty three thousand people were murdered last year this gigantic and when somebody comes around with his background which is a military background\nPromoting hard line on law and order and promote promoting easy solutions to those problems there there's there's quite an appeal to that\nDid for them to do better than expected that\nHe went up as well in relation to the west the posters were indicating beforehand but one thing we have to keep in mind both candidates have a very high level of rejection in other words people who say I'll never vote for one or the other you know depending on what camp there\nAnd the the big question now is where we'll do voters that went for the other candidates who were half a dozen more will vote in the second round\nYes and listen to a little bit about that second random you know there are enough people opposed to both of those some brand of politics to stop him over the mount unstoppable fools\nI Would say he he's got the so called momentum at the ... among the wave that is going with them that would favor him but it's it's still a big question mark or how the others will vote\nOr the people who voted for the other half a dozen candidates how will be split and that as we can see from these numbers ... just a tiny bit to reach the fifty percent plus one vote that he needs to win outright so\nIn in general I Would say he is he's got a better chance to win a prize\nSo many things to joining us this morning suitable can enter a correspondence among for Brazil's global news we can also talk now to do if you're going to lead them out to see me Electra in sociology major City University here in London who are\nOn the phone and the documents just welcome to the program your reaction to the ... do you think that to both to another to do much much better than people expected\nAnd well I was already expecting it so similarly to what Sylvia has mentioned um there is no surprise in in this election in terms of how many votes he has caught and they were just a few things to highlight first um it's not possible to include in other right wing fourth but basically it comes very much on an extreme\nRight wing on that platform and also tend to write in in Brazil has actually filmed\nWeakness is represented by the pet sit there and the and that they have tend to go away actually responsible for for for the peace process they are the main loses in this election so what you have is a kind of strange scenario where the ... has actually managed to we kind of a\nWalk off to I'm at the criticisms and and the former Dilma government but to a certain extent it has also not being enough so the big question mark now for the second round is who is going to win obviously I'm\nFrom following from what say that yes both NATO does have a strong that song or we can equate him very much within a tradition of rise of leaders and I'm a\n... a somewhat call him like a tropical version of Trump right so the law and order that they offer coming strongly and and also not just because of corruption they because of a sense of a crisis of democratic representation so a lot of the vote is odds stacked with traditional politicians\nWere not would you would you characterize him as a fascist dizzy that fall to the ...\nOh yes he is he is and uh it's extremely and so basically what we have in the in the last week is the whole world in shock to the possibility that he could win um you have have easily thing not to not realizing an extreme\nOr we tolerate hate could tolerate such a thing that and he would not rape\nSomeone else and particularly also some of his voters shouting to think that would kill homosexuals he also has a loft and joked how he would even show to offend them they got those though and also other opponents and so it's quite shocking that I'm elements from\nThe center right including from the ... they have actually joined fourth\nAnd and and in relation to and so at the moment there is a big question mark because it's also a lot of movement towards that need to maintain\nA civilized and democratic representation in the country which is more towards the center and which will not go towards an extreme form the politics of of hatred\nAnd I'm totally dismissed\nDismissive of other opponents\nWill have to leave without a thank you very much food for your analysis was turning them into a mature in sociology at City University here in in London listening to well updates from the BBC [noise]\n\nChina's says that ah\nThe former head of Interpol who vanished often returning home to China from from two weeks ago is being investigated for bribery but it's unclear where men home way is being held or exactly what he's accused of doing that with me in

dissipate a couple of weeks ago he was on a flight back to a homeland from France and where he lives with his wife and child is that what he was he was head of the Interpol that\nUm and at simply vanished ... on Sunday evening they turn Sunday evening to change that so much is indicated that he being invested now we've got a little bit more detail about the bribery charges\nThere was a little bit more set in the press release issued by the public security ministry in China saying that investigation to him was why correct and timely suggesting uh they've already decided he's guilty of those ...\nAlleged crimes and an extraordinary story surely they\nTell us a bit more about him how does he fit into the the hierarchy of the Communist Party I mean ... before he became head of into president Vince ...\nWell it was interesting in the statement issued by the public security ministry it was quite long rambling as often these press at least she or he mentioned he's connection to a at previous head all of the ministry and I'm coach Joe Young can\nWho was at prosecuting these currently in prison for grad where he was one scene is\nPresident Xi Jinping's a\nRival that within the highest echelons of the company's policy now at ... home way in these press releases linked to this cat and\nThe suggestions of a political loyalties so ...\nDoes that leave some indication that ... all ... about breaking the law that need some kind of a political problem as well in in China he's often the case at two things at go together\nMichael thank you very much orange Pacific as a micro first so what else will start to to ... trying to research firm I'm a singer national base in Hong Kong facts for being with us what are your concerns about this case\nI'm I'm very much concerned about the way to you know the hot seat is up they are now being safe even much\nMore about the little so uh we don't see any procedure like what would happen to him according to like what the current law of the national\nA supervisory commission and actually working for up to six months um but the snow or disclose show about ... about ... and also a way that he has ... so he's very a voting like what were the procedure is located\n[noise] yes I'm I'm particularly about what we were just hearing from from up Michael ... they've already seemed to have made their minds up\nIt clear that actually is not just to see him pull corruption case is very much related to some other issues\nBut then like a ... like a reduced you don't know like what would be the criminal procedure will be played against him\nAnd the parties actually been like according to ... a whole team pull up to six months of getting any criminal charges against him so because of the new system called knew that was\nWe pay 'em that like the previous system I'm\nI'm most his criticism of the Saudi Government to I'm On the changes that you outlined ... was driven by principals or was it because he perhaps felt that he was being shot house in a way that he hadn't been before in other words he was given those micro she was quite close and that actually he was just he'd be sidelined a few like\nNo I think his his motive I mean we talked about that I think he's most who was a genuine one I think he was a someone who spoke his mind he was not a ... to make things up\nHe would be very he'd always knock down some of my theory is awesome my walls or stories and say none of the day but that's not what happened it was like this he's very very concerned about the truth but he was also had a deep love for his country I didn't think\nHe was in it for personal gain or he felt particularly shots out I think he felt\nHe he told me seriously if he thought that his country was in the process of being on prompted\nI think he ... he was a patriot\nWho really cares deeply about his country\nI mean he supported a the Saudi pushback against to Iran sent me and suddenly it in Yemen but he simply he comes to the\nUh pointed out the contradictions all saying uh your boss he women's rights by by long to drive and then uh looking up that she complained and he was constantly\nSaying that he had a lot of

month ten percent tariffs on two hundred billion dollars more in Chinese products\nThe terrorists are cutting into Chinese exports so the government is trying to give the economy a shot in the arm by getting banks to make more loans\nNow in the U.S the Senate banking committee held hearings last week about something seems to me ... similar changing reserve requirements here right\nThat's right the Dodd Frank financial reform law made banks set aside more capital so they have a bigger financial cushion but there's a new law exempting some midsized banks from the toughest provisions of Dodd Frank

show and uh never came out and they waited for for twelve hours and then and never came out\nSo far a what we know I'm again is is basically the accounts of conflicting accounts that the Turkish and\nSaudi official the Saudis are categorical nine um that they had a anything to do with any sort of kidnapping or or killing and that he left the conflict um on his own traditions are saying that they have evidence or that they\nBelieve that um he was a murdered a killed 'em so right now we don't have proof positive either scenario whether he's alive or dead and makes it even more hard

just wanted to write he didn't want to be a dissident who didn't want to get opposition figure he just wanted to be afraid to express what he thought was his version of the truth about that area is
