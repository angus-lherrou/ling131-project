[noise] um\nI think it's also worth mentioning is that initially the plane was put on ... separatist groups\nAnd one group did specifically come out and say that they were responsible for it not themselves who are based in Denmark but their group inside um Iran and Iraq was responsible and that they had not given the okay\nSo that's very interesting to note but at the same time the Iranian government has been putting the blame on the U.S Saudi Arabia Israel and the United Arab Emirates and they've been saying that they've been back in the separatist groups\nAnd that they've been backing ISIS so what this attack supposedly according to what we've been reading on state media is that they were attacking text theory terrorists which is essentially another word for ISIS\nAnd it seems that these were I'm focusing on ISIS strongholds in Syria and this is exactly what happened in June two thousand and Seventeen when they did a similar launch in Syria\n[noise] total submitted by the ... national resistance this movement the once as we started to split Iran all the ...

Rob\n... I should maybe just quickly sent that into context I mean basically what he was saying he's a very much a pro Brexit air and self Dominic Rob was that look if you were to deny if you have another referendum in this country about Brexit that would be to sort of deny the will of the people and that could lead to populism and he was saying if you um\nYou know if you don't think you could of populism in this country look at what happened to the opposition Labour Party going from being a moderate policy on the German under Tony Blair to what we have today and that's why you joined us anyway I guess if I was to sum it up close to sum it up there and I would say that's a you know essentially the conservative poses no exaggeration\nIs at war over ... I mean there's just no two ways about that you feel that at every meeting that you go to one set of wing of the conservative ... regards Brexit\nAs something which will have a terrible consequences economically if handled badly could keep the apology out of power for a generation where you go to another branch of the policy of infuse yesterday about ... like Mr Rob and you'd think that the prime minister herself is just not grabbing it with enough enthusiasm\nI spoke to a new ... does it she's the investigative journalist from Slovenia who decided that this was worth investigating I also why\nShortly the subject is in my view should be a part of um freedom of information\nAct requests and is considered public information for example in city near our lawn freedom of information explicitly states that such information so that I'm totally budget to exercise a public duties are all public information basically\nWhen we started this project three years ago um that was sort of the focus of the initiatives\nAnd we're talking about considerable amounts of money here members of the European parliament's get more than four thousand euros every month for what's called general expenditure allowance which is to get offices and so on and that's about the same and do this full thousand US dollars and they don't have to account for\nNo they don't actually the European Parliament admitted to us during the process of trying to access information of public importance that they do not cold any documents on this allowance therefore we ran our own investigation\nInto these national offices that are supposed to be funded from these four thousand and some you know and we found that around a third of the any peace as offices and our national states\nWhere non existent or they could not locate them so that means at least a third of the any peace is was abusing 'em ... of spending for this generally senator allowance\nRight so there's these four thousand dollars just going somewhere nobody knows where what do you think they are doing with it\nWell it depends it depends on who you ask some any peace publish these expenses even for general expenditure allowance in some shape or form on their own websites\nSome at any peas refused to disclose what they're doing with this money\nHad instances where an any peace said that um he was saving money for old age an ... said that he donated this money to his national party\nTo stop you there and there's 'cause there's no legal is it does not\nKnow that is all against the rules the documents on expenses that we are asking are trying to access all pertain exclusively to the exercise of public mandates of the any peace but they're all meant to be spent exclusively on such cost not on personal matters\nSo why did the court of justice solve the European Union say that you and other journalists simply didn't have the right to to look at what is public money on holds people's spending it to account\nBecause they're convinced that the state that belongs to the any peas and as their personal data richest at odds with any and all principles of public spending if this is indeed private date of the any peace then there's something very wrong with this public spending\nI Know screw you think wouldn't chew the bearing in mind the discussions on Brexit and so on one of the reasons that people in Britain said they didn't like the European Union was because they would do with money you'd think they get the point\nYeah I Would think so too but unfortunately this decision of the European Court of justice came at the worst possible time with far right sentiment rising and skepticism rising and getting stronger and stronger this was indeed a ... in in you know sort of Europe's own foot\nThe investigative journalist ... ... we just want her to tell you this uh international editor at least to set speaking to the un special envoy for Yemen mountain Griffiths\nBut I think it was incredibly important for the UN to issue that warning but it tells us something profoundly worrying about Yemen which is that a situation in which is always ready to was to monitor a catastrophe

agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do it seemed as if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction they these are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity prosperity which they fulfill themselves as individuals as groups\nIn every possible way that any American or British press that our Chinese person wouldn't\nWell Palestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces the demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that if the Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when the two states rather than going into the label I'd like to talk about my view of a potential agreement with the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power for\n... power that must not be in their hands is the question of security in the tiny area was to the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about\nThe width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're both Palestinians and Israelis blue Israel must return the overarching security responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd the basically a militant Islam came in under\nBy law observing to Iran or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them off so if you have a state that have most of sovereign state\nBut not the our security is the other food or not I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position a bit of very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration under the Trump\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel said some days ago some weeks\nOh what a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he\nSays now you're not willing to put the state label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is it's not an either or model I think we have a third model very leave which is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones that security look in the middle east which are littered with failed states\nThat's often the best you can do\nAnd what did you try to do something of you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel\nBut you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads side of the question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form that take\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government going flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah engineering or novels are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best way we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power but I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't feel that much terrorism and that was back well first of all we up security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was\nA it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about terrorists in one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because\nBecause we're willing to take the within attack as we were at the un by President Abbas\nSo they want us to take care of their security but they also you know attack of\nFight internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you've got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel have had a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you feel that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we had\nYou know it's no secret an avid disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we've signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the\nComing decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you'd have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nBy minister and that and you know it's always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much\nFactors do good to talk to\nIsrael's Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to join us and that invitation\nRemains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI'm John Kerry first entered the public arena as a clinic Vietnam War happened my Senate seat at presidential nomination of John secretaries part and the Texas Tribune evil in Austin Terry joined us to talk about his life in public service and the state of American diplomacy next time on things and\nThink Jim joy this afternoon at one Houston Public media news eighty eight seven\nI'm Peter O'Dowd sky high housing prices are partly to blame for a wave of homeless students overwhelming schools in Washington state\nThere are families that Chinese including all night because they don't want to be identified there said if they tell anyone that they're living in hiring children will be taken away and then that's next time on here in now\nAnd human now comes the way this afternoon it to Houston Public media news eighty eight seven\nNot eat ... mosque so they're going to try to make them be about is boring and bland is most CEO's here's my question David well at work because it's not going to be a twenty four hour a day babysitter it's wet mosque is supposed to do and will mosque ever do what he's supposed to do I do know\nAlways good to talk to Eric Gordon at the University of Michigan's Ross school of business thank you my pleasure David\nTesla's stock which plunged on friday is up Eighteen percent in free market trading this morning another stock way up this morning in pre market action is General Electric up Fifteen Percent on news a new CEO will replace the one that was there just about a year\nIn his H.

Steve Inskeep we've been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven more\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do seem to if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides will get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less some Palestinians had been ...\nIs Palestinian analysts dizzy and saying told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction they\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity prosperity and which they fulfilled themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American or British press that our Chinese person wouldn't wild\nPalestinians today I have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces the demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that if the Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they are two states going into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement as the Palestinians should be able to\nHave all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us the Cape power the must not be in their hands is the question of security in the tiny area was\nTo the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty ... kilometer mhm where both Palestinians and Israelis live Israel must return to the overarching security responsibility otherwise we'll good what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left and basically militant Islam came in\nUnder by law observing to Iran or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them or do we do if you have a state that have most of sovereign state but not the our security is the other state or not if I don't know you can argue about that\nThat aren't my position I bet it very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration under the Trump and\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago when a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state label the independence state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is it's not an either or model I think we have\nA third modeling very leave which is uh basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which are littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something of you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel\nBut you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to the question are you willing to support a proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form of that tank\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government going flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nIf you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin or no blue governed by the Senate but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger is\nNot this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so I think we have to be realistic as long as we\nThe middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violent thoughts radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding bar and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't feel that much terrorism and that was back well first of all we all ... to cooperation with the Palestinian authority\nThat's good I'm going out with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off but here's how it's done we have intelligence about terrorists\nIn one of the Palestinian town and we would call up typically I'm up in ... for water to take care of it 'cause I don't want to fund our soldiers there we don't have to oh why should we you know and often we have to do because\nBecause we're willing to take the within attack as we ... the\nUn by a bus so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I I understand\nI Do final thing you have been very closely allied with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk and being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel they've had a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in the future it's powerful bond\nThere there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you feel that we could of agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we had you know it's no secret of out of\nDisagreement with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we've signed\nAn animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding going through those are all a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have this agreement for the ... have a basic agreement about the importance of our live\nPrime minister Netanyahu was always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much\nFactors do good to talk to\nIsrael's Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has joined us and that invitation remains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI'm Peter O'Dowd sky high housing prices are partly to blame for a wave of homeless students overwhelming schools in Washington state\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified their fate if they tell anyone that they're living in their car their children will be taken away some then that's next time on here and now\nHere and now comes the way this afternoon it to use the public media news eighty eight seven\nSupport comes from the calm right chamber music ... pianist Aaron Diehl explores really American piano and the ingredients and the creation of John how to operate twelve hobby center tickets for the camera dot com\nAnd support comes from Texas oncology with a reminder that October is breast cancer awareness month\nTo aid early detection all women over the age of forty should undergo routine screenings like yearly mammograms more taxes on ... dot com and support comes from half price books honoring teachers and librarians dedicated to inspiring students and awakening the imagination", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "01"}
