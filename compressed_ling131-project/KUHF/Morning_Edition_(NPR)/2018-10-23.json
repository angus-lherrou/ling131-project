T brother is the head of the middle east and North Africa program at the Chatham House international says think tank\nUh here in London what you make of what he has said so far\nUm activity around that not drop the bomb that some expected him to drop today which just eating the naked truth if anything he has said that the turkey will continue to investigate the case but also said that he is looking for a similar investigation\nHopping on the south side mainly the Eighteenth suspect so it seems to me is that uh we are not going to hear the naked truth anytime soon and that turkey is continuing uh trying to pressure Saudi Arabia but I'm not saying it's all the way to the\n[noise] so I mean there was an expectation um today that uh we might hit the audience\nI'm evidence see the video evidence or perhaps and the president do to might be rather more explicit him pointing a finger at crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but none of those things happen [noise]\nNo not told a there has been no sharing of all the evidence or visual evidence and he did not really you mentioned the crown prince I'm In his speech either um in fact he praised uh the king will how are you know have not been shot announce father\nI'm not so it seems to me that a negotiations behind closed doors are likely to be happening um because otherwise um I think adults on could have been able to push this a lot further than he has so he is still giving Saudi Arabia bits of our way out\nHaving said that he did say that he believes that murder um was premeditated um at the same time said that the explanation given so far\nUh is not satisfactory ah so um I think the key thing as a ... as far as effectively blaming a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman or no further down the line so far it looks like he is going to stop short of doing that\nBut as of now I'm In very broad terms um there is not a great divergence between what turkey has been saying about this killing about Saudi Arabia or see turkey giving a lot more detail up both countries now agreeing that he was murdered\nSuch a this was conducted by a group that came from Saudi Arabia to turkey the principal got Dutch and so is or was this a authorized by crown prince or was it a a rogue operation\nYes absolutely and this is Vegas how close that President added on seems to be preserving\nThrough his remarks today because he did not go as far as even saying that uh someone high up uh in the royal family meeting the crown prince or they can't\nUh maybe responsible so I'm all we have is a divergence in terms of uh actually details\nBut the key culprit is yet to be confirmed and this is um you know what really makes me believe that a turkey at least so\nFar does not want to antagonize Saudi Arabia too much in this matter\n[noise] being emitted thinks that that was a being a cut the head of the middle east and North Africa program at the Chatham House international affairs has a think tank in London and still

having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement and it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John wolf style is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around to is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly\nIncreasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other which sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could they used to grow it\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on a national security council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia is developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatening to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia is building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal had it under the Obama administration\nTo get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a

cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen glamour good news more than capable not only playing catch up on a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nIt and there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and you say John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending

inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons um\nTremendous races there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nUm but if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows up even more than it

Detrow is in Studio with us this morning Scott good morning morning I some in terms of two weeks away how is this message including that use of the word nationalist likely to play with Republican voters well this has been President Trump\nInstinct all along to play up immigration fears going into the mid term at one point he hinted that he wanted to see a government funding shut down over that border wall in the fall\nCongressional leaders in the Republican side have wanted to focus on that strong economy but President Trump sees this type of immigration and crime really fear mongering as key to his presidential election and he's never felt the need to do anything but wrap up his core\nBase of course we should point out the key races that are probably going to decide control of the house aren't being played out in the Trump based part of the country there in the suburbs and high income high education areas where this doesn't really play as well\nYou've been out on the campaign trail in in recent weeks how often are you seeing illegal immigration come up and and how often does it come up in the kind of tone that the president was using in Texas\nSure well I was actually in some western states last week covering a Senate race in Nevada and a key house race in Utah and there are a lot of immigrants there and a lot of people sympathetic to immigrants and President Trump's approach really isn't too popular and in those places Democrats are very happy to have this discussion\nCriticize his decision to try to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program criticizes policy\nOf separating families who entered the country illegally a\nJacky Rosen Democrat running for Senate in Nevada really talked about this a lot saying that she would try to stop all those policies but does it does it motivate democratic voters\nI I I think it does but I think go back to how President Trump to the world you know he views himself as occupying the White House he sees that this was a key thing that he talked about twenty sixteen that worked in his mind he's a very successful president so\nHe's going to try and keep doing that over and over again\nI think it's valuable whatever your views of immigration might be to get a couple of numbers on the table the president has talked a lot about this caravan an estimated seven thousand people\nOr some of whom will head toward the United states based on past caravans they'll seek legal entry we're in a point in history where the number of legal permanent residents admitted to the U.S each year is over one million the number of people stopped at the border\nThe southwestern border each month is thirty five to forty thousand this a few thousand people is not actually a significant changes significant flow of people it's not overwhelming the country at all although it is a dramatic human story\nAnd we should say than the past caravans like this when they get to the border they present themselves at ports of entry and apply for asylum they're not storming the border like the president suggesting\nNPR's Scott Detrow Scott thanks so much they keep\n\nPresident Trump says he plans to end a thirty year old arms control treaty with Russia this treaty that helped to mark the end of the Cold War\nYeah he's a national security adviser John Bolton to Moscow where he's scheduled to meet president Vladimir Putin's today trashing the treaty is a sign that world powers could be returning to an arms race mentality\nNPR's Geoff Brumfiel is with us in Studio ... he's been reporting on this new class of missiles that could help to define that race they're known as hyper sonic weapons good morning Geoff and good morning what is a hyper sonic weapon\nWell the first thing to say is it is not covered by this arms control treaty or actually any treaty because it's still in the research and development phase\nBut essentially this is a weapon that can go very very fast five times the speed of sound or more and not only that but it can fly like an airplane so this is an incredibly fast potentially very stealthy weapon that can sort of maneuver around defenses to strike it's target so\nKind of a worrying weapons if weapons or something you worry about weapons are always worry that you've been to the air force is testing sites how far along are countries in actually producing these these kind of weapons\nRight so I went to one of the Air Force's wind tunnels where they're doing some prototyping and I actually can't tell you much because the morning I showed up I got a text message\nThey told me a we're doing classify testing today we won't let you in but they did let me talk to some of the people there and what I can say is that they are definitely increasing the pace of testing and um\nThey're not the only ones the Chinese and Russians are also doing a lot of testing China did a test back in August Russia was talking about its tests earlier this year\nThis is a weapon that appears to be on the fast track at least among the world powers\nI mean that brings up a really interesting question right is are we seeing the beginning of of a kind of knew arms race\nI think well I'm Mike Griffin who's the head of the Pentagon's R and D a sort of division was was talking about ... weapons last month and this is what he had to say about it\nWe did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize that we need to respond\nAnd the day there is China and Russia so basically I mean that does sound a bit like an arms race to me we started it they're keeping to do it so we gotta keep going\nUm you know I think that this is a case of everyone is investing heavily in a new weapons technology and it's not the only case Russia's developing a lot of new systems right now some of which are pretty wild\nCan I just ask what is the point of a hyper sonic weapon a missile that gets to its target even faster is adjust that missile defenses which don't always work anyway would work even less with a super fast weapons\nWell exactly I mean this is a good question arms control expert said there isn't much point in the U.S developing when we already have a lot of capabilities\nUm China and Russia are definitely just perennially worried about missile defense and so they see it as a way to get around us missile defenses especially in the future is our missile defenses grow more sophisticated\n... NPR's Geoff Brumfiel thanks so much thank you [noise]\nAlright Saudi Arabia is still trying to get it story straight on what exactly happened to journalist ...

say that Turkey's president has disclosed everything he knows about the murder of a journalist but ... has put definite accusations on the record today\nHe's addressing a meeting of his ruling party he's been talking of the death of democracy choked you walked into a Saudi consulate in Turkey on October second and never emerged\nEveryone says this death was a premeditated killing by Saudi Arabia ... native nation which his writings criticized\nThe Saudi Government first said it knew nothing of his disappearance and then said show she died in a fight and that it is still investigating NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul Hi there Peter ... so what evidence is there to one put on the table\nWell ... says the evidence that they have so far strongly suggests that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nOr one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scout it out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including a forest in northeast is ... ah and then he also ah in his remarks called Henri odd\nOr to allow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death to be prosecuted in Turkey or they have all gone back to Riyadh or Saudi Arabia so they would have to be extradited\nUm the Turkish president also says this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate another properties to be searched\nAnd why has the Saudi explanation of what happened changed so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was at a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or was the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did aired on confirming any of the other various news reports about bits of damning information\nWell probably the biggest thing that has come out so far in anonymous ah reports from investigators is the claim of a audio possibly even video evidence to back up the the Saturday investigation into the claim it looked into the Saturday involvement in this\nI'm no official has said on the record that that tape exist or no one has denied it and so that that still remains unresolved\nWhy would it be the president of turkey personally giving us information about this as opposed to a prosecutor investigator some lower level officials\nWell up its big as the basic answer I mean the world attention to this has been huge there's no sign of it fading aired on has decided that he needs to be involved and be seen to be involved he was a pains in his remarks today to assure people there will be no cover up\nA and this is although at the same time we have to notice a joint investigation with the Saudis that has raised some eyebrows are so far investigators do have shown no sign of going easy on ...\nWell is the one who is no fun\nUh I don't know I'm a I'm a little bit on the\nUh I I don't know that one I'm not sure I was thinking of

New Jersey there\nIs a caravan of several thousand Central American migrants moving through Mexico some of whom I may reach the United states in the broad sweep of immigration it's not that big an issue but President Trump through tweets and rally speeches as making sure everybody knows about it\nThat is an assault on our country [noise]\n\nAnd then you have some very big [noise] you have some very bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country\nThe president offered no evidence for that claim nor did the White House back it up as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports his statements are no accident\n[noise]\nCancer build the wall roared inside the Houston arena where President Trump rallies the faithful last [noise]\nRecent days the caravan of migrants has become a key feature of Trump's rallies speeches Democrats are to blame he says and Republicans of course will be the saviors\nWe will sanctuary cities [noise]\n\nCatch and release a lot of migration out [noise]\nAnd we will keep the criminals drug dealers or jurors that hell out of our country [noise]\nGo back to twenty Fifteen and the day Trump rode an escalator in Trump Tower into the race for president and his rhetoric is little changed\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some\nI assume are good people he was asked about those comments in twenty sixteen in a sworn deposition and trucks response reveal something about how he sees immigration as a political tool\nIllegal immigrants is illegal and I and there is a very big topic in this country\nAnd which is a topic that you know has led to my nomination in a major party in the country\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that your tried to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem with partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a ...\nGrab one that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their batch\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will\nBe at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and he'd earls\nWho's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won the Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWindy low [noise] they go low\nWe what did you mean or what I meant ... in that remark was at a I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think through votes through protests um I I must say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration and it was very powerful when young people marched here in Washington\nTo ask for more saying gun safety measures those are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves attorney general holder thanks so much ... thank you [noise]\nAll right Steve the mega

founder of Gen forward or regular scientific survey that pays special attention to the race and gender of respondents professor Hi\nHello David ... get used to know a comedian who had the ... discuss some problem any problem and then ask what's my point more money for education you would say is the answer to every single problem that's in a sense what you found when the question is education\nI think that is true clearly millennials have has seen his routine when we ask young people any number of questions about the best way to improve public education they always circle back to increasing funding for public education so they want to pay teachers more\nThey want to invest in a neighborhood schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do gleaned data based on the race of the responded in the gender what what did you find in Missouri a difference depending on who was answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extend across race and ethnicity and how would\nYour respondents use the money if there were more money for education\n[noise] well they do a number of different things right there is a clear sense and the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education\nIs through really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money they want to give it to teachers they want to support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also talking about the charter school movement\nYeah it's complicated I guess I Would say in the sense that young people are looking to improve education so they're supporting any number of strategies\nThey are supportive of increasing the number of charter schools\nThey are supportive of

of journalist ... ... spoke to Turkey's parliament this morning it\nIs as it was not going to satisfy I don't know the um the nation from really the justice fresh in my\nField or to one also said that he has clear evidence that the killing was premeditated Saudi officials meanwhile now say that ... was killed in a rogue operation by individuals who are acting without the knowledge of the crown prince\nThey first said that he left the consulate in Istanbul alive now all of this back and forth has prompted many U.S officials to question the relationship between\nThe U.S in Saudi Arabia one of those officials as Congressman Adam Schiff he's a Democrat in California and he's the ranking member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence\nRepresentative shifted winning could more to go to be with you so what did we learn in are the ones who remarks today\nWe learned that the Turks have additional details or only some of which they've shared with the public about the premeditated nature of this killing or that the team actually didn't all had over the same time that part of the team won over earlier and may have done reconnaissance and are forced to determine where to dispose of the body\nThey brought within the body double their images of that body double in the show she's close so they give a lot of added detail but they still withheld the some of the key evidence that they claimed to have which is a either audio or video recordings of of the killing\nDoes what are the one said today square with what you've been told by the U.S intelligence community\nIt certainly far more credible than the Saudi account um but you have to say that the the Turks don't come to this with clean hands are after all this is the same country now demanding extradition of this team from Saudi Arabia\nThat had a team of its own security thugs beat up people in the streets of Washington DC and refuse to extradite them a turkey is also the leading jailer of journalists and the world so it's not as if they're the champions of democracy and human rights in a press freedom but still they're count is far more credible than that of the Saudis\nYou believe there are a reliable source in this case\nI certainly believe that um their account a seems much more consistent with what we know what can be proven but there's still a lot we don't know a still a lot we're taking the Turks word for and we need to get to the bottom of this uh obviously the most\nPointed question is does the trail laid back to the deputy crown prince was this\nAn order to either capture or kill to bring him back either in one piece or multiple pieces depending on whether he's willing to come back to Saudi Arabia\nCIA director Gina Haspel flew to turkey yesterday what is she doing there\nWell I Would assume that she went to get a preview of what the um a prime minister the Turkish prime minister was going to say a and also to request to a review or whatever audio tapes or additional evidence that they have so that she could come back and brief the president\nOf this is what took place or the Saturday account is either believable or or completely ... unbelievable\nBut I assume that she's going to get the best information to provide to I Hope not only the president but also policymakers in Congress that left to determine the response\nLet's not in this out to the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia which is\n... it's it's complicated and you are regionally in favor of the Saudi led coalition in Yemen in two thousand in Fifteen which has been responsible for killing tens of thousands of civilians with the help us American weapons now that includes children has your position on this coalition changed\nIt has changed and certainly changed to before the ... the murder it did Oh yes I think initially the Saudis are were intent on pushing back though who these who were trying to take over the country dreaded oppose uh the legitimate government in Yemen\nA and we're getting around and help to do it but we've seen over the course of time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm a willing to allow a civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately uh we shouldn't be providing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think a re examination certainly of our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... murder does also is\nIt tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just a piece of Yemen but is this really um the country we want to paint her entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to a relationship with because after a on the basis of so\nThis I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond well\nSaudi Arabia is human rights abuses are not anything new in and the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House during the Obama administration\nWell it you know not concerned you know I mean certainly we hoped that uh the new ... the new crown prince would\nBring about changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia and it certainly at times he has made nod set towards a reform ah and that looked encouraging a Saudi Arabia has been an important ally\nBut that doesn't mean that we accept everything they do and critically and where of their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more civilian civilian casualties we can and must a push back a and certainly not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt innocent people\nSo they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for our foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia I\nWe certainly can push for deep examination of intelligence related to this incident but Saudi Arabia more generally that should have bipartisan support the certainly the comments in reaction to the shows you murder have been very critical and very bipartisan as they should be\nRepresentative Adam Schiff thank you so much for joining us\nThank you President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow for a second day to day he's there to discuss President Trump's pledge to withdraw from an arms control treaty that ban certain kinds of missiles this is one sign that world powers might be returning to an arms race mentality [noise]\nNow we have another sign efforts by the United states China and Russia to develop a new kind of missile a weapon that can fly faster and farther than almost anything in existence NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the latest\nThese weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour\nThe air force is currently developing high percentage of weapons including at a place called wind tunnel number nine just outside of Washington DC was a good way in\nThe morning I showed ... who's in charge said the test they were running that day were classified I wasn't going to get inside no not at this point but I was allowed in the lobby of the wind tunnel building [noise]\nTheir marriage showed me unclassified version of\nThe things they work on so if you look on this table here we have several of the shapes that we've tested in the window among the models as a sleek silver wed with a spine down to center it was called a wave rider and so it's a fancy way to say rides on its own shock wave\nHere's how the wave rider works the wedge shaped warhead would be put on top of a rocket and fired at enormous speeds to the very edge of space then it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes but those missiles just going to straight line\nFrom launched to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space but people to turn and bank and in a fly almost like a real airplane and\nThat's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable [noise]\nBack in August China tested the hypocenter prototype that flew for more than five minutes it reached beads about four thousand miles per hour according\nTo state media Russia to has been testing and the missile defense roundtable last month the Pentagon's head of research and development Mike Griffin said he was worried the u._s. was losing its ad\nWe did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize it we need to respond\nThat's twenty five cents a pound and that works out to about twenty five dollars a day and an average year these nuts would have been headed to China not this year and now because of the weather but because of the U.S China a trade war\nThat I Know that we can supply what\nThey're still money to be made in a group of far younger trees though it didn't\nEscape damage [noise] thousands of these trees\nCut down to still Bolger says the younger trees are the long term future of the panel plantation but in the short term\nYet those lean years coming ahead of us and we'll we'll work around\nWhich Bolger says that means re planting intending and waiting for decades
