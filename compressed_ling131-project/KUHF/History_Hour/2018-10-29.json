will deliver his budget it comes after the British prime minister Theresa May promised an end to austerity after eight years of ... is here from our business desk and begin are we expecting a big spending budget for Britain them\nWell as you say shine that Theresa May the conservative party conference last month declared to much fanfare that austerity is that after eight years of cuts in public spending and they were phrases in public sector wages in sleeping ... as the seven since the ... at a local government level\nBut the prime minister said that thanks to all that belt tightening that will be better days ahead this afternoon in parliament allies will be on finance minister Philip Hammond he's known as the chance to see if he can deliver on that promise kind of MSN from the Institute the fiscal studies here in London says it would be easy\n... becoming very difficult to ... somebody wants him to ... um but he also has a commitment to trying to eliminate the budget deficit I'm so used to have normal government boring from about the mid twenties ...\nAnd the situation is in is in the last financial ... boring was around ... billion pounds\nAnd so it was full costs to come down over the next few years but because of cuts to spending so on the one hand you want to not be cutting spending because we want to induce territory but on the other hand he needs the deficit to come down until then she be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it fully going\n... juggling act for finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting a more money the public services particularly mental health services as well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to boost of Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it needs to be you\nYes and Mr Hammond is expected to tell and pays today that the really big decisions on public spending can only be made one suspects that deal has been done and Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as kind of innocent says we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe government's focus so far been predicated on a kind of old Elise move Brexit it's under the case if we have a very disruptive breaks it so for example there's no deal made with the European Union and we just ... to trade on WTO terms that would be hugely damaging in the short run\nWhich is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nNow what are the search and rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations when these kinds of tragedies in disasters strike in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found\nA debris from the aircraft as well as things that they are possessions that they believe belonged to those on board\nAh they've described things like ... safety jackets um other sorts of possessions but at this point they still haven't found any survivors and obviously the focus is very much on trying to find anybody who may have survived the plane crashed they've also sent helicopters to scour the seas\nAre in the nearby areas to look for any people ah but at this point all that they can tell us is that the search and rescue operation is continuing and they're sending more vessels and helicopters to the area\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to uh to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading any anything into this as a as to the cause of the crash well a time of\nWhat they do say that they can confound the cause of the ... crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they\nAre looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meat is into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he found that lived at so no official confirmation of this analysis I I have to add something in what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed with the water out it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance or in the from from the point that it took off now\nAt those reports that you were talking about the fact that the uh\nAircraft pilot and I should say at had asked to turn around soon after takeoff\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will receive really an reveal more information about why this happened\nAnd encouragement give us an idea when do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take a shining to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia\nA few years ago covering up the crash of ally in air flight a witch and landed which crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact at the there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nAh the safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty uh to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that lion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested\nIn safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any further survivors any survivors rather and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nCourage mountain many thanks to our correspondent in Jakarta encouragement sweny there with the latest on that crash of the line at line air airplane [noise]\nAnd just over a week America will go to the polls in a bitterly contested election that will decide who controls Congress political [noise] excuse me political campaigning just continued despite the shootings in Pittsburgh and the ... cents to many leading Democrats\nHowever the events of the past week have led many to cool for most civil tone to be introduced into political debates\nBecause we got correspondent Chris ... traveling across the U.S to have to use the voters today he's in ... in Wisconsin\nAnd\nPeople will be getting a little
