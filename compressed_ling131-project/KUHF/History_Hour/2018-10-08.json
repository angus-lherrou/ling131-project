argue both sides of the story um it is great that Netflix has is picking up and and now commissioning films that probably would not get made otherwise um his point though about algorithms is also a little bit scary\nTo people who are listening and he has that would bombed the rounds regulate what does he actually entailed so that means things\nLike when ah you go into Netflix and do you watch you you start watching a film and you turn it off after ten minutes on Netflix knows that the contract that when you watch it from all the way through maybe watch it again I Know that they know that you like that\nThat goes into an algorithm of what what keeps people watching they also used the little ratings when you give us some up or thumbs down or at a star rating or something that is something Netflix will take into account\nAnd sniff dumb no I've never waited in the Olympics I should I Do it that's one of the problems with these algorithm\nIs is that not everybody uses them so

send them all live well one\nOf the things about Netflix picking up a little films is that\nMost of these films if they had been released traditionally would play in a few cities for a few weeks for the most people would never see them on the big screen anyway so I I think that's a good thing it is it is opening up more and more interesting films to bigger audiences it's a little bit scary but I think more more outlets is only a good thing\n[noise]\nHave anything wait until ... when the ... hours making you take to social media do ... BBC up that way you're listening to the ... on the b._b._c. World Service let me turn to you now musician and\nMusic all it just goes up you on described as Iran's pop style in exile and we'll find out why in a moment you started to play various musical instruments from the age of five when you were growing up in Iran and even the music is frowned upon in many parts of the country and female thing as a almost on the hurdles\nYou know and the ... of traditional Iranian music\nThen let's talk to you being a member of a ROMs only go group all\nKate and eventually because of the Iranian regime strict rules on performing and singing you came to the u._k. in order to pursue your music career I think that was twenty eleven and use you know doesn't make any\nStrategies for amongst his degree in music psychology now you're about to release your latest English language single the line but let me off the festival why are you in exile\nGo law and one of the reasons that I left Iran as as much as I Love my friends and family was because I Want to think\nYou can sing in Iran but you can only think two female audience us and when you were part of the ... the old adage that ... you had to do the only could\nPerform in front of female audience on stage we couldn't move the only could play our instrument saying the audience she didn't move either and we have morality police and ... and so that if anyone who's a they had to act\n[noise] she couldn't even swayed to me you know what were you wearing then\nA very long pet and a very long track hit that we had our basically long sleeved shirt that date and the arms are covered but also the you know it's a sign at the time I I really enjoyed being in that band so ... why can't you go back to Iran and\nWhat happened ... as a female singer you cannot be public\nYou CDs or songs should not be out there and as soon as it happens than than you are in the risk of rest\nSo so your own music you created music vet and it was made public or is it that they use the music you've made since you came to the u._k. is gone public that\nThe music that came to the u._k. it went public and at that ... that made a huge difference in me not being able to go back to Iran has to be hawk biking for that was really heartbreaking but the stronger thing for me was that I was able now to sing\nTo talk about what I wanted to talk about and there was no one to tell me what to do what not to\nAnd the more important thing for me was that I wanted my story in my message to be headed for other people to know what the human goes through in Iran and I was hoping and I always hoped to be able to make a difference\nYou know to to be able to change something so that not older we mental teenagers go through the same thing that I went through so\nYour parents are worried I presume about you trying to have a music Korea what did they feel when you decided to come to the u._k.\nAt first they wanted me to become a doctor\nBecause they knew that essence female singer could not find a job in Iran if she's not arrests that she cannot find a job so have you been arrested for many times\n[laughter] oh I got accounts that he had many time for for many reasons not only music related but what else have you been doing\n[noise] ooh and bad job I'm\nOn a a badly placed or ...\nIf you're a scarf and not in the right place your hair is showing your neck his out if there if if it's windy and suddenly you're naked out if you're not lucky\nWhen you get arrested I'm ... I'm fascinated by this because it sounds like something Toby frightening to me I mean all you just arrested in given this falling all you put into jail all you intimidated how does it actually work\nOn the fact that you're being arrested is really scary they put you into prison it depends on how much they liked cue or how are you talk to them it's a very very very moody situation\nBut for for one occasion I remember that I I was in prison and I was pretty bored and scared at the same time 'cause I didn't know what's going to happen next so I was like okay I Need to make this people annoyed\nAnd the best thing I can do is to a sink loudly and shout and you know for an hour forty five minutes I was doing that than someone came in and she was like\nAll right stuff it and I you know continued so she was like give us a no bread would need to call you your family to come collect you\nSo you have no had more than two hundred million listens on social media to your tracks and blue say and ... no state you did a highly controversial collaboration with Israeli sing a Eden have\nTell us a little bit about that you know what I loved that collaboration between Iran and Israel there is zero political relationship so when they talk about is right you are scared because he feel like oh my God enemy you know\nBut when I came out of their own and I came across um eat don't means it one day\nAnd really really loved it I send you off at that sound\nSo is this the ... that you collaborated on yeah it's called ... got nose and he wrote it first and then kind of Portuguese he proved I heard the song and I decided to create my own version of it in which language posse right\nI Would really put my heart into it and I put it on YouTube\nHe came across the song and contacted me one day and set them you know I'm going going to work or do you want to join me to sing the song together\nSo we had we met in London\nThe same night we went on to state and the ah we performed a song and that was the best collaboration one of my best collaborations or I can say so far it opened up the fact that through music we can communicate to no matter where you calling from no matter what language you speak oh\nMm\n\nWas just lovely to have that language and some of the instrumentation on some of your tracks I'm not so busy being very important to you\nYes I'm In London and living in the you cannot I'm Still playing like dulcimer you know every night 'cause the sound of different instruments rink so much members to you that you know it's like a smell\nI'm\nCalling all heavy and that seemed June is known in the well David by people who love the BBC series jumped to ... it's a bit of ... thing isn't it I used to love the series is a child especially the dog likes to the student ... out\nMay lie about them [laughter] so do you live in a minute then\nBritish actress Jodie ... is the new time node controversial to many as they've never been a female dumped the new series is hitting screens now and the anticipation is how puzzles Jody pumped into the baby seat to speak to show him gave me and he immediately off to about the criticism by some funds\nThe doctor who should not be a woman but well should do up to ... [noise]\nIt's an alien to hop on ... and ... said that it's the female of it that makes me unqualified for and I think it's like it's a tiny percentage here I think I think most people have managed to get over it\nPretty quickly did you grow these on the look of the new jump to a ... well the important aspects to keep from the original doctors to develop into a new realm\nMikel shave yeah it was really collaborative for me and re home and the ... we had essentially a blind flip I came with about\nFifty million pages and references and he\nToo if I had like a tiny idea he was an elevator to an end and the drawings that he would come up with were amazing but for me the most important thing was they use of color was they use as different aspects of the blues to represent like this guy for the inside lining up here is like space and the outside is like\nIs de ... things like that I Lived referencing the the world's that you're coming from the costume but then it needed to be comfortable here because often it weighs heroic ... characters\nI just ain't that looks really fast [laughter] and it takes you about an hour to get us whereas my is really cool and fat and goofy for anyone\nBoyle go Chicago [laughter] it the movement I wanted to not feel like I was being wrong by the costume I Want to live the aspect\nIs that the that teach it makes it quite you'll but then the prices and the child is quite structured and so that that could be from a completely different time period\nI imagine it's a wonderful freedom in a way to ... employer don't too because this ... remote to ... ... people with ... ... to ... is part of the great thing about that you can put any which way you want\nYeah and I think being the first female and I will be the last ... liberating about that is I feel like there's less pressure like as if it forever to come into play it you are given free rein to take\nThe energy all kind of ... you know trip throughout the fifty five year here a that you own a ... I Am just have to basically lemme lines which is harder than it found that then be open to\nEvery new light all ... all character coming into it and so there's no constraint through tradition of how does someone behave in the scenario because the doctor can behave however that is wonderful and\nI'm quite happy ... try ... Berlin So I just it will all the things that are kind of mean between things usually on jobs I just saw while she'll buy in the area of things can see what [laughter] you know will know about to interview a\nFabulous Judy went to the new ... who Marianne as a film critic who will say love TV on do you are a ... from the reaction we goal when I started listening to that I'm a huge shock to her fan so how did you feel when you first heard about Judy which could cost is the time I was very\nExcited I Can't wait to see which is going to do she's an amazing actors to start with and the show could really use a bit of shaking up which is great um I don't understand the controversy at all I mean this is a story about aliens and your past and future and time travel and this was the thing that people think it's too unrealistic\nSo what is it because don't do you is both a huge brutish and international success ... which is about the show why is it says that I think it's it's\nJust like the purists flight a fantasy cute and stories can literally go anywhere you don't know what's going to happen you can be in the past and the future you have no idea what kind of bizarre creatures you're going to meet a literally anything can happen and often does and I think just the idea of that the tortoise as a metaphor like for your imagination getting the tortoise and just go anywhere think anything be free\nCola not only do I know that you love dumped who thought I also know that you are closer to the series that all of us in the ... tell us why\n[laughter] I ... as you said I Love doctor who series and I was in it actually I used to do voice over a couple of characters and therefore BBC pass\nAnd I know Iranians are big fan of doctor when they watch every episode series it somewhere can it be seen in Iran BBC Persia\nSatellite so you did the voice Eva translations you sort of dumped areas carrot to that's right so how do you feel about the dogs are being female she know what I'm so happy 'cause I always felt well why\nIs not the main character a female and as soon as I realize that the new doctor who was a woman\nI was like [noise] yes go for it and I was so happy ... potentially be falling for it\nIn ... um we will keep our fingers crossed\n[noise]\nHe always the b._b._c.
