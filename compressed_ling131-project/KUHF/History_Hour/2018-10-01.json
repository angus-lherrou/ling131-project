early nineties in New York City and so Lewis says just prepared some food he's in the kitchen Henry's in his little room which is right next to the kitchen and so I guess I'll just jump in\n... uh Lewis has just made a plate of spaghetti and then he says\nOh no there's a cockroach on my food I Bello D what should entering a cockroach on top of my spaghetti\nYou forgot the first rule of survival in this apartment said Henry without sympathy never leave food out you didn't teach me that rule I said you should have learned it before coming here don't enlisted in the military if you're not prepared to fight\nI threw the passed away and the cockroach since I'm unable to kill anything directly even cock roaches with which our apartment was infested though no one had ever been so brave estimate my food\nAfter dumping the pasta I boil some more water and started all over\nHenry From his coach told me to wash my dish an added that I should always washing my dishes before eating explained to me teaching me some survival rules after all that are cock roaches we're walking all over our plates while we slept leaving behind in invisible trail of germs\nSo we were to wash dishes before eating as well as after\nHe came into the kitchen and rent to play to demonstrate this special to step methods first hot water to get\nRid of the cockroach germ she said than cold to get rid of the lead from the hot otherwise you'd die New York has led into top water that you might not have learned in New Jersey\nAnd we looked at me intent need to make sure that I understood the lesson and then said ... for cockroach cold for less hot for cockroach cold for led by God it I said well don't catch on to quickly that's the problem with staff once they know what to do they leave\nIt was a backhanded compliment but it made me feel good you didn't want me to lead\nOh I'd love that thank you very much I Know that you have a boxing named the herring wanting to decrease you have actually boxed into battle yeah why did you do that\nI got into the ring because I had a romantic notion of fighting you know lifting up those ropes and getting in there it was almost like when I was a child I used to wrap towels around my neck and pretend to it was a Cape than I was a superhero\nShow boxing was a chance in real life to play hero to and then I got in the ring and I discovered\nOh we'll one it's terrible to be hit and I know you're I've learned a lot about brain injuries since they're not very good to be pounded in the head\nAnd then it was terrible to hit other people I I Would hit someone and I'd see their face grim is and I would say oh I'm Sorry and my trainer the course of don't apologize method that point of it or I should say I was called the herring wonder\nBecause at the time and I still do I ate a lot of herring and I followed it you know it's a it's a fish low on the food chain so doesn't have a lot of mercury has a lot of oils and it's good for the brain especially if you're getting hit so that blows out of the brain killed some brain cells\nBut the oils from the herring build them backups are just sort of maintain an equilibrium and Disney sting well yes that was my other thinking what a herring breath and rain\nTo further repel my opponent so I Would come into the ring with a jar of herring in my hand you know like a white with spinach and then my fans in the audience were waving silver herrings\nBut then you say this is another thing I could be a really good to have an ... or some way of like putting off your opponent you makes him very strange noise here still go back to your fourth grade school days late 'cause you wind up and a little town called ...
