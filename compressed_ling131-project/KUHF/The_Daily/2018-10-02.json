I'm having second thoughts\nI think your idea about a week delay to give the FBI time might actually be possible but I'm nervous she says\nAnd so what follows is absolutely a remarkable scene where suddenly this conversation between these two men becomes much larger senator ... goes out and get some of his Democratic colleagues come in and continue the conversation behind closed doors\nSenator Tom to list of North Carolina Senator John Cornyn of Texas to Republicans they also come in over the next forty five minutes or so you have virtually every member of the committee\nBack in this small cramped hallway behind the committee room and what's happening is Senator Flake is essentially standing\nPretty much silence according to the people who describe the scene\nAs he's surrounded on both sides by these two warring political\nFactions so the Republicans on the committee senator tell us instead of recording and are arguing strenuously you can't do this this would be terrible it's going to throw the judge's wife even more Chris Coons and the Democrats are trying to coax him along saying look you know this is what the Senate it's about it's about compromise it's about\nFinding a way forward without\nJamming something through for political purposes it got very heated as it was described to us and all of it with Senator Flake\nComing even more anxious was he going to reverse

media\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nMy share how does decide to move forward\nSo at one point he raises the concern of is this something that the FBI could even do is this something that would be valuable to the FBI do they have the resources do they have the wherewithal\nSo somebody suggests calling Christopher Wray the FBI Director they try that they can't find Christopher Wray they can't reach him\nAnd so the second choice is to call Rod Rosenstein how it comes down to you know a phone call with the very man who depressant might yet firing was actively considering firing\nThat the phone call that obviously needs to be done with some privacy so Chris Coons and Jeff Flake\nCrammed themselves into one of these old fashioned kind of oversized phone booth closed the door took out a cell phone and essentially put it on speaker and called Rosenstein we're told that Mr Rosenstein does reassure Senator Flake that the FBI can do an investigation though he does say\nThat given the scope of it relatively short amount of time less than a week but it's unlikely\nTo produce a lot more than senators already know but he says yes we can do that\nSo with this green light from Rosenstein what Senator Flake do Senator Flake there's one last thing before he comes back into the hearing room and that is that he takes his phone and he calls two of his Republican colleagues who are not\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary committee and that is Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska he called the two of them and basically said are you guys with me\nBoth assured send a flake that yes they would back him and that they would demand the same thing a one week delay and an FBI investigation armed with that Senator Flake went back into the committee room\nKnowing that the Senate Republicans and President Trump would have to relent because if they didn't they wouldn't have the votes ultimately to confirm judge Kavanaugh without the three Republicans [noise]\nAs a as a point of personal privilege I'm going to call on Senator Flake just fake uh normally we would start to vote right now but at some point of personal privilege Dr recall on certified\nIt's interesting it all happens very quickly and even for a veteran watchers of the legislative sausage making process it was it was quite messy\nUm I I've been speaking with a number of people on the other side we have conversations ongoing for a while a with regard to making sure that we do due diligence here senator\nFlake announced his decision and I think it would be a\nProper to delay the for a vote or for up to but not more than one week\nHe said that he had changed his mind and then now believed that he would be willing to vote for judge Kavanaugh's nomination to move forward from the committee to the full Senate but only with the assurance that this one week to lay would happen\nSo that's without agreements or I Will vote to it ... for a cargo overall just right just one second can can Diane ... a couple of\nThe Democrats including Senator Feinstein started to try to ask some questions to clarify exactly what that meant and what assurances they would have that it would happen\nWhen every voting on that say we are voting on a motion to report the nomination to the floor\nSenator Grassley quickly said recalls the role that photo in the motion\nOf person who calls the role started calling senators names they started saying yes you're\nOn the Republican side\nHigh as promised Senator Flake vote yes\nOn\nDemocrats weren't quite certain I think in some cases what was happening they all voted no and before you knew it\nOn the two are all were drawn\nSenator Grassley had gaveled down and said the ayes have it judge Kavanaugh's nomination has been kind of approved by the committee and
