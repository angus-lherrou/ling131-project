whole truth and nothing but ...\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment as I'm dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at the time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about red knot and what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us went to dance with her she hung out with us as a group\nShe's a dear friend that we really respect I'm really upset that this has been taken out of context\nA media circus that there's been generated by this thought and reported that referred to sex or did not\nThe people I was talking to who knew him at the time cried BS on this they said Brett Kavanaugh spoke about her disrespect lease so did his friends it was not at all if he's presenting it and that's just a lie in terms of the drinking\nA drink beer with friends\nJudge Kavanaugh presented himself as someone who liked beer\nI still like beer\nSometimes I have too many

reporting after last week\nSherry after this testimony that prompted so many people to come up and talk about Kevin those high school days\nAfter the hearing what was interesting was the gloves came off\nOne of his Yale classmates says the person he portrayed himself to be today does not match the person she knew at Yale room\nAnd when you suddenly saw up some of the people who had been reluctant to speak to me in the first place on national television\nI don't buy it I I um I didn't that's not Brad I knew as soon as I met him in college it's not the bread I sighed during four years at Yale\nTalking about Brett as a drink or who would get incoherent\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Wylie yeah he was a big party are often drank the excess and there had to be a number of night where he does not remember\nI had one of my sources say to me anyone who says that he wasn't rip roaring drunk isn't telling the truth\nAnd I would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said and I drank to access in high school I drank access in college I did some stupid things I'm Better now but I never sexually assaulted anybody back\nTo lie under oath to lie about that\nThan White House his trip to the ... you know and the highest position and the judiciary in our Lance and not the difference between truth and lies that that's just terrible it\nThey just kind of let loose in a whole new way and what was also interesting was that whole sense of loyalty to him and those who are still protecting him\nWhile also was eroded where this suddenly became a little bit of a come to Jesus moment where people realize they had to choose sides and if that meant losing friends\nIt was worth it the stakes were too high and they were going to come down on the side of truth and who were some of the people who came forward um most noteworthy was one of my classmates named Chad letting ten he was the class of eighty seven he was a basketball player a very big guy\nHe said he had a statement he was going to give it to me Monday today he ended up giving it to me last night and it was\nPretty powerful statement what does it say he talks about how he was formerly reluctant to speak but he didn't necessarily think Brett's alcohol use in college had relevance\nBut that now after hearing him on Fox and hearing him testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary committee he became quote deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by breath himself on his drinking at Yale and quote and how does he described\nThe drinking you saw he goes on to say that especially in their first two years of college when he often drank with Brett quote on many occasions I heard Brett slurring his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was here when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nOn one of the last occasions I purposely socialize with Brett I witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark not by diffusing the situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail\nSo he's actively refuting the characterization the judge Kavanaugh offered in the Fox interview and most importantly under oath before the central committee\nThat's right and even subsequently after putting this out yesterday Chad talk to me about how it was important to him that we portray that this was about truth it was not about college behavior and I think that is an important distinction that is what bothers people\nIs the degree to which Brett is not representing himself accurately not the behavior itself\nWell I think Robin makes a good point here which is that it's the idea of lying under oath that really disturbs people I think people could overlook excessive drinking maybe some craft comments I've talked to people who said you know I did worse than Brett did whatever it was\nBut the idea that he would be an truthful about this a sitting judge who's nominated for the Supreme Court that he would be dishonest and belligerent about these things on the stand in front of the nation in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\nReally oppose them ... that is the kind of thing where people say two things like it's the cover up not the crime\nWhen all this reporting started the question originally but we were all asking was do Brett Kavanaugh commit these alleged acts of sexual assault and now the question is in the process of defending himself against those charges\nThe cabinet knowingly mislead and use the public and also members of the United States Senate about what's seem in comparison to those original allegations like smaller matters\nI think that's absolutely right I think you've got what is a very grave and relevance to character and ability to serve on the Supreme Court accusations about an attempted sexual assault many years ago", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
