there were these pipe bombs being male might wake everybody in my business up a little bit\nYeah well you're not wrong first of all the central social issue really was and in my judgment is abortion\nMhm and the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the right to life movement United around the notion of amending the constitution to ban abortion over time\nPeople figured out a couple of things first of all that there was not going to be political support for amending the constitution and second of all of there was a political support for banning abortion but right to life much still was quite United around trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be a\nBill Clinton you know ran for office saying where abortion is safe abortion should be stable illegal and legal but rare and rare\nBook\nHe felt the need to use the word rare because he understood people were I easy about abortion even though they did not want to ban them so binding away to try to restrict some abortions without banning abortion across the board resulted in\nThe focus on late term abortions which most people oppose that most people thought by the way were illegal\nThe term partial birth abortion means the person performing the abortion partially bad generally delivers a living feeders before killing the fetus and completing the delivery\nNamed partial birth abortion did not exist until someone who wanted to ban and abortion procedure made up this erroneous and inflammatory term\nWhen it came to these particular late term abortions what seemed to me either very clever or definitely cynical depending on your point of view was that it supports Democrats to take the lead a position on abortion and its most extreme which then painted them into a corner\nYeah I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't accept the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back in the Nineteen eighties and the Reagan Democrats essentially were southerners that used to be Democrats\nAnd blue collar northerners mainly Catholics that used to be Democrats crossed over and they voted for Reagan well in both cases there were Democrats that were at odds with the liberal consensus on these social and cultural issues we've been talking about\nSo you take a democratic politician and you put them in a very difficult position if you force them to come front and center on some of those issues because it created a wedge between their liberal base if you want to use that term and the more traditional\nConservative cultural voters so to force Democrats to confront those issues you know was a winner for the Republicans no question about it\nYou know it's funny one of those early memories I have from back then was seen Patty Murray and very liberal Democrat from Washington state\nAnd and you know I'm sure you remember her as soon as it was during the year the women and I think she was just avatar progressive promise and suddenly the Senate was voting on the defense of Marriage Act\nAnd she like the majority of Democrats was voting to ban gay marriage and I remember coming off the floor being surrounded by a scrum of local reporters\nAnd she looked pretty miserable defending her position\nYeah the ... well the Democrats were definitely tortured over those issues and a lot of them change their position to conform with a more liberal cultural view and that accelerated the movement of cultural conservatives into the Republican Party there were no longer\nRonald Reagan Democrats or Bush Democrats [noise] they were Republicans\nSo how do you think the strategy has aged\nWell that's a good question I I think that yeah I I think that there are some issues where it's continued to work but I think that there are some problems that\nThe Republicans face long term\nBecause of the changes in the culture the most obvious I think and it's a place where I think Republicans are changing as on\nOn the L. D. V. T. Q. issues\nBut I think that those issues\nI don't know if I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would simply likes to say\nThey present a challenge to Republicans going forward even if in the short term\nThey are working it would seem to the benefit of President Trump and the Republican\nSo you were anticipating where my mind was moving wishes that certainly his latest two thousand for gay marriage seemed to be working and the Republicans favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more of them have hurricane marriage not\nAnd many older Republicans are keeping mom about this issue I keep thinking about how John Kades it during the debates [noise] you know gave this response when asked about gay marriage where he just basically said that his God told them to let everyone\nKnow I I think I think that the gay issue is a little different than some of the other cultural issues\nOne of the things that's happened is that everybody today knows gay people that was not always the case when there's people kept it hidden\nAnd an awful lot of the Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a theological issue or theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do think that they were on the wrong side of history\nYeah\nI mean on that one I Would say yes yes\nThen more broadly do you think that maybe other wedge issues are short sighted I mean 'cause that was one of them\nWell I don't I don't want to broaden by response on that you know I don't I don't want to say that's true of cultural conservatism generally\nI I I Would not extrapolate\n\n\n\n\nTheir daily it's supported by homemade visor matching homeowners with health improvement professionals full of variety of home projects from minor repairs to major models homeowners can read reviews of local pros added book appointments online it helmet visor dot com\nAnd by fracture creating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass a fracture is an image frame andme out all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more at ... dot com slash daily\n... public media this is my guest matters emergency management and all the\nMedia is really the backbone of our alerts and warnings when it comes to a coordinating with the media when we flew shot an emergency alert dose of Houston Public media the dentist forms the rest of the media to get those alerts out to people listening to the radio or watching\nTV [noise] she's in public media in one of our key partners in getting emergency messages out being able to work with Houston Public media and things like caffeine I'm really kind of help cement that partnership\nData caissons believe that we use to lead is on TV spectrum to block ...\nOkay can you tell me what's happened to you during Hurricane Harvey we were able to transmit video of real time water levels\nIn real time rain this way back to the office and the men you\nMake it all possible with your financial support\nThank you [noise]\nUm [noise]\n\nMy colleague opinion columnist Jennifer senior spoke with former Republican congressman Vin Weber\nI Am now thinking about the minister Haitians efforts to try and establish a legal definition of sex\nWhen that effectively calls into question if not obliterate entirely the category of transgender identity and you know when he did that I immediately did flashback on Nineteen Ninety four 'cause it's another wedge issue do you think it's politically screwed\n[noise] if it doesn't strike me immediately as being politically smart no and why do you say that because I think that it reinforces a stereotype that Republicans are discriminatory against large groups of people based on gender\nAnd the transgender issue is not the same thing as gay marriage but it's in the same world and I think that particularly young people\nAre developing an attitude that Republicans are any tower at a lot of things that they take for granted\nBut it's not just the sexual orientation issues immigration in my view as a cultural issue was very much the same thing young people have grown up with people from different cultures and nationalities and ethnic backgrounds around them and they just don't understand", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
