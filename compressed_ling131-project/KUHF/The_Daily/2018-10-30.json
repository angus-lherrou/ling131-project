institutes of health they're still spending a lot of money especially in the high risk high and search and say it's as high capital investment Hayes is however they've been under attack\nBut the real issue shouldn't just be the budget should be the ... the ability of these organizations to continue to really lead the way\nTo have a mission which aren't asked and the budget Appropriations Committee you know what is the economic value going to be\nBecause of how they thought about net present value in cost benefit and you know economic value as economists think of that in terms of jobs today and patents et cetera then there's no way we would have done them out on the moon mission that actually required a certain level of ambition of imagination of a willingness to dream\nSo any country that's interested in tackling areas around climate change or rethinking twenty first century healthcare systems\nTackling the aging demographic crisis these are all brought challenges which unless we really framed them as missions and then we're not going to be able to tackle any of these grand challenges that's what we should be learning instead of oh we need more venture capital\nSo you're making an argument that the U.S government um is not getting enough credit for its investment in the past through agencies like DARPA NASA and then in the farm area and so and\nYou also argue separately that they're not getting enough return on the investment which but that sounds you know believe all\nBut you also argue that the high return and relatively low tax environment for entrepreneurs and investors is not\nA big driver I'm and I want to know what the evidence is for that I mean I look at the U.S as you know one question you ask because we're Europe's Google's what happens differently in the states than in Europe to produce these companies like Google Facebook et cetera\nThere are certainly a lot of people in private equity in venture capital in the start of culture who say\nThat because of the capital gains tax environment because of the carried interest loophole um that that that helps create the very large incentive\nTo make these companies that turned out to be super rich and I'm not even saying these handful of companies that turned out to be super rich or necessarily so bad for society I think that's a a bigger discussion for another day\nBut I just want to know what's your evidence that that incentive is not really important and is perhaps a key factor in why this is happening in the U.S and not in Europe\nSo my answer is first of all what happened in the U.S is that there was a system of innovation which lacks in many European countries\nWhere you had patient finance but also active mission oriented agencies which really thought about big problems so going to the loan which required many different sectors to innovate including clothing not just aeronautics\nAnd the instruments including prizes and ... policy which allowed start ups to scale up\nRight start ups in and out themselves who cares [laughter] because you have a start up what's interesting is if you have a system an entrepreneurial ecosystem I don't believe in entrepreneurs I Believe in entrepreneurial ecosystems which actually allow start ups to scale up and\nSo you know interestingly Europe has learned a wrong lessons from Silicon Valley and it's just part of the because of how the u._s. talks the u._s. talks Jefferson but an ax Hamilton [laughter] um so you know Jefferson talked more about getting the state that it away and Hamilton before getting\nInto his dual with bar [laughter] who is buried by the way in the town I grew up in Princeton New Jersey was very much about an active industrial strategy\nSo Europe interestingly I think I've learned all the wrong lessons China on the other hand and this was really curious China has learned the right left China's actually doing for the green economy with the U.S government did for the IT revolution at the same time that Trump Donald Trump dismantling what I call the entrepreneurial state ...\nComing up next week on the economics radio will continue this conversation and talking about how you the taxpayer

act of domestic terrorism which was this male bombing bomb sent through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations like CNN and the suspect in that case this guy from Florida Caesar say Iraq\nHe also use social media to post sort of extreme and divisive content but he didn't at a different way he was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big mainstream platforms\nAnd he was using them to get into fights and attack people engage people who he disagreed with and that was sort of the appeal of that service to him was that everyone was there and you can find his enemies and communicate directly with them [noise]\nRobert Bowers seems to have flocked to gab for the opposite reason because that was where the people who agreed with him or and that was where he could find a community of people who shared his views who he could communicate openly with without sort of the watchful eye of the platform getting in the way\nKevin you and I have talked about the fact that social media sites like Facebook and Twitter need to be stronger about policing this sort of speech that we're talking about\nBut I Wonder if your concern that what we're seeing here with gab\nMight be a consequence of that any crackdown at all has pushed people with more extreme views on a smaller and less public and more fringe the social media sites where inevitably there's less oversight and also\nMore people who hold equally extreme or more extreme perspective and is that a problematic outcome well I think one\nThing that we do know for sure is that when people get kicked off of Twitter and Facebook and other large social media platforms they don't just stop posting they don't go away\nThey find some place else that will tolerate them more turn a blind eye\nAnd I think we have to get comfortable with the reality that one of the trade offs of having ... our biggest and most influential social platforms be healthier and less toxic is that a lot of the worst stuff is going to get pushed into the smaller\nMore private enclaves\nAnd there might not be any way to avoid that even if it shuts down even if something else takes its place\nKevin what have you been thinking as you've been reporting on all this over the weekend because it feels like for many months we've been talking about the divisions on social media\nMostly in terms of politics what they meant in twenty sixteen what they might mean for the midterms but it feels like the events of the past week has sort of exploded that idea that\nThe stakes are actually far higher\nWe're talking not about how this divisiveness might affect people's votes but about how it's getting into people's psyche is and is doing unbelievable we'll roll damage yeah I think for the last\nSeveral months I've been covering\nSocial media with a focus on what affect all of this behavior happening on social media would have\nOn one set of elections and when I'm realizing is that it's far far bigger than that because what we're really seeing is the kind of breakdown of the dividing line between online bad behavior and real world violence\nFor awhile lots of people thought that because\nThreats or abusive language were happening on the Internet and it was somehow less real name was less threatening to receive a death threats on Twitter than it would be to receive it over the phone or in person right and I think now we know\nThat that's just not true that often this stuff is one in the same that the threats\nAnd the conflict and the polarization that erupts on line and in the media\nCan bleed over into real world violence and are doing it pretty frequently and in ways that are horrifying\nThe consequences of all of this of this stirring up of anger and hatred and poll\nThere's a show and I think are going to be with us for a long time\n[noise]\n\n[noise] bearable terrible thing what's going on [noise] would have in our country frankly it all over the world [noise] and something has to

their own style and frankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences\nBut news around the president including vice president Mike Pence rejected any linkage between Trump's language and the ... of isolated extreme in\nBut I just don't think you can connect to the threats are acts of violence on and I don't think the American people connect to the
