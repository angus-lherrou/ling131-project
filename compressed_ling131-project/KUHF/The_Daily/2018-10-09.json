{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Okay you who do we play again tomorrow\nThey were playing the Houston Rockets late in the first quarter Ingram finally got his chance to play in the NBA [noise]\nYou know I\nThink before I got there is in the night before was when all the emotions were running wild and I'm not sure how to feel than you so excited yet nervous and all these other things but when it came time for the actual game in really turned into basketball very quickly for me and made things a whole lot easier how easy was it [noise]\nThink I'm scored Nineteen points that night including for three point shots it was one of the best debuts in leakers history as one of the most amazing debuts ever is thirty two year old rookie [noise]\nThe crowd began chanting MVP MVP [noise]\nSo [noise]\nUm we had no idea of the reach of this until my brother and my niece had called and told me they said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're blowing up Instagram you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\nSo I Know that your great three point shooter um historically great so but forgive me for saying this year's shot looks\nA little bit ugly with ya [laughter] um it's you know it's a little off balance and I know it works but I'm really curious to ask you I don't mean just to insult you it's an insult with a question do I get it I think that maybe\nIs part of what's kept teams are in the past ... from giving you a shot at the NBA and and I asked is thinking about um the story about Jeremy Lin knew so many teams overlooked and they later admitted\nThey overlooked him because he was an Asian guy and he didn't fit the template of what you know an NBA player was and I'm curious if whether you think that you're an traditional shot may have a hurt us in some way even if just like perception wise\nYou know what that means a good question I don't think so I Would say the gray hair probably has more to do with it but\nUh I had to guess maybe the the awkwardness of the shot or not not so much the awkwardness of it but the release point of it because it's a bit lower than most guys\nI'm already not the tallest guy so maybe there is worry about well hey this shot is going to get blocked that are leading the guys are too athletic for him to get that off so maybe that was a maybe that was a thought to be honest with\nYou All right so here's the big question um what's your future\nYeah so right now I'm uh my age in is in talks with a you know different teams were trying to get into a training camp right now that's the goal and you know hopefully there'll be some new soon to be but ah no word yet\nSo what happens if you know you don't get in a training camp you don't get to play for an NBA team what do you do this coming season\nYou will um it could definitely be the G leader um you know ... and it it could be another season of it I mean the job for me is simple you know just stay ready but the goal is and we will be continue into play that that much I can tell you\nIt's interesting you know as a sports fan I've been you know my whole life seen people ... trying to squeeze meaning out of sports beyond the game itself and a lot of times it feels kind of force but it strikes me that your story was really different what is it a lesson that we maybe should take from your story\nWhat I Would like for people to get out of it the most is that it it it wasn't just that you know I stuck with it all the way through and was happy about it all the time I've definitely had doubts ahead\nYou know disbelieve had discouragement you know you don't get to something or any dream or anything we're having um just you know Scott Free but I think that part about it is is the real is part\n\nJoined me in wishing on

never asked questions he doesn't give us in the press the satisfaction of getting that public sense of him and there's a sense in which he's saying I'll do the job\nBut I'm not playing well\nSo you said that the Supreme Court's power rests on perception what's the difference between justice cabinet or Justice Thomas carrying some kind of partisan animosity with them versus a perception that say\nIt's one thing for it to be true and it's another thing for people to think to be true right or the public pays very little attention to the Supreme Court and when it occasionally wakes up and typically during confirmation hearings and here's wait a second this is not only about law there's a political element to it\nThe Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop when the court issues a big decision like the twenty twelve decision upholding Obamacare\nEven people who were prove to the decision but thought the court was being political and how it affected the Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop so to the extent the court is viewed as political even if it really is even if people who follow it closely no it to be that perception is very harmful to the court\nBut what are the risks of a court that doesn't have the credibility I mean what are some of the practical ways in which a court that somehow doesn't seem as legitimate loses its place in our system\nOr the risk is simple the risk is they will order someone to do something perhaps President Trump perhaps someone else and that person will say why should I\nAnd that's happened on occasion in the nation's history
