and their back story how much has this governor's race been shaped by the question of voting rights and voting procedures\nIt was in the background for the entirety of the governor's race but it's really come to the forefront in the last couple of weeks\nAfter an AP report that fifty three thousand Georgians particularly African Americans were placed on the ending voter list\nHas really

fifty three thousand Georgia and do we know who those fifty three thousand Georgians are\nWe know that Seventy percent of them are black wow and that speaks to what the voting rights activists call this intentional racial voter suppression Stacey Abrams has said we're\nDeeply worried that fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\nThat this was a racially motivated he\nKnew from experience that this law has a disproportionate effect on certain community\nPolitically motivated attempt for the secretary of state to

is all just the controversy that was ginned up by Democrats and there's no real truth to it he has also said\nOil I mean she won't feel eagles to vote in Georgia I mean this is a shocking development in the campaign while she was campaigning\nFat Stacey Abrams is trying to get non citizens to vote\nI think hardworking Georgian should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like my

a little differently aid will not worthy of documenting documenting the blue\nWave quote is comprised of the undocumented and the document that Brian Kemp is to use that literally saying that she wants undocumented non citizens to go to the polls she denies that\nI'd never once argued for anyone who was not legally allowed to look at the state of Georgia should be allowed to vote when I said that day is that this is a state that should be looking out for everyone in our state she was meaning this is who are fighting for\n[noise] I've\nSeen them sleeping going back and forth so I just decided to go to Georgia and talk to voters and see how this was playing out on the ground and what did you find in talking to the voters were on this kind of suspension list of down here [laughter]\n[noise] I went door to door with a group of women who were volunteering six days a week to try to get voters information about\nThe election and we were out in that county which is one of the most diverse counties in Georgia and a key spot that Democrats would need to come out and turnout for Stacey Abrams too when [noise]\nI mean check your voter registration finally sat\nThere was one man I met who taught\nMe there [noise]\nThat that his daughter had just called him with the news about fifty thousand people on the painting lens and they both rechecked their voter registration but when you check that she was all good too yeah OK gray and found out that they were okay but it was really indicative of the type of panic that's going around especially among black voter\nHi Tom I have to settle for your time\nI met another woman who when we wave to her house she said\nMy husband [laughter] going on in one of the ones who get whatever\nI was registered by re check than my registration was fine but after the students we checked or my husband\nIf he was not register register them from going to see what's on law and\nShe doesn't know whether it was a change of address or
