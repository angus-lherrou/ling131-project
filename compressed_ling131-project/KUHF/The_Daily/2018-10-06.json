approval is expected later on Saturday and Mr Trump has tweeted just thanks for the Senate backing his Nick Bryant\nThis has been a milestone moment in American history one that does fit of Donald Trump against the me too movement one of the conservative America against liberal America what was the question itself in vain not just who to believe\nWhose side you want and this is such a major victory for the White House it instantly gives Donald Trump I like to see within two years of entering the White House has managed to get to right wing justice is on the Supreme Court and they should be the for decades to come\nLong after Donald Trump\nHas left office it's being reported in Hong Kong that the Chinese head of Interpol is taken away for questioning on his arrival in his homeland

video footage released like court order show he was walking away from police when the officer shot him sixteen times even after he collapsed and late motionless on the street\nAnd what about the Democrats how are they spin that FDR report\nBe held I can tell you I'm very differently\nThat the message was designed to get to choose for\nThe Democrats are saying this is an incomplete investigation that it was never intended to find the truth\nThere only ten people recession [noise]\nDuring that people out there that day that question sat\nThere were many more witnesses out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nMany fears\nThis was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts those fears have been realized so\nDemocrats are saying you know no wonder there was no corroborating evidence the FBI didn't look\nFor it to the Democrats aren't really disputing that this report doesn't offer any new information they're not saying that this report corroborate those allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh\nIf I was like what they're saying is that because this report was always so limited in its scope because of the small number of people who were interviewed and the large number of people who were never interviewed\nThat it can't possibly prove anything for anyone that this report was kind of a waste of time\nWell right and not only that I Can't possibly prove anything for anyone but that it was never intended to prove anything for anyone\nCandidly what we review today in a very limited time if it looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps why the White House I don't know\nFeinstein when as far as to say that the White House seemed to be blocking what the FBI could do\nAnd ensure that Ninety percent of his emails and memos were available\nThe Senate or the public in the hearings\nAnd as I talked to these senators today the Democrats I was struck by how many of them were

thank you [noise]\nSo both sides are spinning as they're talking to you inside the Capitol but isn't that exactly what we always expected because of the very nature of this FDR report as Grassley and even Kavanaugh himself said during the confirmation hearings\nThe FBI doesn't reach conclusions it doesn't tell you whether somebody is guilty or not guilty so that means that senators reading this report have to draw their own conclusions and those conclusions will inevitably be political\nWell that's right but don't forget Michael there's still a handful of undecided senators who are looking at these interview reports to help make their decision about whether to vote yeah your name on judge Kavanaugh and those senators\nWill be the deciding factor in whether or not he gets a seat on the Supreme Court\nSo what about those senators who are on the fence what did they say when they see the FBI report\nOK so first let's talk about who they are ... there are three Republicans Senator Jeff flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and there are two Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nBoth in a very tough reelection races now senator\nHi Kim announced today that she is going to vote no on judge Kavanaugh\nI Will be voting no one judge Kavanaugh\nShe said that Christine Blasey Ford testimony really echoed with her she found it very compelling and they wait on her\nYou know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you enjoyed yourself\nAnd that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge cabinet\nAlso she said that she had questions about his truthfulness ... at the hearings and so she's going to be a no we still haven't heard from mansion and we haven't heard from Murkowski\nAnd we heard a little bit from lake and\nCollins or do they say well Blake when he wasn't ducking reporters said one short sentence there is no cooperation that was it and Collins came out of the Republican briefing and said\nIt seems to be a very thorough investigation I'm going to go back in and read these documents later and that's all I have to say\nAnd what do you make those brief comments from these swing senators\nWell in one sense we could construe them as comments of support right they didn't say anything negative but they were both very careful\nAbout what they said so I think it's fair to say they signal their satisfaction with the investigation but they didn't necessarily say anything about how they would vote I think we still don't know how they're going to vote\nI Wonder to the degree that these undecided Republican senators may have always wanted to vote for Kavanaugh I Wonder if this report is designed to make it easier for them to do this I mean\nDefinitely easier than it would have been a week ago when Kavanaugh gave that very combative testimony Dr Fauci Ford gave her very emotional account of alleged assault and they were locked in this he said she said and maybe that that was the point of having this report on it the first place to make it easier\nFor these undecided Republicans to do what they were always going to do\nNo I think that's right I think in a way that was kind of the brilliance of what Jeff Flake did Republicans were mad when he asked for the FBI to investigate they felt he was just delaying something they want to push this nomination through\nBut in the end by asking for this investigation lake may have just been given coffers to himself and to Rick how skin Collins to vote yes if they end up doing that\n\nCheryl this entire investigation begins with an earthquake and senator Coons asking for it because they believed that this incredibly polarized and confirmation process had started to erode confidence in the Senate but also in the entire Supreme Court confirmation process\nAnd they believed that investigation was the only way to begin to repair all that and to restore confidence in the Senate and in the Supreme Court confirmation process I Wonder if you think the report ends up achieving any of", "show_name": "The Daily",
