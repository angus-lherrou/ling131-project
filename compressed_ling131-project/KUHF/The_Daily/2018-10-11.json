situation because of a stranger that was walking past and I started screaming for help but feel that to this day I kinda I'm Still impacted by it because\nWhen people even go in there and I'm Still like\nI don't want you to get them very uncomfortable and you just\nYou chose to tell your parents and people around you about it and and\nI took my mother as soon as I got home 'cause after this didn't I kinda like ran home today I guess there was a trend unless I usually don't run\nBut there was a journalist and I was running and I sit and they got home my mom started like why are you home silly and I'm like this is what happened to me she said you shouldn't have been out too late and after that I kind of just stop talking about it\n\nSo I Want to shift focus your to\nPre sensitive question especially given what we just heard\nOne of the conversation surrounding these accusations against Brett\nKavanaugh is that this was high school so how much weight should if Cary given that context and I'm curious what you think as high schoolers\nShould what you do now should what anyone in high school does now follow you around for the rest of your life\nYeah yeah because I feel like like obviously I was like a rite of passage\nWhen you've got to make mistakes and learn your way through it but there are certain things that it's just\nLike like saying\nHateful things to certain minority groups and things like sexual misconduct\nThat kinda stuff\nFollows the victim forever if it follows the victims for every well then you've got to do with it too that it's your fault you know what I mean\nWhen you're sixteen Seventeen a senior in high school you have a moral compass that will tell you what is right and what's wrong so\nIf you're already in the state of ... where you know what's right and what's wrong I mean you are consciously making a decision to do something wrong or you are cautiously making a decision to something which is the same thing going to be doing the rest of your life\nMhm I Wonder what you think the message was when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed many of you have talked about the experiences they happen to you or to people you know\nWe're assault and given the fact that he was accused of that and he was put on to the nation's highest court what's the message to you\nFor all we know it could have never happened but the fact just so the fact that he was accused shows that anybody can get away with anything as long as they have enough power\nAll five of that like people that um that are watching him might think oh if he got away with that I tend to because if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring me to like a trial like I'm I'm going to be good because look who is now our Supreme Court justice he got away with it so why not me to anybody else\nIt's kind of just feels like a bagel out really care about your situation type of thing from like the higher up than the government and stuff it felt like\nWe don't care if you like it or not you have to take it and like it feels like they don't care about our opinion or safety is the fact that we're even ... even though we make up like a big\nPercentage of
