thinking as when you do\nThat's right I mean but I think that belief is driven by a couple of factors one factor is just this this cultural phenomenon ... we've had this route culture of robots

were trying to find out what's special about us maybe it's not that we have a soul and other animals die\nWell maybe it's that we're intelligent maybe we have minded is somehow different an order of magnitude different from the minds of other creatures or or of objects its intelligence that sets us apart and makes a special and we're conscious\nSo does this tendency we have to set these two things together like well you know we're intelligent and we're conscious so intelligence and consciousness should go together\nBut actually that really doesn't have to be the case you certainly don't have to be very intelligent in order to experience pain and suffering and so we can imagine that that plenty of\nOther animals that may not school very highly on our very human centric measure of intelligence that nonetheless have they been conscious experiences\nSo to me these things why against the idea that that ... headed on another ... trajectory towards being conscious but yet it's

nomination\nSure so ... did not say what she was going to do on a vote for weeks and weeks after he was nominated even after the allegations\nIn North Dakota democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp is still undecided on Kavanaugh machines quickly losing support of women and now she's running twelve points behind her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer and if I Can't votes against Kavanaugh twice as many say they would be less likely to vote for her\nShe was not until about forty eight hours before the first spoke last week [noise]\nWe're following breaking is North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp has just told a local TV station that she will know I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nBut she said that she would oppose so Scott\nHi everyone wanted you to hear directly for me about why I'm voting against confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nMy understanding is that what finally spurred her opposition at least that's how she tells\nIn addition to the concerns about his past conduct last Thursday's hearing call into question for me to judge Kavanaugh's current temperament\nHis honesty and his impartiality these are critical trades of any nominee to serve on highest court in our country and\nShe was very disturbed by judge Kavanaugh's conduct that the here and in particular that exchange that Kavanaugh had with similar culprits are from Minnesota\nWhere the judge kind of snap back at some of the flow which are saying heavy whacked out hiking bothered by that she didn't like that conduct she's a former state attorney generals so she sort of has spent some time in a courtroom and shot I think in our mind that was not the kind of temperament and she wanted to see on the high court Dr\nFord um gave a heartfelt credible and persuasive testimony it took a great deal of courage and also came at great personal cost her her\nPolitically there was obviously pressure on her ... or cap on and I think it would have been more daring to as opposed to before the allegations Olympic once the allegations

there's no question that she trailing an uncle\nSo let's talk about what you've been seeing on the ground there in North Dakota yeah in a couple of days since senator high camp made this decision take us through your trip there\nSo I got the Bismarck on friday and the state capital of the middle of North Dakota and then Saturday\nI wanted to breakfast places in Bismarck and talked to voters the first one was kind of a traditional diner or you know a lot of folks they're having their scrambled eggs and more conservative place obviously there was a lot of support there for capital you talked to one fellow there who is very fond of hiking but there's no fan of Kramer all\nAnd he said he thought that Kramer would always all or hiking them bought politically he thought that she had basically see our fate\nBy opposing capital our place I went to was more of a kind of a lot ... place and I talked to one table for women\nGenerally democratic and Republican\nBrio before we're probably Kramer voters and one was a high camp or any kind of built for it to be a challenge to keep busy but he's one of the voters also know Kevin Cramer said that she was talking about that but that was hiking female against capital that was going to prompt her to make a grudging vote for Kramer\nA reason is because of abortion rights because this person strong Catholic anti abortion and just could not stomach the fact that her senator opposed the confirmation of this judge at the same time enough to lady at the table there was a high can vote around like a Democrat said that she would've been upset of Hi Kim hadn't have opposed\nDid not react the way I Would have\nBeen\nIn so that's the kind of challenge that she was asked you know in some ways are kind of the ... if you do damned if he does\nWhen it comes to voters in North Dakota Jonathan what do you think that this ultimately will come down to\nThis is the challenge high can pass politics has got more polarized as we all do but it's also got nationalized and local issues and regional questions are increasingly less relevant index federal races like Senate races to more straightforward question are you on a red team or the blue team\nAnd there's no question that it is a conservative state naturally her biggest challenge is to put it in any Republicans to vote for her at a Democrat used to be a lot easier it harder now\nSo in other words try as a candidate might to keep things specific and local they may have no choice but to pick one of these national teams\nOf course you've got to pick one side of the other end you know in the past\nDemocrats more conservative parts of the country in the public and the more liberal parts of the country for those lie to rely on a competency to rely on the politics of personality you have to have a wedding charming persona that could really help\nThose things matter less now because politics is too much more nationalized and whether it's Republican\nYou know in a liberal state or a Democrat and a conservative state it's not as easy to sort of create your own brand and oh boy\nThe perceptions and assumptions about National Guard\nSo who's Kevin ... it's almost like the candidates are having to choose not just am I a Democrat or Republican but am I with Dr Ford or am I with judge Kavanaugh\nYes there is no question about that that forward on Capitol have become stand in for the red to blue and if you support for that you're you know your team blue if used for cap now you're on the red and again that is the last sort of issue that high can't wanted to
