John McMahon has has this report\nAnd we will take back this review and we will make America great again [noise]\n\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message [noise]\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were called on it by reporters always said\nYou were seeing things that aren't there\nThat's right and remember the plausible deniability always came from the palace men that is a bunker Trump\nYou think the president does not like isn't as prejudiced against you think about the president the United states you bet and you know ... and ... you know what they thought the Kaylee\nThey say what wait a minute Donald Trump has a Jewish daughter Ivanka he has a son in law who was an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren and a Jewish ... how do we understand what you're describing is kind of unmistakable appeals to anti Semitism and an ad like this being president in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters he and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included racist that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to accused him of racism or anti Semitism but I Will say that when confronted with the darker side of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely about an electoral calculation by the president by those around him\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste or lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of awakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it often felt a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that change\n[noise]\nWas ... it was a white nationalist rallies that seemed like it was about race but suddenly you had all these young white man [noise] marching in unison and chanting\nFront [noise]\nNews will not replace [noise] and I remember being truly confused by that chance like why are white nationalist talking about Jews it did not make a whole lot\nIt made a lot of them [noise] why because there is kind of him the on an evil in the old right in this new breed of\nNeo Nazis and in the pantheon\nThe watch word is white genocide that they believe that the white race is being supplanted replaced watered down and they also believe\nThat the white race is superior to Latinos to blacks to anyone who is not white right and remembered Jews in their mind or not white\nBut they look around them and they say well wait a minute if we're the superior race how could it be that these brown skinned black skinned people are succeeding in white genocide are replacing us\nAnd that's where they look for the puppet master and they find the Jews\nThe Jews in the ... right world are the ones who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orcas raiders of white genocide are Jews\nThat's why Jews will not replace us\n[noise] so what's the connection why are Jews now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians max\nIns et cetera\nWell you know one of the central tenets of Judaism is\nRemembered this stranger for you or a stranger in the land of Egypt is actually part of the religion to welcome strangers to welcome immigrants are welcome refugees and actually American Jews really created the concept of repairing the world to food alone\nAnd this kind of welcoming response to the stranger extended the Nineteen fifties to African Americans who were then\nStoring the civil rights movement [noise]\n\nI Love the rabbi the Jewish community and I know they're not regime\nThat most important thing in my life\nThat the bigotry\nI Know the most urgent problem\nAdjunct\nDisgraceful\nShame for the most tragic problem\nIn the civil rights movement was a seminal moment for Jewish and black alliances\n\nAnd yeah and that has tremendous resonance to Jews and to el fighters in the civil rights and it also has tremendous residence for the alt right who always the Jews somewhere\nIn the background orchestrating their demise\nWhat's kind of complicated about this discussion is that I was so prepared to have you told me that all these troops you heard about were sexually falls but what's really tricky about this conversation and hard to grapple with is that Jews in America\nHave dumb things by welcoming outsiders that they're being accused\nOf doing by these white nationalist in ways that completely define all of a simple heat but what white nationalist believe is that these things were describing are being done not out of altruism\nNot out of a kind of scared of generosity but to undermine white people they see it as something being taken away rather than something being given\nExactly it all fits into the alt right world of white genocide\n\nWe'll be right

everything you're saying it would stand to reason that anti Semitism would flare up when ever nationalism is on the rise in the U.S\nOr internationally that same thing it is my view and this is a controversial view that when borders are blurred when distinctions actually are diminished\nJews tend to flourish but when the drawbridge is raise when borders are more clearly defined when people are defining sharply what it means to be an American or a Frenchman or Britain\nThose are bad times for Jews because as nationalism rises and as these ethnic and national distinctions are sharp and the Jews tend to be left out of that definition they tend to be isolated and eventually they tend to be persecuted", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "31"}
