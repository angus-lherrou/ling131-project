talking about the idea and and what exactly is this idea of carbon pricing short so they decided you wish to gradually emerging them either wasn't something that just live the life of what it off\nHis idea his sort of breakthrough idea was how\nCan we apply economics to the environmental damage that we know is caused by carbon dioxide and so we'll start has created this economic model that looked at the science of climate change and how much damage is caused by heat trapping and mission and how\nYou can extract from that the amount of damage caused by a single ton of carbon\nI think from your sister's anything I Hope it points out the importance of pricing\nOne kind of carbon causes fifty dollars have damage to tons of carbon cause a hundred dollars advantage and that damage is\nWant to fight and things like rising sea levels that weighed say damage your home and you know raise your insurance costs and lower your property values All right well that costs has been inflicted by a certain amount of carbon dioxide it's it's a complicated model he called it the social cost apartments\nPricing carbon putting a price is ending the season for us to put their covered up and then there's the ... you need to take\nThat with the true breakthrough once he came up with the social cost of carbon then you can apply that to policy you can take that over to the realm of governments dealing with carbon pollution and you can in a perfect world use it as a tax\nSo if if we go back to the basic idea of carbon price which is you want to raise the prices are going to just public so consumers but most of them and produces find less carbon intensive was producing them\nAnd what the scientists you wrote this new report and what economists who have been studying this issue for years have said it this is pretty much the most powerful and effective way to stop greenhouse gas emissions if polluters have to pay the same amount that they are damaging the environment to pollute\nYou were going to create all kinds of market signals\nConsumes consume less carbon intensive electricity but also produces coal to natural gas and natural gas to say when so it's it's this is an obvious substitution effects\nElectric utilities are going to say wow wind and solar are suddenly looking a lot cheaper\nSo if she which does all kinds of energy [noise]\nWould know that this money and say when it was rather than transfer over what does that that's where the futures\nAnd that it's it's not because it's associated with corporations because it's a story for British and if it sees these prices impresses programming direction it will know where to go to the vegetables\nAnd so you know in a theoretical way\nEconomists have looked at this and they said this is the way to send them market signal and you know if we see this implemented around the world that is how you turn around the entire global economy and it was that idea that north house why in\nThe Nobel for and that the scientists who wrote this new climate report elevated and said look this is that this is the solution this is what we've got to do\nSo basically his plan is to create a market incentive to solve climate change exactly\nSticker price on it and then the market does the rest\nWill have you with a new global program\nYeah but normally it's pretty clear in order for this or he's\nThe only way to global program just a corporate shill nations all the other ... fifty us states\nMost countries have to do this and to be clear there's new federal carbon tax right now and you\nKnow there's no federal carbon tax there's no federal crime and prayed some states have experimented with different forums that upcoming pricing most notably California\nAnd has never been deployed at a national level anywhere in the world yeah\nI think people may not be aware though how much has been embraced abroad\nWhat I find to be really interesting and an ironic about the idea of carbon price thing is that it's considered sort of politically toxic in the United states and yet it's being implemented all around the world\nIs widely used in Europe\nAustralia put in place a carbon pricing system\nModel for them is one of the Columbia\nCanada is moving forward to a national carbon price my next year\nYou know being graduated in ...\nSo most of the world's major economies are at least starting to implement some form of crime and pricing or implemented regionally with a plan to to do it at the national or federal level at the United states is absolutely the LA\nWeekly keeps us from
