{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "Yeah yeah exactly let's just say something about book publishing which is that book publishing is an incredibly or comical industry that they're you know four or five big companies that dominate book publishing and\nThey're often times jerks and so it's hard to have a whole lot of sympathy for the book publishers\nBut suddenly you have these five big companies that were up against one big company which was Amazon\nAnd Amazon basically controlled their access\nTo the marketplace and Amazon was renegotiating their e book contract with the publishers one by one\nTrying to strong arm them with their market power into pricing their books lower and lower and so to me it was grotesque and ominous that Amazon was just able to use its market power to try to dictate\nTo the publishers and this incredibly aggressive sort of way\nSo where where do you draw the line between winning we're competing and being\nEvil right persuade me that it's not just the case of big companies being really good at what they do and winning and you kind of having sympathies with the people who are not winning\nSo my book in some ways is a Valentine to competition that I I Believe that uh marketplaces most healthy when you have a number of market player so I might not love book publishing it might be too concentrated in some ways for my taste but at least they're five companies competing against one another\nFor the marketplace and so if I don't like the way that one company is treating me I can always go to another company or if I don't like the goods at one company is selling I can go to another company\nAnd the problem with Amazon and the problem with Google and to an extent with Facebook is that they become the only market player and so the choice that we have is consumers is limited and competition\nIs limited so my book is a ... my argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... any of our lives [noise]\nAs it happens this expansion has just released into Franklin for his own life we spoke to him last year just before his book was being published and there'd been a plot\nTwist

digital age it's run by the political scientist Anne Marie slaughter who's a former top official in the Obama State Department yeah one of the cool\nThings at New America does is that they give money to journalists who are writing book projects so uh you know I didn't get a lot of money from them but I got a small some and they were especially generous to me because I just been fired from a job at the at the New Republic\nAnd the partial funding for his book about the dominance of firms like Google suddenly became relevant because\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a ... for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nAnd it actually doesn't feel good because you America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow them when they've been so nice to me but\nThis does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired his name is Barry Lynn and he ran something called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly and a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nOr used to having affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of America and that is Barry Lynn now directs the open markets Institute\nSo the name of his project has not been taken away but his affiliation with the New America foundation has for\nWorking out of a we were on the uh fourteen hundred block and G street and Washington\n[noise] coming up next week on freakonomics radio the story is not as nice as the headlines
