of this article is being published as a political fight continues up to Capitol really over this question of whether or not he should be confirmed as the Supreme Court justice and in fact there's been another article which has been published this evening by the Washington Post and it's from some of Brett Kavanaugh's former drinking buddies\nThey say that they drink with him a ... um they say

downplayed is drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and and I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the Senate committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I don't think he should be on the court because regardless of whether I think he committed sexual
