most exposed where you're most\nVulnerable you have to maintain almost complete silence because aside from the sound of the wind maybe some dogs barking there is no sound\nLike so for Seventy two hours straight it's like basically like I'm being in church because\nAny sound could like compromise you and potentially get every body that you love killed\nAt the moment that story takes place how long had you been in country or how many of these have you been\nSo this was probably the seventh or eighth mission that I'd been on the mission started out typically it felt completely the same as any other mission\nSo it's probably like a around midnight or one or one or two o'clock in the morning\nWe approached the building and before I even got in like a chance to drop my rock\nLike my best friend comes up to me and uh he just looks really shaken up\n[noise]\nAnd he's like dude there's something wrong here there's just something bizarre so some media we're walking in this place is the first thing that I noticed was this Sam [noise]\n\nDissonance annoying it sounded almost like a like a broken radio in down in the fall [noise]\nJust [noise] completely [noise] a tone on I'm entirely\nDisquieting on hold some say almost sounded like a congregation of whispers [noise]\n\nLike thousands of voices trying to communicate something but in a completely nonsensical way and that really won the the point where I felt like something was really different this time [noise]\nI decided that you know it's going to look around some of the upper floors so as I was walking around like that the second story I came into this one room that it was completely stripped bare simple cement\nFor I don't know what ... to some too but I turned to face the interior room [noise] and\nJust saw that the wall was pockmarked with bullet home which were around so I was standing there looking at these pockmarked wrong it just seemed like something wasn't right that these they weren't typical and I'm In\nMy squad leader and showed me this like pencil trick you can insert like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall it'll tell you like the direction that the fire it come from\nThis being the second story I put the pimps or into the wall and it's a parallel to the ground just sticking in like it meant that those\nShots had been fired straight across\nSoon as I step that pencil and everything fell into place\nThis had to have been killed room but they had to lined people up in here and just\nExecuted them and I just felt a little keys in my stomach [noise] standing in a kill house [noise]\n\nInstantly just felt like the walls just collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get them out of the room [noise]\nIt seemed like there was a maligned presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get somebody killed and it was totally inexplicable you have to imagine that all of\nThis is under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just just before\n[noise]\nJust this ever present oral presidents\nJust feeling that you were feeling well we're all the I really didn't know what that like the ball and it's like anxiety and here\nThere's like a there's an under current of tension\nIt wasn't like a we all huddled together in a circle enter trading this back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened\nNobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness I think that if one person were to stand up and be like goes kinda scary we would have written them apart [noise]\nSo we're left with all of this downtime and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting\nIt's like hey there's a storage unit down first floor and that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto because it it gives you a chance I guess like um to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that you're not scared\nAs soon as that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah yeah man all on\nRoute to these people that have no business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there\nIt was just like a a gated off a unit on the first floor and I walked over there really him basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space\nAnd there's just a very simple symmetrical wrought iron gate on front\n[laughter]\nThose wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the bottom and just lived a quarter inch and then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't\nBe allowed at all we left the gate like prop all the way up and [noise]\nSo I think about half a dozen of us go into this a\nStorage unit of turn the tables chairs closing decoration silverware all kinds of things\nIt smells like dust old\nAnd it's pitch black and the only light\nIn the storage area is coming from or a little a little red tack like [noise]\nIt's already like three layers of spooky like we couldn't even\nUse our knowledge and the space are night vision goggles because it's so dark there's so\nLittle ambient light and not really for looting anyways because uh you know you really want to yeah needed there's there's an art to this deplorable practice\n[noise] the only sound as like a flight wrestling [noise] I pick my way probably two thirds of the way back into the storage units and um I find is cardboard box\nWith a couple of cheap little paintings and one of just a like a pass or landscape the creek in it was like oh these are going to look I'm basing in my room [noise]\n\nThen I turned after finding them immediately I turned to my left to show off my bounty\nWas just met with pitch darkness just trying just blackness [noise]\nThere was no one else [noise] and I was completely\nOn my own [noise] and I didn't feel like I tunneled out on these paintings I mean this wasn't like the release it wasn't like I was you know just drinking in starry night with my eyes I was just like ... these are nice painting hey check out the oh I'm Alone [noise] makes no\nSense is that how six guys were able\nTo creep out of room you can step on the floor because of all of this furniture all the crap and mediate only [noise]\nI feel like a lead and white in my stomach [noise]\nI just steal my nerves [noise] put my paintings took them under my arm and started trying to quietly\nMove towards that gate [noise] I'm\nClimbing over this stuff meticulously but the entire time I just want to run [noise] by the time I got to the front gate I it really work myself into a fraud I was really terrified I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could [noise]\nAnd I get up there to the gate gate is slow [noise]\nIt was like well what do you mean it's an ... he's like there are many people died in that building so it's an clean and no one goes there [noise]\nAnd [noise] when he said that [noise]\nYou really are brought home to me what had happened\n[noise]\nAnd it's such a thing to admit it's like such such a bad thing but I picked up the painting\nAnd that was like hey get do you guys know where to go and he went ... I Want to you know what I found cagey and it was like here man I Know this is really special to you\nI'd really like for you to have this and if I gave it away\nPart of new pardon you feel proud of course you're it for 'em fighting back in a way that that had no military um which means\nThat wouldn't come into way way later now looking back all of these years later I have a lot of respect for whatever that thing was it was able to scare me\nI felt like any ways like I I got my come up at five months after this whole episode in uh may\nIs when I got hit by a ... or car bomb\n[noise] and um [noise] even the fear was not as scary as that experience for the simple fact that I felt like if I caught around in the noodle I'd be dead if I got ripped apart by an explosion I'd be dead\nBut whatever was inside of that structure\nIt felt like if you were to die in its presence that it would have like a completely different set of consequences\nThan if you were to die just a out insect or somewhere\nLike a you could become like um trapped\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThank you down the same shit for sharing your story with us [noise] that's also wants to make his family and Suzanne for an encouraging him to share your stories Dallas just snapped listen we love it and listen to share their stories with this\nYou have a terrifying tale to tell about the salons speak steps that watches [noise] original soundscape was composed camp performed by ... the story was produced by Anna ...
