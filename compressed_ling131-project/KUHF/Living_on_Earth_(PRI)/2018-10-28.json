I like teachers so I took him to my house to see my pitches\n[noise]\nI got introduced to pigeons [noise] razor cages when I was maybe ten years old [noise]\nYou put them on your arm or something and give them a brain of corn and they were cool they relax you could you get rather back and they will squat down raise their feathers up [noise] pool and wings up and down and spread 'em and then\nWhen they wouldn't allow [noise] and to be able to walk out into the street with 'em and\nToss 'em up in there and watch 'em to say a little distance and it comes back\nTo you [noise] that was that was the magic you made a bird come back to you [noise]\n\nSo I was raising a pigeons in the makeshift who but built in the\nBack of our house where I live with my mom and my step dad and among like mostly kids we didn't have any real\nFormal coup so we make them on a piece of plywood bowls signs and posters even old television sets [noise]\nThere's one type of pigeon called rollers the rollers are different\nIn that they have this habit\nOf flipping an air we call it rolling but what they're really doing is slipping\n[noise]\nThe effect of that is the pigment would be flying and it would be like he stopped flying in mid air it starts falling out of the sky that's what it looks like and they slip and flip the better ones will do that almost two they hit the around and come back [noise] it's marvelous thing to see and we would jump up and down\nAnd scream and holler and clap our hands or encourage them to\nTo roll and you it'd be a bunch of us stand around flip and scream and holler [noise] come on come on come on slapping our hands together come on come on come on all of us had different calls ... and we would do that\nThese pages were off financially out of our means rural poor kids I'm picturing like that would probably cause six dollars in Nineteen I'm Seventy two Seventy three\nWhere we're okay we're bird you could get but if you had a roller\nKnow up to that point I hadn't had any rose\n[noise]\nWe're in the back yard he's really excited and he's comfortable with his you know he knew how to hold them the right way the way he smiles too with all the way he touched on this fresh air wing for\nHow they were comfortable with him the way he walked around the coup and pool that my wire and\nLooked at my nails and he smiled at me and we walked around the look to see what I was\nThe moment but the one thing [noise] I couldn't [noise]\nGet from him then was where you from [noise] where you stand man who you know folks is who you relate to what school you go to who is you know and he would give me nothing we wouldn't hang out\nMore and more we do more walking through the back alleys would spend more time in my\nBackyard and one thing in particular happen\n[noise] we're walking through the alley [noise] and then\nA lot of the alleys were dominated by adults [noise]\nOh St dog that would just take over and Alex and this was one of those cases and we've both just took off [noise]\n\nAnd we ran and ran and I didn't look back to see what the dog is doing I got about two blocks away and I was outta breath than a year we got away we were together with Lloyd Blankfein station we're friends now they do when I was he even read it hard\n[noise] but [noise] he wasn't there [noise] he wasn't with [noise]\nAnd I didn't see him again to the next day [noise]\nI was starting to feel funny about him and that didn't make sense it was scary it's like you disappeared you weren't there was no place to go [noise]\nI wanted to see him so badly the next day\n\nI was in the backyard with the pictures that turned around and day was and we went he went to the coup like she normally would do and I had to ask him way we do anything else were we play what what happened to you yesterday what'd you go [noise]\nAnd he gave me nothing [noise]\n\nWhen I mentioned to my mother about this boy to come and go and disappear\nTo speak [noise] my mother immediately told me stay away from [noise] just said stay away from she was afraid [noise]\nI didn't want to give 'em up [noise] I didn't want to [noise] wasn't like I had a lot of friends [noise] whatever it was it was good to me it was my friend [noise]\n\nI Would say it was a month later [noise] so we're probably in August and now [noise] and we're taking a huge will walk through the ...\nBehind the funeral home\nAnd we've been walking for a couple of blocks but we've started going to he was lead me in a direction that we never went before\n\n[noise] the this was the first time you've ever wanted to show me something I'm Still feel funny about\nHim\nAnd we walked about four or five or blogs and we stopped in front of the house\nIt previously been burned and it was partially burned down [noise] and was\nFalling apart and we and trees were growing up in the yard\nThat doesn't mean you're saying it's been burned so I'm thinking you must live somewhere\nNear around what what is it is a building here\nBut as I'm standing there and I look at the house I immediately remember\nThe house with a kid that and the fire now my heart's really starting to be fast [noise]\nAnd it gives me the impression that he wants me to [noise] to go inside the house [noise] and I want to I Want to leave [noise] but for whatever\nReason I couldn't move I don't mean like I was paralyzed and weird thing is I felt compelled to stay right there I see it through [noise] but I was scared on me and my I was getting those bombs [noise] I was breathing\nHard and then I started crying\n[noise] not move away [noise] but the kind of fear crying when tears just rolled down your face [noise]\nAnd I'm breathing hard I'm looking at him and I'm thinking you ain't that kid he got killed in a fire I Believe in that\n[noise] I'm trying to limit what am I thinking okay I'm On the wrong track with this right but it seems like he's I'm getting this data why can't move like children the fire [noise]\n[noise]\nAs soon as I pressed the tip of the ... into the\nSkin I felt that go in a tiny bit [noise]\nFor [noise]\nWhich [noise] I it was just a fraction of a second but [noise]\nI I definitely saw it that quit some flicks that little shiver and it startled me so I I dropped the squirrel and the nice and I expected it to jump up and run away [noise]\n\nI'd hoped it and convinced myself that [noise]\nIt was a dead squirrel like I mean obviously it was a squirrel [noise]\nSo I still myself picturesque world backup\nGot the exact blade and\nLike ripping off a band aid I just I stuck to the knife in and dragged it down the spine lines [noise]\n[noise]\nHi I'm Ruth my hands and the blade got at some point where I can get my hands around its stomach in between the skin and the body [noise] and then I started working its little arms five just popping them backwards through the skin and got at skinned out so it was almost like\nIt was wearing a Wednesday of its own skin [noise]\nAnd the final part was a cutting the ... [noise] I\nSuddenly had a really sharp pain [noise] underneath the knuckle um the pinky on my right hand [noise]\nMy drop this girl I dropped the blade and I look\nAt my hands [noise] the glove had actually been torn open [noise] and\nUnderneath that there were four short [noise] rats marks on my skin all really close together [noise]\nSo I took off the damage blood and as I was doing that [noise] I noticed a little tiny bit of movement who may peripheral vision so I looked back up at the world [noise] and it was lying on the table [noise]\nAnd I saw the four\nFingers on its toll on slowly curl up into a little fist hold for a second and then really slowly relax [noise]\nYeah that's me up [noise]\nI just I panicked [noise] having these feelings [noise] scenes affirming [noise]\nI can explain that whatever that's just my own brain [noise] being a deck [noise] having a a\nSquirrel pa wound on my hand was much harder to explain away\nMaybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation\nIs that I just skin to the squirrel alive [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop [noise]\nIt felt like I was going to be cursed from that point on to never have another good\nExperience with taxidermy which would be devastating like what if I'm done what if it's going to be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out\nBut if I had given up it would have been a huge step backwards\nI hopped on a new glove clipped the risks and the ah ankles up the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt so that it could\nDehydrate and put her on the shelf underneath my ah underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and\n[noise]\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was thriving and every time it throbbing I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up and all I had to do is change to solve it can't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday\n[noise]\nI took the big bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside\nThe skin was sitting\nUp halfway out of the salt as if it did for road up for air like I'd been zombie getting up from its grave\n[noise]\nIt was just sitting there staring at me with these empty islands [noise]\nThe little ties kind of sticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the dead holiday we're always pushed it way up to ten pounds so there was also no way that anybody has touched it because they all think it's disgusting [noise]\n\nI just dumped out the salt [laughter] very they began put it on the shelf and walked away\nFrom it for I expected it to be a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my coffee I heard a squirrel start barking [noise]\nAnd I\nIt's just for a second I froze because I'm thinking oh my God it's bits back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that I was\nSo afraid of it also used to nibble and Kate burn scanner and learn and [noise] um [noise] bearing nuts and\nIt just kind of just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had [noise] I don't know dignity [noise] I went back to the salt and um you know the\n... was actually still in there and it hadn't or tried to escape again [noise] but I just opened it up I felt like I owe them an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I didn't listen\nBecause I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started the only thing that I Want to do is preserve you and make you last forever\nSo the next morning I woke up\nAnd I walked out on the porch it looked up in the big oak tree that's right over the fence I saw um a brown squirrels not medium size\nReally bushy tailed with a white tip [noise]\n\nThe ... that was identical to the one I mean you know currently modifying under ten pounds of salt in a tub a few feet away from me\nHow common is that if it had like the idea of health that like I I'm In fact it they're like snowflakes you know\n[noise]\nI just wanted to see what would happen so\nI took an almond between my Simon named her [noise] and I just held it out and sure enough the squirrel\nJumped from the tree onto the railing of my balcony and hopped along the railing until it got to my hand maybe my hand was shaking like crazy this\nCultural sniff me so close that I felt it snows on my fingertips [noise] and then it grabs the home and then it's teeth\nTurned around [noise] hopped over to the other end of the fence jump to the tree climbed up back to that branch and looked at me again\n[noise] and we just made eye contact for another couple of seconds [noise] and it just dashed back up into the tree [noise] it just\nIt was like a disappeared before even reached the top of the branches [noise]\nSo I was just be completely re energized and I was finally I finally knew what I was going to do with\nThe squirrels help so show me so well here I've got to take the pins out of its face that's all try now that's been try for ages\nYeah so he's going to be holding his own\nLittle skull\nHow are you feeling about doing that are you a little bit more apprehensive now I got to be
