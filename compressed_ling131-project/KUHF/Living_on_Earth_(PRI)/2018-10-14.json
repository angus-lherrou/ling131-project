exploited three bugs and Facebook's code to gain access to users accounts they didn't get any passwords but they didn't have to they were able to act just like they were logged in\nBut I didn't immediately or register that fact um because when he stood out to make room for me to sit on his Rob\nI'm I noticed that he was covered from the waist down in blood he was completely saturated\nStarted pointing to the blood on his parents [noise] yeah it was it was [noise] Mm\nThe curies off of his name was ... and he was signaling to them secretly that these kidnappers had already killed three other cookies officers\nI think he saw the look on my face which was probably action any held up three fingers and many he swipe one finger across as throw\nIt seemed as if up those men were not cookies [noise] there was some kind of militant rebel and they were preparing to move the whole group somewhere else\nAnd if they want to move somewhere that means they have to be somewhat kind to us we didn't have a lot of things that we were going to be able to exploit and that was one of them we could export cooperation our level of cooperation\nDoing his men broke down camp took all the supplies that could carry and began to march everyone at gunpoint over the rugged terrain the climbers and the other hostage trot had no choice but to a bay\nAnd then suddenly above them\nThere was a new even deadly or threat\nCourteous helicopters military helicopters started to fly around overhead and that's when\nEverything changed\nIt got really frantic\nIn what had been a silent Himalayan valley just a few hours earlier a firefighter wrapped it up to pointed out to the helicopter in mind go hide or we will shoot the to the hostages belly crossing the brush suddenly they were dodging bullets from every which way\nThe helicopter was shooting from above and more curry soldiers crusted hill and we're closing in on the rebels who are also returning fire\nThere's a lot a machine gun fire they had this kind of things started to fly there's these murders and shoot it and you know this whistling noise and you hear it coming towards you and then there'd be an explosion [noise]\nI'm Still in the house just through the brush exacting from tree to treating they ran for our up and down sharp steep gorges alongside fast moving river\nAnd so we kind of escape the on the line of sight of the soldiers um and we weren't running across as plateau to the adjacent valley\nTruck came over and sat next to me\nAnd he put his hand on my knee any squeezed it really really tightly and he looked me right in the face and he pointed across as valley\nAnd he said I'm going to die over there and I kind of degree I think anybody would do which is to lie to him and to tell him that we were all in this situation together and everything going to be okay and [noise]\nUh he told me to shut up and he said listen to me\nI mean a die over there and that means that you need to do something about the situation\nOnly moments later ... motion for the group to move behind a large Boulder out that Boulder where they were\nSold at us and told us he got one at a time in ... was the first one to go I'm so ... went up there and then as soon as he got there they shot him point blank and\n[noise] the four of us um had to come up after that and sort of walk around the Boulder and see him lying there was a pool of blood coming out of his head and then we had to basically crouching lay on top of his body for the next hour or two until we finally fled to sing the battle\nNight south and the adrenaline was starting to wear off we finally got up to this ridge where [noise]\nUm we were able to stop and sit down\nAnd\nWe had we had a break and there was kind of a very strange\nFeeling the crossfire it was done helicopter was gone but their food water and supplies for also gone\nAnd so we ended up with just a few things in our pockets which I think there's a power bars or a three musketeers bar\n... scattered during the firefight\nNow there was only three men left up to himself to the shy one and oh they're the only one\nOver at a few pieces of heart candy that he shared he pulled five hundred matters pocket any kind of looked around at the other people other than himself and you could see him during the ... and he ended up taking one of the pieces and giving my friends that I the other four pieces\nAnd I think that for me that was a moment I knew that we could beat this if we just played our cards right\nUp till had relaxed a little bit the climbers we're no longer at gunpoint and there was an unspoken agreement that everyone stay together that is until they came to this river [noise]\nFast raging river and they were having a hard time with it they started trying to\nFigure this just falling trees and\nAnd and get it across the river to make a bit of a bridge and Jason I'm decided in this moment that he was going to help them and I didn't understand why\nI don't swim and I'm like a cat in the water so I Would actually terrified so I just committed I charged out there and I just\nGrabbed the laws and [noise]\nPlowed into this region\nThe water was like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the flood\nAnd I got about three quarters of the way across and uh I've ended up stepping off the phone and I'm finding into the main current and I was right at the top of a waterfall\nI thought to myself like a nice for it yet because now you're going to hurt relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked it also get the get the log cross the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this law get get across the river\nAnd ... came over and I was reaching out my hand in trying to grab his hand employ them up in the rock and he was terrified of rocking log [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection as to why I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was I thought that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\n[noise] they looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and and to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood\nWas that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and then my own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life and\nThey're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to exposed a repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believe that they could not count on rent them rescue their best shot at living with to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself we're pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see are actors as as evil as you might think even though we are seeing them murders somebody I very much a\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nWalk away with it\nI knew that he was facing the death penalty for half a dozen different charges you know invading a foreign country taking people kept it all the kinds of things and I felt really sorry for him he was\nA Nineteen year old car really had a real innocent kind of air about him I didn't want to say anything in front of the army that might contribute to him getting the death
