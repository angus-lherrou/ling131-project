day\nSo I I ah I left home um\nLeg is filled up but\nI'd left Detroit\nEnded up in a homeless shelter\nCouldn't hold down a job\nFor the next several years\nAfterwards uh all I can do\nI was very consumed with the fact that I didn't have any\nAny family and if in angered me [noise]\nI made sure I got plenty screwed up\nEvery single night of the week so I began to party allied um raves and LSD and\nEcstasy forty three now\nFor me out\nBack and that still\nWe're not married but she and I have been together for seven years now and we have a wonderful son awesome shit man\nThe complete opposite of what I was his age happy\nMy son he looked at me one day when I yelled at him he sure [noise]\nOh my God that was me I looked at my kid and a hundred or so sorry\nI Do not want to make you afraid of me\nBut sometimes I've been afraid you know that\nI've become my dad\nI moved here to California in Nineteen Ninety seven and uh I didn't see any of my family although I spoke to them on the phone all except my dad I didn't see anyone\nWe were experiencing some financial difficulties here and we were on the verge of an eviction yeah we were both unemployed\nSpoken to my sister and a number of occasions and my mom or conversations with him had been going well over the past few years or so\nAnd so I reason that it'd be a good idea\nTo get my family\nTo Detroit where we'd have support\nIn making making a life ourselves\n[noise] no I was not without extreme reservation doubt I was afraid that\nWe were not only fail at getting our feet on on the ground but [noise] that's something dress all my house [noise] but [noise] I had\nThe irrational [noise] I'd been longing for my family for very long\nAnd I've been missing [noise]\nFor some reason I thought maybe you know we can go from here we're adults [noise] a lot of time has passed maybe we can meet halfway each other half\n[noise] so we arrive in Detroit and get to my mom's house and\n[noise] my mom fell back into one of her a cat a tonic states and now I Know I'm gonna see my dad after all these years\n\nSo he arrives at the house and we didn't hug\nI don't believe we shook hands I think\nNeither of us at that moment knew how to proceed but I watched him kneel down and get on a level with my son and speak to him just as if he were another adult\nMost of them didn't know each other all they had in common was that they were writers and at some point they wrote something for the Washington Post\nMy name is Daryl horn and I'm a novelist brighter Darryl Horne was at home trying to get her four kids ready for school when she decided to just take a quick look at our inbox\nWhen I looked at my messages I saw the title of the message was saving all like I say so I have people throwing lego at me and the sort of thing while I'm reading\nThe message and fighting about who's going to get in the car first in this kind of thing and this person is writing to me saying this is my last day on earth\n[laughter]\nWhile they're at debated what to do around the same time in another city entirely a guy named Ron Charles opened his inbox\nOn the book editor of book world at the Washington Post\nWe get you know you can imagine hundreds of pieces of mail there every day from people desperate to get reviewed or published\nEverybody insist that they know that we get a lot of pictures but in this case their book is really special and if we would just read it if we could just open it and read that first chapter you know we would see but you know if you get thirty of these missions as a day for Seventeen years\nIt's easy to get you know a little skeptical\nHere's ... again it almost felt like an emotional mugging but it felt a little bit um I don't want to say manipulative because that that implies a kind of malice that I don't think this person had but it felt unfair I feel guilty even thinking of it that way because I Know that's wrong to feel that way\nThere are Cynthia Enron never met each other all they had in common was the Washington Post and now they all had to figure out what to do about this email\nI was just looking for clues in the email is how I could find this person she mentions that he's in Japan or he gives it provides an email address for his ex wife\nSo I wrote a brief note to this woman just said you know do you ever met them you're mentioned at the bottom of the suicide note\nI forwarded the message I said I received it is disturbing message I Hope that you may be in a position to help this person\nIf there isn't anything you can do there was anything we can do please let us know you know Ron Charles Washington post and then\nI just moved on with my day\nCindy I'm the one who ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and ... relatives than it is nice on Facebook and message turn\nIn the messages sent to apologize for getting in touch this way and then explain that she thought Dennis ... should know that her uncle might be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and\nMy daughter was in school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember laying on the ground and we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay\nCynthia didn't hear back from done is not the next day or the day after that or the day after that Cynthia didn't stop thinking about him\nAnd then one day she heard back from his niece and\nShe said thank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n[noise]\nI was just got it is the best way to describe it felt I felt like someone to punch me in the stomach\nThat feeling lasted for\nDays and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his butt\nLingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reached out to establish that\nConnection and that that it hadn't worked out the way I'm Better movie version of it whatever are down where I Would have somehow figured out a way to save him\n...\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis was in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about Dennis his death bed like Cynthia there hadn't stopped wondering what happened to them is\nAs upsetting as it was when she and I were sort of talking about the timing and it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children are running over my house he was already dead\nThis horrible too but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would have made any difference I don't know I mean why who cares whether it makes any difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it but you know our our lives are predicated on this got a cold this though right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night would it have made any difference\nAnd Cynthia talk to his ex wife cake out she found out that Dennis ... always plan on doing this he always said what he had said in the email when his work was done so does he have a strange none of this was at\nAll surprised the cake out [noise]\nGet emailed her to right before he killed himself\nHe asked her not to be sad\nWhen he went up to the roof of his hotel\n\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months of the top end there's\nSome folks who say well you know could you have done more and ... where are you being cold\nAbout it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything he specifically says that in part of the ladder um he just wanted as ideas to survive [noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he didn't raise and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook and blog up just in case someone got curious\nAbout his work that was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that\nThis was what was important in his life and nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill himself because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I I've been very fortunate to have\nHad a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to see this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but it would never occur to me that\nMy writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another Alan ... a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet and Hebrew literature and I'll say that\nWhen you study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um\n[noise] I just I was upset at the idea that what\nWould matter most about a person's life would be their work every person has a legacy\nYou may not know what your impact is and it may not be something that you can write on your tombstone\nUm but every person has an impact on this world\nSo anyway let's say you were successful writer and you published your books and people read them let's say you were an amazingly successful writer and people even read them after you were dead\nLet's say you're really\nSuccessful and people read them a hundred years later I mean you know it's like well how far are we going here\nEventually you know they're going to find your name on a credit card in a landfill\nThere is Cynthia Enron all went back to their lives back to their kids their hobbies back to their writing none of them have taken an interest and then as his work\nSo dances worked just sits there in the back rooms of the Internet he does have one book on Amazon the one that got published although there isn't a lot of evidence that many people have visited his page it's pretty barren no authors bio no picture the only clear evidence that anyone has read his book is a single solitary\nReview\nAs positive five stars I got curious who wrote it so I emailed her\nReview it turns out was written by his daughter [noise]\nShe [laughter] she [laughter] she she she the\nBig things to be able to pay more Ron Charles ... chemical subtle Paul Sarah one Leon Morimoto our son to sign up
