U. H. T. T. V. eight point six years to the surface of the University of Houston I'm Jared and ... and this is news eighty eight seven\nOh [noise]\nOne of my friends\nHave\nOne world Trade Center in Manhattan New York or radio our protection of ... studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like they do work in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York\nBut another story in this election is the very opposite the candidates who are running as extremists on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran has been covering the movement known as the old right and he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... for example who was involved in pizza gate and you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore\nWe've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why\nBecause he was ... tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he ... he denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done so Steve\nKing is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability an interest in the last couple of years\nPartly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere is no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kind of gets called to the mat and says\nFigure that out and then the course of that discovered that Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security advisor um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions but then the situation got a lot worse because people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come ... vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it suits or black males so what does it what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told them that I needed to come see him right away told him\nWhat we had learned that you know the vice president of bid on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you've got the VP out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn\nHow we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd when you go see 'em a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same way it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and\nI you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was\nWhat's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another and what did you make of that [noise] um\nWell I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which God that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is\nProblematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public that that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh loss on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um banning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow ... and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order and she said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nShow how did you find out about the travel there\nUm I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd get a call I was able to keep one a with name on a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says that after you left you know I went on line I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend I'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House um [noise] what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nUm it's it's kinda hard to know which whatever I think he thinks will be best for him\nUm the the president appoints the attorney general you see the president's lawyer is he the people's lawyer what's what's what is the role and what's the relationship what should it be because it's it's not a simple thing you\nKnow and and and I get that a lot of people might look and say look the department of justice is part of the executive branch just like the department of agriculture commerce or any of the other agencies and you answered the president or the president's lawyer\nThat is so not true and I remember actually when I first became us attorney and we all went to the White House for what was essentially a photo op I'm with Eric Holder the attorney general then\nAnd you know we're all lined up in the bleachers in the East Room there for the president to come in and and\nYou know he comes in and and he looked at us there and said look I have pointed each and every one of you and I know you're going to do a great job but there's only one thing you need to remember and that is you don't represent me\nYou represent the people of the United states and as long\nAs you remember that [noise]\nThey're going to do your job and everything's going to be OK so two\nThousand nine yeah yeah um [noise] let me read you I'm a ... [noise]\nI'm from from ... President Trump um\n... which really it's a little ... into the criminal justice a dementia\nI'm very sad that the FBI missed all the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter this was the Parkland shooting at high school a vicious not acceptable\nThey're spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no conclusion get back to the basics and make us all proud I I Know you're a it's just you can't be at a loss for words the New Yorker festival okay\n[noise]\nSickening I mean he's taking a tragedy where children were killed and he is using that tragedy\nTo attack\nAnd investigation of his own campaign what what\nEffect do you think this the kind of criticism in the OJ the criticism and the FBI has day to day\nWell let me see what effect I don't think it has for okay I don't think it impacts the substantive decisions that are being made bottom line prosecutors on the line age it's their\nBooks having confidence in the O. J. and and the FBI that has real life consequences agents come knocking on doors to try to find witnesses or others to provide information in cases when you were showing that kind of distrust\nThat has a real impact on public safety when juries are sitting in trials\nAnd are hearing testimony from FBI agent and they're thinking about what their president is set about how you know they're liars and all you know part of the deep state trying to undermine this administration\nThat can help but have an impact there and I think that you know the the public's confidence in our criminal justice system is essential for that system to be able to work\nAnd that to me as one of the ... the great tragedies of all of this is how that's being abused ... one of the things I really worry about is we're our way when this administration is over\nI mean what's the new normal at that point what have we sewed to based not just public discourse but\nThe the dignity of the presidency and Congress and the department of justice and others that we look and are entirely different than we were before\nHow's that for oh God oh my God [laughter] cut to present myself [laughter]\nUm you you are now a partner at ... being from a lot of them want you to run for office is that\nGoing to happen [noise]\nI Do I get that reactor [laughter] I pander with the best for them yet so I'm\nYou know when when people have mentioned that on I'm incredible flat or don't even feel like the right word there I mean it it means a lot to me that people have said that they would like me to do that or would trust me to do that um [noise]\nPublic service absolutely I mean that's in the heart and I believe in that running for office just feels very different to me than that I just have a hard time seeing\nBut if but if a different president wanted to call you back to Washington wouldn't be out of the question for you to go out I Believe in public service there we go [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask Me Another", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
