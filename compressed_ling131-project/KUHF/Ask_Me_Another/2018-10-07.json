WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nIf you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long the way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake change disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subjective Rebecca Traister his new book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement Traister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation\nRebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the\nSenate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as we near us and in others it in a very particular ... what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we're getting a very full and detailed view of\nCultures around wealth\nWhite fundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite um friday\nHard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free\nUm social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on pads toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nAbout sexual harassment and sexual assault was old shocking to him shocking to me\nAnd he's coming to you in some way for what you call feminist absolution so what's to be learned here what can you tell him and really by extension what can you tell me\nWell I think that this I my hope is that this is a moment of education and readjustment of the view of of ... a full human experience for a lot of men who have just not seeing\nThe ...\nHave not realize how common how ubiquitous how every day these kinds of ... this is part of opening the men are learning something about the experience of not being men in the world that would have been\nMuch of the learning comes out in terms of defensiveness were\nFirst some for some and it's a process and I don't I don't I don't worry about\nYou know thinking about oh my God in high school maybe I said something terrible I made a bad joke in the office that is what year\nOld for all of my anger and it's and and this is an angry book that I've written than I Am very angry at men and I talk about the complexities of\nUm the tricks of a women's movement or a feminist movement is it asks you to identify as your oppressor a group of people who are your intimate your loved ones you're the menu share beds within families with and who are your brothers in your father's in your sons and your friends it asks of us to\nComplicate those incredibly intimate relationships that are often loving and that are often based in need independents on who the man on whom we rely I really do feel for the men for whom this is difficult we are changing rules\nPartway through the game that's what this process is asking us to do that is hard\nBut there's no other way to do it we don't get to just start fresh with a generation starting now right if you actually want to change the way that the power structures work and the abuses that they permit and you want to say actually we don't want to have those abuses anymore we want to make them them\nNo longer acceptable that is going to mean that there are some people who are caught in the middle who entered the world with one set of expectations\nAnd one set of assumptions about how they could behave and are being told halfway through that that's no longer acceptable\nAnd that is really that has a cost has a toll and I do feel for those guys that doesn't mean that I don't think the process is necessary and I stand behind it and I don't think I'm Alone in this most of the people that I Know who are\nFervent proponents of the me too movement and if this difficult painful process are incredibly conflicted about it too we don't want to be the police who determine if somebody should lose their job or not lose their job\nAnd a lot of the ... to staff said oh it lacks nuance and it's just a bunch of execution or you know everybody I Know who is behind this movement you know most um intensely and fervently feels incredible conflict and so I feel\nTremendous sympathy for the guys to\nThe book and it's remarkable one is good and bad Rebecca Traister thanks so much thanks so much for having me David [noise]\nRebecca Traister his new book is called good and
