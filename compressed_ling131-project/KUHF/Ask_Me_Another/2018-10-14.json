mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen\nHe was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages\nOn Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody

started poking around the Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections such an assault dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports were public presentations\nAnd this this particular search didn't turn that up instead I found it very\nSeriously and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wild but that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected immediately\nI thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which
