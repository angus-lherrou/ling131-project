David Remnick the midterm elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year\nIn the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff that is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter a lawsuit Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nShe stood in front of some heavy machinery\nTo block the equipment from digging on our land and she'd also Puerto noxious cocktail Iran said milk and Tabasco sauce as well as laid rotten cat food near\nWhere the pipeline workers were working in order to make their jobs uncomfortable she'd actually gone to jail over that\nBut she'd recently been released and showed us the ongoing construction\nFrom a safe distance for this this is our wet and this is still part of our wetland area that gets a little foggy and it gets rocky okay we're we're\nSo we're fine okay [noise] famous last words right the construction\nThey've been so controversial in contentious at the gas hearts that pipeline workers carry cameras and they photographed us as we stood by the\nWork site [noise] recording right now [noise] this guy has a camera in his hand has a video a video camera they typically use [noise] um [noise] security usually has like\nAlan and our daughter Elise head to organize what they called camp white pine on the forest and part of their property to try to block the pipeline\nThrough social media they'd called on other protesters who came with the expertise to set up this sophisticated network of police and sip wires that allowed protesters to harness and clip into the trees to block chainsaws from clearing the lead\nAt one point they had six activists sitting in their trees I spoke with a lease the daughter at their kitchen table\nAt least do you think with the election of Trump this makes any difference in this issue [noise]\nI mean I think people find it easy to blame these things on from [noise] but Obama was already doing it anyway and in Pennsylvania we have a democratic governor who is watching all this stuff go down and he\n[noise]\nHe watched what happened to us and to everybody else along this line and all the bills and all the contamination of wells and the destruction of the forest and [noise] now retired teachers being thrown in jail and\nHe still talks about how this project is necessary and and good you know so that's what you get what the\nDemocrats [noise] you know people around here just don't for the most part don't get involved with politics a lot of people don't vote [noise]\nBecause they don't see value in it because they haven't been valued by those people who have been in the positions of power [noise]\nSo what does it matter you know like I mean folks down in southeast PA were able to like actually physically meet with the governor over this pipeline hasn't given about meeting with us you know like you've never got come out here to meet with people that just never going to happen\nThey don't care about us they don't even the U.S [noise]\nUm there's a huge Gulf between what people along this pipeline thinking possible how they think politics can actually impact their lives and it has to do with economics\nFor the gear harden living in isolated in rural Pennsylvania the idea that a blue wave could save them just doesn't exist that politics for CNN\nNot reality but for Daniel ... running for state assembly and the more prosperous suburbs politics is part of\nThe solution Danielle would like to see the pipeline stopped but even if Democrats took control of the legislature which is unlikely there's no guarantee that they would stop but it's even less likely that the pipeline will change the outcome of Pennsylvania's congressional races and make it a blue or said again\nStill Danielle is playing a long game like Democrats all over the country she's trying to rebuild the party's presence on the ground in local offices and in people's backyards\nDon't do it like we talk about all the time I talk all the time about how through my own race I'm actually going to find people for next year's municipal elections because the more people to the more people have talked a Democrat somewhere they vote for Democrats\nSo it's a I think it's a it's like a flatter like you're building a ladder and [noise] if you're missing the wrong or the runs on the other side and you can't step up it's not like [noise] if you're not going to successful [noise]\n\nLogic Griswold reported from Pennsylvania and you can find everything she's written for a New Yorker dot com [noise] and our coverage of the midterm elections continues next week with Dan ... who's been reporting from Wisconsin on an electronics plant that was one of Donald Trump's signature promises on the campaign trail [noise]\nIn the

you played an explorer of the Amazon the poet Allen Ginsberg an FBI agent undercover with neo Nazis she started the drama across the musical how succeed in business without ...\nTry and you know I didn't forget it he was an all three hundred Harry Potter movies\nRight now Daniel Ratcliffe is in a new play called the lifespan of the fact and this may be the only work in theater ever written to give a leading role to a fact checker and injustice I may say that we're all glad to see rectified\nYou know the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Ratcliffe wanted to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand here's Peter can be who runs the fact checking department\nSo they know where I cooked showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York\n[noise] Hi [noise] hello how are you [laughter]\nAnd he didn't look unlike under ... and I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the difficult writer\nBecause of because one of one of the\nPolicy the citizens of flows five and I'm a business or something like ... asking if I see a U.S no ability to differentiate between ... one of the schools that seem to matter in the same job as a sort of gifts for whites to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't are familiar with that second most exciting things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and release of Indians alone but to us the bigger the biggest thing that we\nWork on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm not really a science more kind of them are just kind of a ... other things you may there are kind of common sense will judgments that you make of course that's a sort of squishy ground\nTo make it such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we should show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like God I Believe you have a phone call scheduled for the chef of a Mexican restaurant or whatever [laughter] yeah when you train them down so we're I mean that\nWould be

saying what does open seasonings seasoning on so then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both to off the website and then check was chef yeah Austin for your call is set up for the eleven why what's\nGoing to say that wrong I ... I\nWould have never heard of it a dissimilar to the beaches soupy or what you do do you also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you would [noise] us back off and maybe\nSee a a case like lava yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you\nThis research to it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach is that I think the problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like a California speech static um\n\nAfter you're done with this will set up a job interview [laughter] she wrote a switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right now [laughter] so that pressure [noise]\nAfter I saw that Daniel brag who have had a good from ... grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another the tractors them one of my deputy businesses\nThat are in the high dollar down anyhow I talked to last may\nWhen the house on", "show_name": "Ask Me Another", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "28"}
