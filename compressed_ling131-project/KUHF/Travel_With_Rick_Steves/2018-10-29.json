{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUHF", "content": "A man named Robert Taft he's a senator from a variety of what happens is Eisenhower gets the nomination thanks to the support of\nEastern Republicans especially Henry Cabot Lodge junior from Boston and people who are angry about Robert Taft losing the nomination begin to complain that an eastern elite is determining the course of the nation and you see that picked up from the reactionary Republicans who become known as the movement conservative\nFrom that point on and you see it really dramatically of course with Eisenhower's nomination but then you see it with the rise of Reagan who goes out of his way when he supports Goldwater and then when he runs for president himself\nTo really take pot shots at Harvard education than to say you know I'm from a little college in California you don't need that highfalutin education\nThat really gets picked up until you get this trend in the modern day GOP that says you know we're the representative of the people were not the eastern elite even when you get leaders who are you know Harvard and Yale educated\nAnd let me go back to look at the cyclical things you were talking about earlier these periods of crisis Seventeen nineties obviously beauty fifties in the civil war the Eighteen nineties we heard a lot in this program about the Nineteen twenties and thirties\nDo you see any common factors that helped us get through it I guess we should not considered civil war as a reasonable solution but what what else\nWell one of the things that Lawrence Jacob said that I thought was really interesting was\nHow important the lack of faith in the government is because while it sparks a crisis sure you know the government's not responding to me and therefore I hate the government and I want to destroy the government that's one angle that you can take with that sort of an attitude\nThe other thing you can get from distrust of government is the idea that if government leaders are not actively working for you you need to recreate government at the grassroots level\nAnd then all of the period we're talking about that's exactly what happened the Eighteenth fifties the Eighteen nineties the Nineteen thirties and now the present you have people at the town level at the state level\nOrganizing deciding what they really want to have for their communities and taking those ideas and putting forth their own candidates who will end their turn change the way we think about government so this moment looks very much like those other moments\nWhen in fact the the country turned on a dime and changed from what seemed to be a governmental pattern written in stone to being something completely different in really what seemed at the time like a heartbeat every time I hear oh you know history takes forever and you know it's all glacial I think you know that's absolutely right\nExcept when it's wrong and when it's wrong society can turn on a dime look at the fact that Herbert Hoover won by a landslide in Nineteen twenty eight and in Nineteen thirty to FDR won by a landslide and you would never have thought in twenty eight\nThat the country would have turned entirely in a different direction in only four years\nYou know we heard from Lawrence Jacobs a obviously a deep concern about where we are today about the inequality gap and it's corrosive effect but it also sounds like a huge share his his optimistic\nI Do share his optimism cosmetically because I Believe in the concept of human self determination and I believe that that's really what humans want especially what Americans want and that in the end of the concept of human self determination inequality before the laws is going to win out\nIt's almost a religious faith to be honest that being said we are in time that looks to me more dangerous than any before in our history because it's not at all clear to me with the technologies we have and with the laws that are in place and with the changes that we have made\nTo our political norms and to our Supreme Court that the free and fair vote of the American people is in fact going to be heard so you know I'm I'm optimistic cosmetically I think that this is going to turn out right in the end the question is is the end in six months\nTwo years four years ten years uh we're still at a knife edge I'm not ready to to break out the party hats\nYet [noise] next time on the democracy test consent of the government have voting rights expanded in America and how the legitimacy of our elections is challenged by voter
