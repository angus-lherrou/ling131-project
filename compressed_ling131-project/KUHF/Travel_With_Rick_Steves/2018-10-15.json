be at its best and hope for the future and what it sounds like to me is you're sort of saying that\nIf you want to play baseball which we do if it's if you equate baseball's democracy if you want to play baseball you got to play by the rules and if you're not playing by the rules\nWith people who are also playing by the same rules and talking about the same game you really can't play democracy at all and this is why we need the rules this is why we need people involved in this is why we need people to be talking about the same game is that fair analogy do you think\nThat is a fair analogy um I think part of that further challenges that while you're playing baseball you're also always thinking a little about tweaking the rules of the game right and then that's what makes it so hard\nBecause you know gosh we're playing a game you know what you want to change the rules of the game over the middle of the game like how can you do that at cetera et cetera and passions right but that's

expecting to keep the losers in the game too if we can rebuild that knowledge and the habits that go with it there's no reason we can't recover from our current situation\nDaniel Allen thank you so
