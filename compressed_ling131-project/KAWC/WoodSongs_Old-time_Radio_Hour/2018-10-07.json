christopherson right now and she's really a supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tributes on record the certainly appropriate for her\nWe'll have [noise] and I see and I see around\nAnd so you're you're Tom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound and you as an artist you are interested in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun record say this is something you were interested in this little kid or does come out\nWell yeah I mean I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of it as a child\nI became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I'm not\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever move the Memphis and then I moved there about twelve Thirteen Years ago and\nI'm just really got to be a full time student in Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis thing kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know I'm you know but ah yeah and and then the Memphis sounded so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing and if a state of unrest stacks records Hi Records are to\nYou know there's the the uh there's there's not a Memphis Sound there are Memphis Sounds you know\nWell and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son records Amy you worked at sun records as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy orbits and Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nNotice this stage you might be bigger than the actual tacking round one car garage really was radiator shot it was a ... law\nIt has these white stick tiles I'm a law aimed at forever his best day this child\nAnd the ending was real and had this little metal peaks and valleys all along the tap into the room like how they found in there and then one big glass window in family ... looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Philips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually and I actually knew senator sat\nDown there and they built it pretty they built a whole nother studio down names treatment they were the storefront to look just like it inside there because they honor is fine with respect for people\nLooking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk along which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually um I actually knew senator set\nBuilders and they built it pretty they built a whole nother studio down main street meant they were the storefront to look just like it inside there because they the owner is fine with respect to the people that come from all over the world\nTo see time studio that he didn't want to curb it to the public\nFilming said they had to build that\nThey had to build their own\nWe had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours courage though we did the daytime ...\nOperating studio the Iranian idea but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same recording board that they had the old arc deal to this whole new stuff yeah ... yeah old stuff new old\nDon't have the actual the actual gear they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that needed to go around and make field according to bring it back in the museum and that's really cool things in the studio at\nNew all the actual console that same additives that the rock and roll museum\nThat they actually do exist as just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props has do again I mean it's amazing how good those records found even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it was a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam's tulips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul Keim is a tune called red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the wood songs old time\n\nUh then oh alone childcare there is a good thing you do me around\nA\nHuman than what it was a um\nYou real to care\nUsing drew\nYou use\n...\n... do you add the regular day
