to be here let's talk about Django Reinhardt it is what he's doing on the guitar you are doing on a hammer do summer that I mean that's a whole different uh ... I mean explain this well [noise]\nI don't I've got a lot of explaining to do I suppose [laughter] there's there's a a ancestor to the hammer adult summer in Europe called the symbolism and it's a real central uh instrument in a gypsy Roma culture\nParticularly in the Eastern Europe or regions are in folk music I'm so there was a real strong connection in terms of a gypsy culture with its instrument what you'll find a less of is the application of hum a gypsy swing the jazz stuff of Django on\nThe instrument so when you first tried it\nHow much whiskey was involved\nIn trying to take Shane goes music and interpret it on a hammer adults were cause I mean what what he's doing with two fingers on frets you're doing with hammers yeah two cameras though so maybe it won't have to harm us two fingers so seriously this is this is a complicated thing that you're interpreting yeah this is not easy\nYeah no I I avoided it for years and I'm\nA good friend of mine in Chicago alfonzo pun a chili he kept\nSwing the jazz stuff of Django on instrument\nSo when you first tried it how much whiskey was involved\nIn trying to take Shane goes music and interpret it on a hammer do from a cause I mean what what he's doing with two fingers on frets you're doing with hammers yeah two cameras though so maybe it won't work to harm us two fingers Seattle seriously this is this is a complicated thing that you're interpreting yeah this is not easy\nYeah no I I avoided it for years and I'm\nA good friend of mine in Chicago alfonzo pun a chili he kept saying you should learn that on this you should learn this music on the instrument\nAnd I just thought it couldn't be done and then I I heard a assembling player I'm from Holland or a guy by the name of John ... Khan who are played wonderfully and even though it's a different tuning scheme altogether I just thought yeah I Need\nTo figure this case so this is what let's talk about your camera do summer sure Kay uh it it is it is a beautiful sounding instrument but our ... you say you're tuning it differently\nSince yeah there is an American tuning um that's kind of based around um the cycle of if I Want to get into all that but um yeah it's great for folk tunes um and uh\nIt's still you know it's it's playing gypsy swing or really any kind of jazz on the instrument is still pattern based there are actually shapes that I'm following the kind of work like gee cheat but there are a little bit bigger than your typical shapes that you follow it\nAnd for the radio audience I mean the the hammer do summers is sitting in front of you as like almost like a tilted card table right and it's got a\nZillion strings that you don't get into ... fourteen years to tune it [laughter] but\nBut it it is it they are tune to a patterns like you said so you're you're actually aiming with your hammer and you don't miss often yeah I Do you just don't know to see you're playing so fast\nWe can see right that's right exactly well\nLet's get back into the music of Django Reinhardt and you're going to invite the lovely a Andy to come up and she is going to sing vocal on a song that is not necessarily I'm associated with the Django Reinhardt but you're going to the ... going to recognize\nThe tune actually singing it's from his CD swing more to the tune is called ain't misbehave and it is Andy young hammered dulcimer champion on the ... sauce [noise]\nNo not at\nAll times and I\nKnow a lot but um\nYeah and then have them\nOn saving for you [noise]\nI Know\nWhy\nI'm through with it\nAnd then they have\nThey been going\nIn the car\nNo no no\nWe saw\nIn the me I Do not have made\nNo I'm home I buy me\nAnd then they have that\nOn the then my\nCar [noise]\nWait in oh then\nLee me I Do not stay out late [noise]\nKnow I'm home I buy me\nAmen then hey then\nAnd then my\n...

um rare\nAnd you're being my this is Brian also grow inviting you to join me for harvesting the field\nOf the French part what is the third language I speak a little bit of Spanish those Spanish so so the ... been with the hot clubs and it's like two thousand and nine and ... this is an amazing form of music not necessarily lending nuts\nFor the French part what is the third language I\nSpeak a little bit of Spanish most Spanish\nSo so ... you've been with the hot clubs and it's like two thousand nine and ... this is an amazing form of music not necessarily lending itself to Vogel so how do you how do you how do you get to interpret this as a as an artist too that\nYou are brilliant or about to find out how brilliant you are but but lending the human voice to music like this not an easy thing to\nDo well and during that she had to think of myself as as a part of the band you know I'm just not the vocalists to the band and you\nKnow so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know\nWell we're about to find out Nepal or a week you [laughter]\nThat you are you did it when you were in Paris\nRight he went on to what you did your soda and you did the busking thing you'll be played on on the streets and that's something that a Django did as well he had in his early years is so so I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing in the streets of Paris kind of a romantic founding yeah I\nI Am kind of a hopeless romantic but what was really funny about it I had a birthday on and I'm a lot of people took my picture and then they would come up to me and say excuse anymore\n... blue photograph she's it okay and I would do my best French impersonation ago [noise] [noise]\nI made so much money can be real thing that I was French Boeing and it was great it was the beginning of you know you're you're saying the key to speaking French is to sound annoyed\nThat how that works for you if you saw the movie sweet and loaded on there was a character and actually the ... and that was the one I don't want I don't want French folks listening to us on American forces ready to be able to the beautiful language survivor Leo\nAnd and and Isabelle you are growing up in France where you familiar with the music of Django when as a young\nGirl not so much actually I came to Django after learning about jazz which is kinda weird that um [noise]\nYeah I was growing up in France and listening to French radio and there wasn't much Django Reinhardt on the French id and at the time and he really\nHad his second term to feign a and the year two thousand where a a French pop art is sort of an hurts and and hurt yet what is the what I mean and ah and brought it back to the public actually well\nIn recent the last Twenty years a lot of his music has been used in motion pictures which is another way of of introducing his his music to the to the public but I don't think his back story is really well known Paul I mean the whole idea of the other being so severely\nHandicapped and us being in yet being almost superhuman on a front board right I mean that that that is as as brilliant a part of his his or as the music itself\nYeah superhuman that's it that's all you need to know that's\nThat's all we're going to talk about [laughter] that's fine so we're going to get back to Isabella here you have a wonderful CD coal live at your she's where a lot of this music is found and you're going to do to an appropriately enough that you can sing called I loved Paris yeah hot club or San Francisco on the woods\n\nHis his aura as the music itself yeah superhuman that's it that's all you need to know\nThat that's all we are going to talk about okay that's fine so we're going to get back to Isabella here you have a
