amazing would songs kid\nFirst up there we're going to dip into some genuine American music history\nAs based here in Kentucky it's the sounds of jug band jug band started at the turn of the century became very popular around Louisville, Kentucky and continues but you have heard the sound in popular music\nIt started in the Nineteen sixties with the sound of a great group called a loving spoonful John Sebastian and his drug ban one\nDay for day during\nThey dream in Britain long ago\nJerry had a huge hit with the judge downtown\nGreat music great sound coming from\nA historic there's music [noise]\nThese guys carry on that tradition were very very proud that they could be here we're going to talk to them about jug band music and what it means to Americana and American music they're going to do a tune from a brand new album is called jugs up this is called a washed board man please welcome from Louisville, Kentucky the juggernaut jug band on the Woodstock\n\n\n\nPlay ball with their lives on his hands grains around the time and often avenues saying I Love to hear that man [noise]\n\n\n\nHappy and everything is going to do the random oh man\nHappy and everything is the last man\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWell he'll tell you change\nMan usually make you feel just fine\nLives do the ...\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplished you superseded all the expectations in you became a big success as far\nSo you're driving\nIs supposed to talk about the the Allen Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah and it's sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist technically put a hold on on a song\nThat came to Ellen Jackson's attention tell him tell\nMe how that happened that was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan herd it out of a publisher at the time who played for Allen's producer and he put it on hold on for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on\nSo he was out to lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you to get back to the office in\nAllen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen I was a song Monday morning church was a beautiful beautiful\n[noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and waiting and you it was killing\n'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nAnd would tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nAnd actually a dairy Overton Eddie amount of kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he cannot stand by me and to hear that cut and you know it's a really it's a strange thing it's almost like\nYou're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran ears song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if you've seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that I'm driving down music row and heard it and\nWe were actually on music growing here yeah wow the talk of the serendipity those stores were lining up for you that\nAnother claim to fame that you had and this kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been an interesting uh fill it down through probably singing and working all the time really helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs nice guy\n[laughter] so what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music and the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music grow has really changed it's interesting\nAh you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast um\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have a radio when she was born and are want all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before\nYou you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also\nYou have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I\nI really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know ... when I was trying to write I just tried to write something\nI Love that I'm kind of fell into it\nSo now you have ah you you have the series of of a single vote you sort of releasing on your own one of the time told me about that don't tell me what you're doing there\nBut I put out an album last fall called with the town crier that I'm really proud of Jimmy Johnson a gym is brown ... already said that say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that has got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine\nA critic came in saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs was just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more to stick base songs or just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh she wasn't fresh baked cookies out their share with your audience will\nAllen Jackson even sit in one of the songs lordy don't the wheels turn slow and hey that's a that it is true and it takes a lot of uh there's a lot of work being patient\nThrough the through the process but speaking of whiskey town cry which is a great great title because that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yes back in the ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming the in the news or or the state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a theme to record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters in story song so each one of these songs could be\nA little a article\nIn the local paper a lot of places that we can recommend living things like that it's like well a\nHeartache cells pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey town cry or you're going to dip into that album for this particular song is called ... just like a cowboys Aaron
