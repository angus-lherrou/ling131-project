New York [noise]\nHis brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that\nIt was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter]\nUm that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists did he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing at the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes Adam\nContinues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes to add on on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise] [laughter]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] no that's a that's a kind of hazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say\nIf he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to fund for sites that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something they never sent you right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but\nI don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much ... every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nI was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your\nPetty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself when you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio peace\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying it the New York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine and then\nTo edit the quotes that she had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show have ... we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like a story on our show\nIs history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nTypes university it's a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of

about how Jayanti was magnificent and uh [noise] like I say right after that I might have gotten back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh [noise] I guess that really struck a chord had heard that was pretty amazing\n\nThey bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good or you know start making a lot of [laughter] a peculiar pap [noise]\n\nTalked about the idea one night in
