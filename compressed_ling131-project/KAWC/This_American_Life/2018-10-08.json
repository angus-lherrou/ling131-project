this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nFrom to me this one feels the worst oh I think because the original hearing itself a duck to forward and judge Kavanaugh\nTestimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong that even watching it with emotional it was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief\nRepublican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first\nAct [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake [noise] second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable at all [noise] let me be the Chicago this American Life America stay with us\n\nOne judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see a tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided than seemed like a no when Kavanaugh was yes it was like wait a week ... made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time and Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nHere and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator [noise]\nHe just sent me up for an interview\nJust late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside and it's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right path to a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nWhat they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberate\nTune in this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right path to a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the boat\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nFlick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination then he was confronted by a mob of screening protesters and the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and reading things like the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the euro to convince fleet read over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest\nWorks so much of these last two weeks and then people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him shake his head no when asked about it by other reporters\nThis morning that they have\nAlso we talked about it\nWas the ... and there was a\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers and for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat do you live in one way and therefore when you think you can replace what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nGlad we're having this er into that [noise]\n... making fun of themselves we talked about this before with lots of mended age she doesn't connect you well to emotion\n[noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a daily basis undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he'd spoken hearing you sounded just as I'm sure as he had going in and it was it\nBefore you explain what happened next I wanted to say going into a day like this undecided\nIs both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize civilian we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certain to go out of this room today and and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happened at the end with Jeff Flake and let you know what happens here\nThan eight after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't as off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nOr any decision on a vote that's been that's just\nThe debates staff discussions late last night too and\nHour yeah every politician does that mean\nWe like politicians we we feed on it\nAdmitted it\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted after seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP\nOn Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday week announced his decision he's a yes on Kavanaugh I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt looked Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff is a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said we're not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging he would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes you said why'd you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied\nTell me about his

vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned in a cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today jak potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has\nThat changed since you went through\nWell I like my own\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political party and they have to act in the political away\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSouthern southern southern so the Senate and a lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people

four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realize one of us will have\nTo write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAn opinion that explains\nThat teaches the principles of war the principles of the constitution or the controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case [noise] ah we draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust that the public has been our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nThat trust\nBy it here in to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd courtesy and scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nI have one more story I don't know if this

today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nI felt guilty he told a reporter and sad\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope the talking about the

here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone\nTo choose life imprisonment when in fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison
