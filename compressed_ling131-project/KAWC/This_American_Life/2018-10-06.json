our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing that was when we had it\nAnd I bet you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the members we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions from\nTo me this one feels the worst oh I think ... or because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nHas the money was just so wow like it was so many hours on main road witnesses were so emotionally wrong what that even watching it with emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week kind of waiting for the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state agitation and disbelief Republican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one [noise]\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean like they have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall\nWe have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake [noise] center second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nOn a man's life or death no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable at all [noise] let me be the Chicago it's this American Life I married by a with a\nOne\nJudge [noise] to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see a tortured face he dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over\nHe was undecided than seem like it now on Kavanaugh there was a yes that was like wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill is with him in the days before and after the cabin out here in watching what is going through and talking to him about how he made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story how Jeff Flake changed his mind\nHe was undecided than seem like a no and Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake committed the Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a guest again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator and here to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed it to my [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nDashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and\nCrumbled ... was one of the two women and that confrontation as senator play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to where the Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days [noise] lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protests works so much of these last two\nWeeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nHere this morning that they have also\nWe talked about it was ... and there was a it was a thing\nIt's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nSupport what do you believe in one way and therefore we believe women have the same manner saying what do you have to say please [noise] something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nJust the day before Lincoln I got in an elevator on the other side of the building cities in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily found\nSupport what do you know one way and therefore we believe when you think what do you have to say please [noise] something you can say the winning right now in the survivors clever having this year and\nYou and people like that\nSleek making fun of himself who talked about this before with lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge cabinet I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that area and we are Twenty one very imperfect senators\nTrying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happened at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't off putting to him as I thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat and that's been let's just\nHad a debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nWe like politicians we we feed on a\nAdmitted in a\nAnd then it happened it's just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP\nOn Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday week announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nYou know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report\nGood method [noise]\nAnd then it happened it's just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP\nOn Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday week announced a decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we're viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho thought the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads the said it was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report [noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating\nYou but you're kind of back among among your people\nThat people had stuff all barely chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in a kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nVery chase from the studios of our program but you're not it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course as the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years does him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today chopped us a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since he went through\nWell I like my own uh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act in a political way\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nYou how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\nWhat\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nOf the character and the learning\nThe church should be broadly read\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd the integrity of our court\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe character and the learning\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get a for an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSo so so the so the Senate and a lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience cutting high school students people asking ... cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way it is funny he's a big talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case it's a one in which there is a great issues of public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five for Cape and it's not just reverse from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get\nMSA at five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high five of them thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all as\nWe realized one of us will have to write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAn opinion that explains\nIt teaches the principles of war the principles of the constitution or the controls the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case [noise] uh we draw down on a capital of trust and we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish [noise]\nBy hearing to our judicial owes by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n... I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or\nThe Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this I was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both it was it nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes ago I said well do you have any questions\nAnd are want attorneys raises Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah howdy\nThis tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's we're both it was at nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raises Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nOr if they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera cases [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the ... they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty out here to some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raises fan is all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it wants to expect it to six back\nI thought I think I remember your lap when it was a three six pack\nThanks to perform club with the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up a total and complete amateur has to decide the death sentence was only previous experience in these matters\nWatching law and order that's in a minute Chicago public radio when our program continues\nBrett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation fight has exposed and invited the Senate and the nation in conflict\n[noise] it's like we have turned against each other brother against religious are going to\nTrack how the Senate votes lineup hand will talk to radio calling hosts from around the country to find out what their listeners are telling them about the court drama that next time on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nAll things considered heirs of this afternoon at five on key WC eighty eight point nine FM and K.

here he took the call outside behind his office building\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in fact\nAll I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cats [noise] so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nNow would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened I think fans never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness sheer driven may and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nThan was never able to write

[noise]\n\nA few months after spending need Maryland's email and execution date was that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against

been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nDo I do I need to apologize for not\nNot during one should

remain and our until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of ... Berger about a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Maryland right and\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nChills or forward to her original email just fed once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first
