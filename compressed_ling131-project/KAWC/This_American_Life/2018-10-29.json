high school diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli that is American Adam grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York [noise]\nHis brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that\nIt was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe deep thoughts of a young Zionists did he prepared its way to lead his nation [noise]\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary ... remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch that will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [laughter]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's a kind of ... and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\nOr a fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I understand your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to run through a site that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something [laughter] end up seeing it you're right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become design at [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life\nThan that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation may may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with ... with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... um\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would\nFeel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio ...\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nLike I settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drawing it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you've gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from the American life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nDid a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity it's a pretty extreme place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad\nAnd [noise] I guess basically got up on a on someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was a magnificent and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten a phone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\nI\nBought a lot about it um [noise] at actually good or you know for me thinking along a particular path\n\nTalked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over campus that in both pretty\nHigh in nine feet tall continue giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the giants were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the cloud at the time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man of blooming boy\nI don't even know exactly it was something like you know I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kinda weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nAdjusting [laughter] way though I don't know and\nGot to college friend who does access giant man's leg\n...
