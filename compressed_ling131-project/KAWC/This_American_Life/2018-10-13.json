around sixty two\n\nAt the school trying to do the right thing let's go try something new tried to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building\nAnd a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\n[noise] the\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids are out to destroy them or Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team are we to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team as soon as the pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explaining how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe they've been installed in locations all but the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this sort of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nSo they fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into this if you had to put your finger on the sensor has like a hundred\nAnd it's all for taking\nI don't know if there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade sixth through twelve\nHe's running from his office dark side the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware of the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings in other cases ...\nEnough of this way\nMary wearing a helmet every wing\n[noise]\nBut if you feel you're winning the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's why this happens automatically motorcycle doesn't to lock down the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\n... you're trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nReal high here we go by Oregon [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nThis happens automatically when the focus into lockdown that he and the two guys with him are stuck ... keys and he's trying to find the right one\n... you're trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right that\nSounds that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything it just timing or is that\nWhen great that\nWas an attorney you compare to the first time yeah oh yeah it was it was a guy here in the doors\nAre\nClay said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to the school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force and so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and so\nI wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have done that's pretty scary it's scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this as a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss\nI Can't miss [noise] because if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting hurt\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student at my school\nOf course he might have to be one of his students and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAnd\nThey shouldn't do just continue to happen\nToday and I've heard them we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or tried to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nStill not enough\nTo do to prepare\nLike staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others will get previous shooting\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can still not enough to have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help from WBEZ in Chicago it's this American Life America ... the what the\n\n\nHeck one ready as you'll never be pretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there is an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation has come after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than anywhere I say I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do and\nEven still even with that and he still has\nPatch and the people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through the training\nThey did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies\nBomb threat hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's the teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard thank and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the old school did that's over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and goes through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every ... black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid might have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kid [noise] knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced drug blanks but age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were surprised active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she glance to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face the freshman building\nOf kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running\nThat they were anticipating what months on Ashley were surprised active shooter trail using blanks bird\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of the freshman building\nI see like hundreds\nOf kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that\nAnd it's they they're not [noise] there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nYou know it was real [noise]\n\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me under screaming at them keep running to stop\nYou got it back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was in ... there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave them leave and be like that and\n... actually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct and for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n...\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group is small enough to fitness applied closets amongst the told them to leave their backpack that insight she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot\nAnd dark except students face it slip by their cell phones and once I had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department because we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the first rebuilding she tax she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend fair and says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been greeted by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nAnd our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on\nAnd when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement and around and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of\nAn hour went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on\nAnd when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have said this is a police anyone in here and then there was a kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nFit in power that and training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to get about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know it's got below the closest door and grabbed the handle with two hands in polls closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grades she survived [noise] got Beagle in the room next to this day the used at the same things they seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting ... of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have vending that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having\nA playbook for what to do helped and now I lock my door now I count the kids in my classroom now I Move us all to a closet but they also both had ideas coming out of the ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what's effective and these drugs at ... university and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U.S the train school how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't on\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ...\nActive shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation at the time [noise]\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like he'd bring over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat ... shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that that data\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym as a last resort he fighting basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually cars how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student from ever it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had\nDone it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull their kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nDaughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nI asked her what the drill it's four she said oh I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced\nAnd how and investigator on that cage told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nLet it go ... go crazy are hard\nTo [noise] [laughter]\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're ... ...\nTo ... honey you're doing it now\nOkay\n[laughter] let it go ... go to cry your heart\nIs [noise] [laughter]\nMm oh God I'm so sorry we're there was a good mood\nToday yes okay honey you're doing it now\n[noise] okay ...\nHis name is can present ski he graduated last year there are crosses set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins who he really loved he said she always trying to be strict with him we can never keep coming up front for very long\nChance breeze taken a deep breath [laughter] he can nice see\n\nAfter a few minutes he's called for us enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop so he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears\nAnd start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the answer is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs or would not get a share of the district oyster drug stores are so able to do\nAnd no he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later that year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for\nGrieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement a conspiracy theorists to believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones at our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse the famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips is ran into him face to face at a gun control of that he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stuffed and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere's truth or ... or ... trolls families of victims on social media\nImmediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after the Philips it's on gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail the hope there are one of the things the Philips has formed parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she\nThe things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm mhm\n[noise] after watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started just you'd find called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting [laughter] like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I Will go because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventeen people were\nInjured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yes because they wish they had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if the parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nI said that's what we look like five months ago\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filtered side there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson the parents

... kids suddenly environmentally and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo filter now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that huge kids go to to raise money to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nIt wants you to move on what you really want you to get back to normal light mon brothers should they should know Seamus you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not the same person I never will be the shooters were obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWas that support looks like overtime and what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son and the shooting in Parkland on a ... I met them at their house or something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on us when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for Supreme drops which said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting mission aka got phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck with okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police\nOfficer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description [noise] but by that evening the door it's still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped and think his name calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and I should say [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the air's screams from these terms than their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like the we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that she was harassed\nAnd have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nLike the we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that he was arrested and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "13"}
