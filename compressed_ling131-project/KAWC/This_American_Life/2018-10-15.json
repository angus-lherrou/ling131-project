solitude for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team recently with pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm Wondering how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations all but the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe you had to put your finger on the center of\nAnd a little tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John ... is the principal for grade six to twelve\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one of these shootings and other kid can kill nothing nothing this way [noise]\nElementary and wondering if in the elementary when\n[noise]\nUnless you're willing to building also has middle school and high school right so the principal running down the hallway\nAnd it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically wonderful goes into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and you're trying to find the right one\nDriving he's trying to unlock the door\nHere we go [noise]\n\nReal here we'll\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they\nFind the shooter right there\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great that wasn't attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force and so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were fifty\nPrincipal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's ... guy didn't grow up with guns had never used

don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here or Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and and so\nI wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time he should've gone that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility or somebody else getting hurt\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nGet an effort that we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it'll pass despite the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and\nThoreau as they possibly can and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America ... stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] oh\nHeck one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nCame after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than where I knew what to me\nEven sell even with that\nThat might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers

one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than the workday I mean they knew what to do me what to do\nEven still even with that we feel bad\nHas the people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through the training\nThey did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warning a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every one this is what a code black it this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid might have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and not silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nTraining expecting an unannounced drug with blanks knows that age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were surprised active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she went to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\n\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nYou shot it back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were ...\nHe shot back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened there were terrified people running and I just I could not in all conscious as leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise] ...\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct and for some teachers that wasn't a choice that um [noise]\n... ... ... ... ... ...\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nAnd she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway ... group a small enough to fitness applied call that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot\nAnd dark except students face it slip by their cell phones and months I had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she tax she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter\nThere was a shooter and my floor um and so my my friend fair and says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told her she had been grade by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police evidence that this is the police then you went in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to get about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\nNot\nOnce told me that actually was one of five people you know who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to be\nAn even did that on the third floor when they\nFor the shooter and I know they have their weapons drawn she really just had to get about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\nYou know\nWhat they're told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that in the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls they closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacey it's the teacher who are most grades she survived got Beagle and the room next that they see it at the same things stay seated waited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shooting for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of the ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teacher training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research it's what's effective and these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meaning\nThe consumed by talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using code\nAt all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to locate code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits\nLike a cafeteria gym\nFor the last resort you fight basically trust your ability\nTo make a decision [noise]\nAnd told her about actually occurs how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student\nThe idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to actually carry how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] however that\nBreak from school for the call Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably and in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at that lets a barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids in her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nI asked her what the drill it's four she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one o'clock German students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that cage told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drilled in school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWho don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're we're ... ...\nYeah to kill you honey you're doing it now okay\nHis name is John present ski he graduated last year there crosses set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved he said she would try to be strict with him looking ever keep coming up front for very long\nChance breeze taken a deep breath he can nice the rat\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of breath enough to talk\nHe tells Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop so he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears\nAnd start pulling out of the feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know these are the violence is going on in the world goes away as ... to go to a strip orange or drugs or or so able to get in\nBreathe with me [laughter]\nAfter a few minutes he's called for us enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting and stuff so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then tried suddenly switches gears\nAnd start pulling out of the feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the evidence is going on in the world goes ... because the strip orange or drug stores are still able to do\nAnd now he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year olds who they're actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a second and I know but they're also advocate for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around\nGuns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse the famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face at a gun control of that and he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nThere is truth ... troll families of victims on social media\nImmediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after the Philip that's on gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the demand he was writing him ended up in jail hoax or one of the things that Philips informed parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nI'm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Japanese prime called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just [noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went why isn't it\nShooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong\nHe said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch re holder\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were\nInjured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts that\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings at that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nSandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filled suicide there was also a strong an instance of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson the parents about kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that huge kids go to to raise money to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nIt won't you to move on what you want you to get back to normal my own brother should face should through no shame as you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear which makes\nWe want you to get back to normal might mon rather should they should [laughter] you're not sure he was you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not the same person I never will be the shooters were obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that\nWhen Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a kitten that store at I met them at their house or something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland when teen who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis on his win scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached the point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been\nMoved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nFor the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find your son as just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time\nAnd the airstrikes claims from nature and then their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\nThe we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that the terrorists and have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare", "year": "2018", "show_name":
