God well visiting the shouted conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not\nCriticized the Saudis and beer down gun Jay was what the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr showed jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled\nThe pressure was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people you know a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called ... unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment worth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts are facts are as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer ally in Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with\nThe Saudis now all of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the a C is hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in ...\nSure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now called Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob\nAnd I can tell you the rally crowds love that language or any talks about that that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border\nAnd lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nI demographic three you know that would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us that you've got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death in your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to ... he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us\nGlad to be here based on all of your experience there's the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nOf how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which\nBy the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how\nCitizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in in\nThe rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps them talking\nAbout the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior and top two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank

through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives

president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and another Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political casual\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the care of and has been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing

Arabia's offered an explanation for his death\nIt's only a first step president wants to gather more information before deciding how to respond to members of Congress have called for sanctions on the Saudis so far the administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince ... reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite a bit about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or have to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things had a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom has pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... men lucid motors Saudi money also\nThe kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like uber than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis

with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museum they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War of the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former

of their ... basket and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged the show ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\nSay there's been a great ...\nSays this is so\nSad but Bronson says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On the show the represented for many of us flies this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient and he he expected to be patient and when he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with behind in some on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president stresses he

under these circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormously classifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't yeah [noise] yeah so\nWe knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average and the child with getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents tell you\n[noise] so the parents saying to us why ... we're well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so there was this need that wish from the parents and the ... who was the diner\nThat she could be a diner and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request

have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program\n... says I'm from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program\nHIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life then that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nStarting at seven PM and Mary Elizabeth

John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to shrug gee\nWe turn now to evoke the older he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us a lot to be based on all of your experience just the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham gee died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick\nSecretary of state or a bump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nOr how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh than how much in Washington because it seems to me like\nBoth Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWell at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis the end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have\nIf we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a but it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen the top two weeks\nIs unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nInstead of your breath because we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit one ad shows that happy half dozen people voting downstream in an empty livestock tank that's apparently I never asked a cruise ship with the headline\nIs it one ad shows a happy half dozen people floating downstream in an empty livestock tank that's apparently\nA Nebraska cruise ship but the headline lucky for you there's nothing to do here John directs the stage tourism director says their ad campaign had to strike a different note because not a lot of people say they think visiting Nebraska he says I called

addiction can be just about any fish in a ritual that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of the smiling face of metal to blend in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but you're suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs to near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kate O'Neal Rosie ... and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musical and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWhat happened we had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she can\nOxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I go there to ... yeah she tried many what made you sure all of this and you're a bridge or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived\nAnd said to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing\nSource of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday ... rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left me\nDoug indeed fun\nNow a gate\nO'Neill wrote about her sister Maddy mention there tend to Vermont we'd be seven days thank you so much for being who you want to thank you so much for having\nMe\nIf you know\nI Know and I know [noise] [noise]\nOh what\nHow long Franklin is post forty or an English exiled who's got a pretty humdrum time for Twenty years or so she's been in the cosmopolitan city of Prague she translate sparkling pros what the instructions for washing machines\nSarah Perry rush in her new novel melanoma Helen has an Arab sadness who shore she cannot get shot [noise] Carol scholar friend gives hell in a pile of checks histories diaries letters footnotes\nAnd she begins to find them those pages the outlines of a woman reaches across ... from seventeenth century England the Germany the Nineteen forties a modern day manila to witness it absorbs the horror of the forgotten and forlorn ...\n... author of the international best show her the structure but towards us now from New York Thanks so much for being with us thank you for having me sketch moments in force could you please\n[noise] so the premise of the novel is that it's very lonely women begins to hear that there is a ... so called Mel most the witness", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Yuma", "day": "20"}
