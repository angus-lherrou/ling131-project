bit and he did but just before\nA rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it\nAnd I'd have a much different John frankly the press was\nEven handed the press was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there is what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh a posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted with out\nThe shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is the president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away will live and to this past week affect the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case his ... is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story would turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how does one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source that uh he apparently was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a and a political anger starts coming out in in social media wants thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the north\nSouthern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in ... in the community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of in northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale and say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza\nWill say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nThat's like hello hey last Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much\nThank you lose the leading up to them it turns this election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the big governors' races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the too big a house and Senate\nWill do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor and medical not to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats and the senator up as the constitution required Democrats are facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red or states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending ... seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd are more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of that cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape and twenty Eighteen where they could go on off as\nThe best target for Democrats is in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nHis Jewish a lot of big ideas if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry

C. dot org and from Americans for the arts\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm little Garcia Navarro in these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers rate for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly\nIn our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago but why voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then sent when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very Larry clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voted on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it\nIt's it's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair\nIs it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for
