Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nUm what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're saying that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and some people say it wasn't a\nI Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically to get the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph\nAnd she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without the thing that I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provide\nSo they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without the thing that I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian Bussey Ford a sincere uh but that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews they're Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent um but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh is gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with\nFord has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you turn to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor of Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump use a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump passed on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so in a way that allow them to avoid\nStory or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid or around fifty million or so\nAnd when when Donald represent over the years I've built would I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise]

I can learn about you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that it's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers do\nOur fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had he kind of pattern because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so he\nKind of the early I Believe an opioid addiction\nShe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nHis old camp though this is old your opinion with me underscore\nThat do of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a state wide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell it it it sounds as if you have accepted

Employment Opportunity commission have gone up twelve percent\nThat's after years of remaining steady the EOC is the government agency that handles workplace discrimination cases including sexual harassment\nThe vast majority of those claims do not go to litigation but even the number that do it doubled this year the EEO sees acting chair Victoria ... says the interest generated by me to has been enormous\nWe've had a five fold increase of hits to our website of people looking for information about sexual harassment we've done hundreds of training sessions for employers\nHere's something else that has changed as a result of me too there's a real money available for women to get help says Sharon to Johnny\nI've been a civil rights lawyer and women's rights lawyer for the last Twenty

for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time that some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect into lawyers and the lawyers help them when they can but sometimes there isn't something that can be done\nYou got a plow the ground and plant the seeds before you can read to harvest\nJoe Freeman has written books on

battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be haven't seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox and relief pitching really almost gave it up there at Yankees had chances in the sixth inning bases loaded bases lives

pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and they gave me the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred but they went under and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line up to the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem

National League champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the

named to Bush and out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members are alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been growing for some of the court for years and swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially is they're going to be um more prominent than ever and us live\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of the few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now

allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome entry enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported or the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nI'm wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's all\nI mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a\nI Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length and you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those ... should\nPeople basically to his of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not with Kevin ... name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took but she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph\nAnd she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to rent\nIt's crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you turn to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations Distomo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters\nAre a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nPassed on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nAnd when when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built that I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize just distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an exam\nThe building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests\nThat that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used\nTo inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their armada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay\nStay tuned for wait wait don't tell me coming up and twenty minutes you're on K.
