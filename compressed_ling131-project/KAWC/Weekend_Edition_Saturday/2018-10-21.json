Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n[noise] ... [noise]\nAnd a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his productions of a red wave a what do you think state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates\nDon't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that Michigan in Wisconsin or two states that are really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are huge\nIn the state that didn't as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of uh uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the\nTaxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the uh the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big wave for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers somebody's governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the

edition from NPR News under the guise of ten of our President Trump says he's planning to pull out of an international arms control agreement as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports it's a treaty signed by President Reagan design to reduce the dangers of nuclear war\nThe idea of apocalyptic nuclear war isn't something people think about these days but back in the Nineteen eighties it was a real concern the U.S and Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at each other and they were building [noise]\nNot decide\nTo Nineteen eighty three filmed the day after dramatized out things might and a massive nuclear attack killing millions president Ronald Reagan with no ... but he wanted to eliminate the danger of nuclear weapons posed as a first step he and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev negotiated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nOnce implemented it would bring about the elimination of an entire class of American Soviet nuclear missiles\nThe treaty band missiles that both sides have deployed around Europe missiles that could have quickly started a dangerous nuclear war the IMF treaty has remained enforce ever since but in recent years Russia has started work on new missiles that America Says violate the treaty yesterday President Trump said he'd had\nEnough we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement I go out as the weapons were not allowed to wear the one we bought it for Russia is not very much germinate they were going to pull out\nThe Trump Administration is expected to notify the Russian said the decision this week arms control experts say the move is a rash won the U.S doesn't needed some missiles at this time they say and the withdrawal believe just one final nuclear arms control treaty employees Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington\nVoters are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with both major political parties nearly Seventy percent of Americans say that the two parties fail to adequately represent the American people according to a recent nonpartisan survey a Colorado based group called unite America is trying to use that dissatisfaction to elect more independent candidates to office nationwide\nFrom Colorado Public radio bend to Brooklyn reports\nYou make America wants to galvanize voters like Anthony cross he's a Democrat but says he'd absolutely backing unaffiliated candidate if he agreed with their policy\nPosition if anything the last presidential election has proven that\nBoth parties in many ways a flaw or leadership and those parties are\nStill thinks the chance that he would ultimately vote for someone who was an affiliated is pretty slim\nBecause there's a high likelihood that I might not even know that that person exists [noise]\nThat's the thing is that you don't know how can you vote for that and how are you getting messages\nThat square unite America is trying to fill a void they've helped a handful of Colorado State house candidates qualify for the ballot campaign and get their names out with promotional videos there endorsing twenty four unaffiliated candidates running for all levels of office from across\nThe country recently held in\nIn twenty four unaffiliated candidates running for all levels of office from across\nThe country to group recently held a national summit for candidates in Denver whole Jones is running against an incumbent Democrat competitive Colorado State house district he believes his independent mindset will resonate with voters who are frustrated and\nLooking for change everybody wants to put you in a box they want you to stand in a box or they can clearly defined what are you are but that's the problem faces they were trying to solve complicated issue with very black and white college in states\nLike Colorado unaffiliated voters now outnumber both Republicans and Democrats but many of those unaffiliated voters actually consistently vote was one party or the other\nIt's been more than a hundred years since Colorado elected and unaffiliated candidate to the legislature Nick ... is the executive director of unite America\nHe believes the purple state like Colorado with a narrowly divided legislature is the perfect place to launch this movement\nShould just two or three or four independents could have a transformative impact if no party had an outright majority that catches ram their agenda through they would need to reach across the aisle for some votes\nBut if that's the goal unite America isn't fielding candidates in the right racist to full control of either of Colorado's chambers\nRegardless of whether or not their candidates win any races in Colorado or across the country Dick Wadhams the former head of the state Republican Party says they could be spoilers he thinks their message is especially attracted to younger voters who tend to be more liberal but don't necessarily identify with the party\nIf some democratic candidates and when it's on competitive seats they might be responsible for some Democrats will say\nOne question about the group is how much it's donors are spending a top democratic election attorney has filed a campaign finance complaint against unite America it's successful it could force the group to reveal more about its donors and spending for NPR News I'm Ben to Parkland\nAhead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and

asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use our justice for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over your er during the day we can bring identity then when they don't do much good\nAt all so I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why do people have different from each other so that the idea that you fix a lot by\nAnd they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other so that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should on to your question directly gingerly

and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy parents are ... or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty to the kingdom or is there any opposition and the region\nAnd government are certainly a credit to a display their loyalty at many than issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and ah I think so and of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot a\nLot of fear a lot of worry that got people who are activists journalists dissident [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatening now\nThis journalists dissidents um and those who may be speaking their opinion on may in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information\nIt's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are\nAre journalists as well and activists and others so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region what they've been able to play this role of of basically defending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange any of them that's meant that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was best known among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City poor demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of ...\nAlthough the remains of never been found their deaths were very deeply blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis in the shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\n... visa official version they Mexican Government said that they I mean ... they didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two oh gee I Wish austerity everything and ... what I have seen them\nWhat was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything and species official story what I have seen all these years four years of investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true its ally [noise]\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the student and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where
