Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so Ken Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum when sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss ups but then it didn't seem real chances to flip some places are in really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by Pfizer for education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists\nKobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont still Scott are all favorites to win re election\nThey could flip to seed in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you [noise]\nAbolish

Navarro\nUtility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common than\nWe thought we were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to solve a downfall and wires and restored their electricity [noise] say county emergency services chief mark\nBowe and says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and the editor and electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities we are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and to restore power\nBut actually a full rebuild in some cases after big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the element\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground in is not a silver bowl\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that they'd accept a twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground\nBut fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line if I Know that it can actually be much more cost me and take very long time after time to act and an overhead wire\nMcNamara says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure\nShe says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient one thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and battery that places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be ... chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population and keep the lights on even if the broader powers that\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida as a big potential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season markets ... covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nLike driving me All right so first off you grow up in Key West and Key West injured or much it's over a year ago you see a lotta storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of wave in Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd then all of the associated\nDestructive ... that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman um who also has a lot of support and pockets of of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a\nA benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the stage he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk I was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes so she's been\nHurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo she has been kind of all over ah both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a C leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of been the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mayor\nBut it was pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ... ... wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the ... the county Leon county which is where ... space shuttle had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit she was being attacked Andrew Gillum buys aren't run the scientist for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually changed showing trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so she's changed your trees [laughter] well he's making sure\nGillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone trying to capitalize on the on the media moment and and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be ... that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again

Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down he\nJessica Hi Lila so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors they haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting\nWill effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten\nThey controlled redistricting and very important states who they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races some couples pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum when sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa it's going to be I think a really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss up but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nAdmit that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip the seed in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you oh\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in their jails for the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats from member station WNYC reports\nAnd hoping county New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned into a political firestorm\nThe issue of the deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement agency pays the ... the housing immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the

County jail or ice detainees\nActivists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz says the county's shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn you night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one better but if we can get it\nSo they got down here and I think how we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten towers Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board of ... as the county legislators in New Jersey are known assured residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this\nSo it's not just rhetoric across the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAnd in Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job then I found\nYou've on balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents the immigrants at
