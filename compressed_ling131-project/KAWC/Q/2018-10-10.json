at the bookstore or at a library pick it up off the shelf ...

stepfather\nSally Field gets incredibly honest about how that trauma resulted in deep seated anxiety that followed her right through her massive Hollywood career so I can imagine putting this together was a process for Sally Field it took about seven years top to bottom to put this memoir together\nBut as you're about to hear Oscars aside\nIt ended up being one of her biggest achievements\n[noise] so I feel welcome to thank you how are you doing I'm good how are you I I'm very well I have so much to talk to you about go ahead I mean some of the stuff is not so easy to talk to you about but I have to say of all the book interviews I've done I rarely start with this question in fact I Can't even think of when you're a sad when\nYou started the books called in peace and I would have barely start with the title is what I mean\nIt seems like when you read the book to your life is truly\nDifferent pieces of your life there's a little bit about the title [noise] when my mother\nPassed away on my sixty fifth birthday seven years ago\nUm I thought I had done all the right things you know I've had those confrontations that we we had um ... resolved anything left that needed to be resolved I thought\nAnd yet it was so deeply disquiet at like say was something urgent thing something fast during on me and I couldn't find out what the wound was\n[noise] and I I I I felt I had to dig in\nMind all the pieces of my life\nAnd put them out in front of me\nAnd put them together piece them together to see what picture it was that I was missing that if I couldn't do that than I Would never be able to move on I Would always still this deeply just quieted I'm\nAnd they're also taught that this bad behavior is cool is great it makes you more of a man and makes you more um sexy any of that\nAnd that has to be done\nAnd not to mention to deny deny deny if you were ever accused of anything it seems like the current narrative of to to not and I find it hard to not as much as you possibly can never take ownership or accountability for any of your actions [noise]\nThat well that's yes um especially those who are who are caught in the spotlight of all of this and have never realized in their lives that that you know that they are part and parcel of this at their behavior has been not\nIdeal um but within the confines of when they grow up and how they grew up they were acting like everybody else they could say\nGenerally it's an interesting time to be having this conversation beyond the book\nYou talk about a director asks you to kiss him before I'll give you a part in the film he comes out and says that's completely on true I mean a lot of the current moment is about survivors of come forward stories like you and and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how how does it feel to write such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back and you're like that\nAnd and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how is it how does it feel to write such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back and you're like that\n[noise] um\n... you know I don't think about that I I certainly think about Dr Ford and how the kind of ... of greed just it was yesterday I couldn't even watch yesterday and President Trump apologized\nUm you know to the ... you know on behalf of the country um for justice Kavanaugh's ill treatment\nAnd that's a great just as far as I'm concerned agree ages and um [noise] I you know it's it really is you can be outraged and you can be you know incensed and or any of those but that doesn't get anything\nDone ultimately that has to be on something on the other side of this and certainly I I personally could not thank Dr Ford more as a human being as a woman I think are deeply deeply and profoundly and we have to keep going\nI Can't imagine what it's like to to say something that's so hard to say and then have it be doubted\nYeah ... ... you know I I was raised in the forties was born in the forties raised in the fifties came of age in the sixties\nYou know ... it's hard to think that people would take you seriously I mean it's ... that's the hard part so you know overlooking that or finding a way to navigate through that is one second nature to me ah because that's all there was\nSo um I don't I Can't pause\nA and feel what it feels like to be um you know treated with such great disregard and how you're not believed in your trivialize that you can't ... it it it takes too much time to stop and feel it you have to just keep piling on\nThis is a really powerful book and I I Want to thank you for coming in I I started the interview I asked me about the title which I said it's like I've never seen before I'm going to end it was something I've never done before either I'm gonna ask you about the cover recover an appointed several people listening on the radio so the front\nWe had a big part of a discussion in the office about our interpretations

Bush does she seem tentative and on the back is I Would see you now you're you're laughing you're you're joyful you seem genuinely happy is is that in ... there's something to be taken from those two images\nWell I think it's the fade out fate in if if if nothing else just in age wise you know a lot of um I'm twenty seven and I'm Wondering about the one in the back I'm like ... you know probably close to Seventy sixty eight or something ah\nAnd if nothing else it's just about longevity like us\nBut do you see your to do is I feel like the same person do you\nAs the one in the front and back mhm no\nNo I mean it is the same person I feel very much the same ingredients but um I I have the ... of history holding up my legs so different than I had on the cover girl\nAnd do you think that writing it all out like you did reliving these moments of giving it an additional thirty minutes\nYes no question yeah absolutely\nDon't tell me more about that I Would have had that how do you feel that\nWell I didn't for so long I I was uh when I was just finishing his book last year um\nHow do you feel that\nWell I didn't for so long I I was uh when I was just finishing his book last year um

yeah I don't know what I'm doing and why I what am I learned\nAnd and Sam said my God mother stop stop and think from one minute\nDon't you see how different you are today than you or seven years ago how differently you see yourself\nAnd I went oh oh\nYes yes\nAnd he was right and it took me a moment to really through gather it all up to realize that I I in that seven year period was able to incorporate\nFeel though the reality of my own history of my accomplishments I've always before that felt like\nAny bit of accomplishment I'd ever done with it and it was like I was a cop with a big crack and then when dribs allowed in you know very quickly and I would go back to feeling that it was a failure\nAnd I realized that I didn't feel that way anymore that was just gone I had something that I had done all down on my own two feet and after all this time I owned it\nLets place all of us would love to get them so I Would have got to talk to you again for talking to me thank you Tom

grief by building a musical career of her own and lately she's been working to better understand the father that she lost when she was just a teenager\nCatherine releasing a new documentary called the song and the sorrow it takes a closer look at a father's history with mental illness and as you're about here they really blow to open the general conversation about mental health as well I started by asking her what it was\nThem encouraged her to finally make such a personal documentary\nIt was one of those things where are the direct I'm Ella Clark she came up to me and she said do you want to make a\nDocumentary about your dad and I was like okay and then it took three years so it wasn't really like uh I didn't really think about it too much and it just kind of happened throughout the three years every once in a while and then I Would show up and tell me walking around her playing music or interviewing people [noise]\nUm so it wasn't yeah I didn't really\nKnow what I was getting into when I said yes [laughter] I feel about it in a great you know them I think it's a really a great a tool I guess to be able to talk about mental health and to be able to explore my own history and and all of that\nUm when you were growing up did you know that he was this famous songwriter this ... Canadian songwriter\nI didn't I had I mean I knew that he wrote songs and he played music um that was about it I I knew sometimes his songs that come on the radio when we were in like ... or something you know need here in ... when a dad songs and\nUm but I don't know just it was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly a you know playing not\nIt was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly I you know playing not he wasn't really playing big shows I never saw him play much except community fundraisers and like school\nFriday concerts reveals much fried foods and yeah\nYeah it was it was really cool and ah he would always really generous with the time he was always doing\nStuff like that what was the relationship your dad had with the success of like ... to put your hand in hand\nI only know it through kind of research and watching interviews and stuff 'cause we never talked about it never no um no we never talked about that stuff I didn't know anything about my dad's career directly from him so\nPart of the great thing about this documentary with it I got to really go back and see so much about him and there's some really great interviews from the early seventies when things are just starting to happen and\nYou know he's living in a house on the east end of the island with you know no phone plumbing and you know snow where to just become a massive hit and put your hand in hand is though to be too and it's it's um it's interesting to see him because he really wants nothing to do with the money part of things\nUm and that's yeah I think that sums it up he was very bad with money he gave at all and uh\nAnd it was it I think charming but also you know made life very challenging\nFrom time to time I bet it did so your mom in the film says that your dad was never properly diagnosed\nMhm like he was diagnosed as depressive um but post mortem diagnosed as a bipolar from\nReally digging into his you know what was going on in his life and um yeah it's a strange funny thing\nI really do to people start to kind of map together for you I'm like oh well now some of that stuff starts to make sense\nYeah it took a long time for that it took a lot of reading about mental illness and I'm discovering kind of my own depression anxiety and stuff before I really\nStarted to even I guess yeah I had a bit of knowledge of what was going on but I didn't really until you experience it yourself or you know witness someone going through it I don't think you can really understand it but um we didn't talk about it in our house so I didn't know what was going on\nI mean people just kind of didn't talk about it all back then\nYou know and they're so there wasn't language to put around it and I think that's you know\nOne of the things I've learned from reading is that not being able to talk about it keeps people from getting health and it's you know that's the biggest thing the stigma about mental illness is is the ... the great barrier to early detection treatment and so that's what my goal is to get people talking\nSo after your dad's death your dad died by suicide um you you become introspective you kind of retreat into yourself at least as of this where they get from the film right I mean I was always\nFairly shy um as I became a teenager [laughter]\nUm but yeah I definitely went into my room for a few years and learned how to write songs and um yeah I definitely lived inside a sort of bubble for a long time of not really knowing who I was aware of what's going on yeah [noise]\nUm but I think yeah grief took a long time to unfold and\nI feel like I'm just starting to live a life of my choosing you know where I'm actually making the decisions and not just following\nThe river so yeah yeah what can only even when I first met you Katherine I'm I think everyone several you know that's that's Catherine McClellan nice to meet or do you know do you know her dad is you know I was definitely\nChallenging to to live under that shadow and I I don't you know they want want me to to be like him or to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I can\nSo that shadow and I I don't you know they want want me to to be like him or to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I kind of I have done that of by accident you know I've followed in his footsteps and now I'm really honored to to be part of that lineage and\nI really I'm excited to share his music with people and and to tell a story because\nOn lots of levels you know it keeps his music alive which kind of keep them alive but it also is an opportunity to talk about the hard stuff\nUh my name's Tom power you're listening to Q.
