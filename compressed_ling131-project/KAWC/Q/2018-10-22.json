line from public radio international\nWhich goes by here I Am\nHilary Swank is one of those actors who you'll never be able to pigeon hole what I mean by that is she can basically work with any script you throw it or I mean just look at everything she's been in over the past twenty five years there's the next karate kid there's Beverly Hills NATO to winnow the million dollar baby there's PS I love you\nBut why she might be best known for is her breakout role the one that led to her first Oscar shot her into super stardom\nBoys don't cry boys don't cry was released a huge playing back in Nineteen Ninety nine critics praise Hillary Swank performance as Brandon Tina transgender teenager which was pretty groundbreaking roll\nIt was hard to find transgender characters anywhere in film or or TV at at that time but looking at that film now in twenty eight team it is often challenging to see it in the same kind of light\nMay consider the backlash got your hands and faced earlier this year for being cast as a transgender character\nI had the chance to ask Hilary Swank by her thoughts on all of it and a little bit about her new film walk they had which deals with something that every child has to go through at one point or another\nWhat to do with your parents when they get old we talked about that when she stopped by the cue studio during the Toronto international film festival [noise] so I read this thing about you I'm a talker I Want to talk about what they had a I heard that when you\nYou do very simple thing with scripts to help you focus on the character that you're playing is that right you write something on the page\nOh well it's not very simple actually it's really um complex because\nUm it's my character analysis and break down so it's like a type a Bible I thought it was like one line per page no okay I Know what you're confusing I got it so what I Do with the script is um I break it down into one sentence\nThat story the story of the stories about into one sentence\nAnd you're going to ask me what I was this one about but it's it was now over a year and a half ago so I'm not going to get the exact sentence but what it is is I take\nThe essence of this story and in one sentence I'd say what is this story about and that is on the front of my script but then the inside is really you can barely see the lines\nWhat do you do that one line well why do you need to crystallize it like that\nUm because I feel like that is the essence of the story and that everything should lean back to that essence and if it doesn't it usually doesn't make the movie\nWhat what was worth it going down when you were Fifteen Years old live alone car no I don't ever I that was all worth it for me living out on my car was fun I was Fifteen Years old it wasn't\nHarrowing at all it was from my mom you know but for me I was living my dream and and at er about trying to pursue my dream so it was exciting\nI can tell you still love acting I could still I Love it I can still do you do I I Know sometimes when people come in whether they're going through the survey goes to the cycles a little bit of of putting the phone together but I ... you really do love this guy really\nLove it I really love it and what's interesting is\nTaking time off to take care of my dad\nWas um there was there was no doubt in my mind that that's what I was going to do and I didn't know how long it was going to take and in doing that there were two things that happened one I realized that I'm\nMore than just an actor because you are what you\nDo you know people say oh in Richmond your industry especially but I mean if you really think about if you say oh tell me about you the first thing I Will say is I'm an architect ... they say what they do yeah and I\nAm and I'm so I say oh I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I haven't been doing and\nSo much of who I Am as defined within that and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that and\nUm and\nThere was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say and do you think that changed the way you acted well that would also

is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated all the opportunities that it gave me and it to\nSee the world and a different way to walk in someone else's shoes

really shattered with ... studio snipers is one of the characters you'll meet on his new record a short story about war with shops on friday yeah and it's it's all that good\nCheck and tell you more about these characters in just a second but first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last here\nHow are ya I'm doing great have you on about being here have you on All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\n[noise] yeah I should they be listening to the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I can go to him yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah Peabody Award winning how do you how do you find sitting down with these people the guy looked up to your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like I guess you know what I mean yeah like\nA you know you you sit across from these people in there and they're really fascinating and or their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that that I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing and it's the same thing I felt when I was doing you know your job is uh\nIs these people are also stunned as stunned as you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and or be a part of so um yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting\nHave you had any moment of he can you name the one particular moment of like wow I Can't I Can't believe I'm here right now I mean the\nOne I'd have to say stands out the motives ... kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop and uh we have the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that you know became hip hop so\nThat was very surreal he's not a guy that's very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop you you know and look at the building and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gave out at New York and the world\nAnd it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old pioneered\nSo I I gotta I gotta think that some of this mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or any type of evolution of\nGetting to talk to some of these great mind ... must have impacted the new record somehow [noise] um no it's a weird thing is only indirectly but I'm not in the\nSense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the ...\nI'm not in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meetings so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situations like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have and they also are nervous 'cause they're about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences of impacted the music but they have impact\nAnd if not like you you you hang out grand master flash for the record sounds like rhyme at exact not like that exactly there's all these things yet but it\nDoes like it's a very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah 'cause I always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and ... or strangely aggressive you know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being\nSo you so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio you're doing hip of religion and someone comes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to say to someone you know totally and you don't really know them that well in or the you know there aren't that well yeah\nAnd you are scared a little bit yes and they're they seem a little I don't know the grass was the right word well I mean you met before they walk in I'm Out here where we are very seniors out for the worst and a lot of the album is about why\nAnd why why have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nLike this question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and your bracing herself in the worst how many of them actually attack you are like zero percent yet like very yet I'm almost nobody yeah virtually zero percent\nSo then why do we ah approach each other with that posture and not just each other but you know the album is is also political understands why do we approach you know our politics and you know our our financial um um\nSituations also like with with that kind of posture of either defensiveness or or aggression yeah\nWhy why why a concept album at all then why not a song about [noise]
