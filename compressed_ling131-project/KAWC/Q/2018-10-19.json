public radio international\nWhich goes by ...\nFor a lot of young rock bands out there the kind that are still trying to get noticed the kind that are still borrowing for months at a time their parents mini van lugging their own ... up the back steps a dirty largely empty bars in the back of their mind instead of looking out and playing for the ... staff\nAnd if they're lucky I guess they're cousin came after the show they dream of one day playing a venue so big so filled with their fans that no mere bar could hold them in fact all their fans cousins included we'll pack the local stadium to come see them\nFor our cattle that dream came true\nAfter years of incredibly hard work our Cal paid their dues playing the ... dingy bars across this country but last June they took over ... field in their home town of Hamilton, Ontario performing for over twenty thousand people it was a show they called the rally\nIt was easily a career peak for Mac Mike Tim Tony and Nick and just this morning that band are ... released their brand new record rally cry\nThey also dropped by the cues studio to perform a few songs after new record and talk about what it took to get to that next level and why they were worried that big rally show at the football stadium in Hamilton\nMight not happen are all\nCaptured alive and accuse studio which are ... their new single this is relentless\n[laughter]\nIt feels like a particularly failing in time not just politically but also in an industry the music industry itself can be seen as\nSomewhat cynical one thing I was thinking of is how do you remain on the nickel and walk and be a very cynical industry\nI think well first of all we're lucky that our immediate like crew and and the team that we work with are all kinda hopeful like\nEasy going people you know I think that's a lot a lot of your opinion I think has to do with the company you keep and we're really lucky that we have people in our camp that work really hard and enjoy the work\nOr and so yeah that's a Marie once drowned yourself with ... with people that offer you a little bit of optimism nothing is\nIt's such an impossible job like being a fulltime rock and roll band and paying the bills that way is\nIs a statistically speaking almost ... bonkers it's crazy and so and it ... it despite how much you know success and good fortune we've had as a bad we still get told no all the time there's still many goals were chasing after every single day where we are so now you're you didn't get that festival or no I didn't quite work out for you\nAnd so you got to hold onto the when like for me it's a matter of survival being a little optimistic and hopeful because if you're only think about the the times you're told no then you're definitely gonna just sink immediately [laughter] so I think that like\nFor me it's like a function of just like okay this is how do you get through the day how do you enjoy the work\nAnd uh yeah that that's why I think we have the vision that we do for guys it's been it's been a joy having in thanks so much for coming in ... you you're going to do hand me downs Hamad out something about it this isn't a lot of times you wrote a for the

he's not surprised this one might end up on some wedding play let's do\nIt is a love song do and and we've been lucky enough to have\nUsually about one song for record make its way into a someone's wedding party ... yeah we had a lot like first dances uh come in like a lot of videos this summer people dancing to assign like and then summer my heart so is yours and\nWe mentioned it and after we were going to the this might be a weddings are ... you never go with that ... we go oh yeah we got to go any proposals and our culture has been plenty really there was one there was there I think there's five at the rally proposal during the show I'm not getting\nThe ... and a couple of days we get about ... emails a week about asking to propose on stage and we can't really do that if I show but uh yeah at the rally a yeah there's a number of proposals Daniels either told me stories of the first time some of those is one of his shows uh every once in a crowded in a circle and he just assumed it was a fight [laughter]\n[laughter] he laughs um lot I think I think on average it was about two hundred and fifty pages worth ... per week um\nHe laughs um lots I think I think on average it was about two hundred and fifty pages worth a script per week um that's for the the voice over stuff the cinematic was more condense diplomatic was I'd say what what do you think Michael take ten part time I think\nSometimes we would get a I mean the game itself I think somewhere on twenty two thousand lines or something like that um [noise] so is huge and then ah we would get scripts anywhere from\nHundred and fifty two four hundred and fifty to the ones I I just got a script of nine hundred pages and you're like OK you've got a few days to read this and then go into the voice Bruce and that was weekly you wouldn't do that for for long periods of time which was a lot to ingest I\nHave to take some of those life just be sort of strange like their their lines just in case this thing happens or our alliance can you remember the strangest lined you had to read that but again there were so [laughter] um I remember one is like\nA buck and like I was like how do I do this and not do it like you know I'll be back in\nThe book and just saying just simple lines that are just so known in the world and finding different ways I'm not going there um and we'd have to do weird funny lines like where you're out in a boat going out into the middle of the the sea and you'll be going too far in this incident you'd be like oh maybe ... going too far\nThe ship my sights and you're like re sell us talking as as you're going out there so the audience knew what was happening but it's funny to try and be honest and self talk about what's happening over there is a storm coming I should totally bucket maybe you know this kind of stuff so that was\nThere was really funny things you had to do that you would never really have to do it any other situation\nIf you're just tuning in speaking with Michael Anton ... and a matter of fact the ... the two stars of the new massive videogame assassins creed odyssey that\nI just it's kind of everywhere right now and and Michael ... thought the creative to separate characters but each character goes through in the almost the exact same stories we were saying it's it's pretty much the same thing here's an audio example of you speaking the same dialogue to a character named Marcos\nI was what do you think this site blob since he's come to find you I think they need you hot I Wish it would have told me that before they hit me\nBut that's beside the point\nYou were living in those\nI Wish you would have told me that before they hit me\nYou want to ... Marcos\nSo that's the to be reading essentially the same lines as an actor how do you create a character alongside another actor who is essentially mirroring this same\nPerformance well basically because I think what works so well I'm In a very serendipitous sort of way or maybe not was the fact that\nUm the they you'll be soft did such a great job with um taxing Michael and I and I and I mean that in in the best possible way and I [noise]\nThey found to people that also seem to have a very similar approach to what they hadn't visions as Cassandra like seals I don't know how that happened really so\nUm we had we we found ourselves basically the first conversation which we both thought was going to be very awkward about okay so how do we how do we know about this how do we first start discussing this without stepping on somebody else's toes and blah blah blah but\nWe both stayed at each other at the end his conversation with like wow we completely agree where where this is\nGoing to go and how this is going to play out and how we want to shape these characters so I wouldn't say it was hard at all it's ... it just it just happened so effortlessly and smoothly I'm unlike micro said before if there was anything it was just okay let's see\nIt just happened so effortlessly and smoothly I'm unlike micro said before if there was anything it was just okay let's see how we can make this better but it was thinking as one and not as two separate people anyway that's that's I think how we both felt about it\nWhat what about the idea that I that you can choose within your character in this game a treat out to see\nWhether I kind of wanted to be a jerk or whether I wanted to be a hero like\nMichael what is it like the fish we have to develop a character sort of two characters at once you have to develop a character with Merce multiple personalities who it was neat 'cause I think there was a grounding I had to find for lectures myself like okay who would he be for me and what kind of choice path I sort of hanging on hand\nUm for me is a ... I was ... probably a bit more of the nicer guy uh who who you don't mess with the people and his wife or the people he cares about 'cause then he will destroy a flight but overall that's to me it was the nicer approaches but it then I'm like okay but that's not what some people will choose so you had to really step out of that idea whenever there was those choice wheels and\nAnd go for some really hard decisions that\nYou wouldn't necessarily want to make but you have to so you had those days were hard there were some really challenging scenes that we had to face um you know with certain family members with certain people in our lives have cared about and how we approach them and what we did\nAnd that is a bit of a a mind trip to have to be like okay I went from this happy choice to this super aggressive I'm going to kill your choice and those are really different um and sometimes you have to do it on a dime 'cause you're in a voice bruised and you have so many lines have to get through the day and you're like but I Want it to feel authentic so you've\nYou've just got to try and take the time to get there I'd be remiss if\nI didn't mention this there's no doubt that the the video game rose is traditionally so male dominated ... characters or even in a assassins creed you know Cassandra is one of only a couple of female leads and eleven major releases from the series mess on the do you feel like you're breaking some ground here\nOh man absolutely I mean the fact that the response that I've been getting and the fact that they've been so many young girls that have reached out\nSaying you know um we look up to you and you know we feel that we have a voice now in this world are that way it's been it's amazing to be given the option to play as a woman\nIt's just I think the biggest gift essentially for me but I don't I don't I don't know if I Would say I was doing something particularly groundbreaking but I think the company definitely adds as giving the opportunity for for girls gamers out there to have a voice\nLike if you play the game [noise] ah I've only played a little bit of it so far minds in the mail that's on its way is it freaky to play a game that you're in\nIt's it is funny it is really you know it's the owner knows which are like the sounds we make like the\nFederal and all that could have I I really laugh at all those gestures and and hearing yourself I'm doing certain things and these fights and yeah it is a fascinating thing I'm looking at you right now and I liken this to forgive him for the dog and they give\nI'd be handed a guy with you last night and be a guy last night on my couch [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nBut you know what it is an odd must be an odd\nField it is if it is fascinating and when I was playing and I actually fell out of it ah and I just kinda got into it and then you keep clicking back and you're like oh that's me [laughter] how about you have you had a chance to play as yourself you\nKnow but I watched a lot of the same lines in the mail a I have watched a lot of game play ... man it's very strange I ... I find it very bizarre and I especially I guess I'd say like all the owner than they own Cindy I'm sends a I think my my personal worthless\nBut I find it very bizarre and I especially again I'd say like all the owner than they own the ... and uh I think my my personal worst was um pretend to be on fire which I think a completely failed at doing um you\nCan you give me a little sample of pretending to be on fire\n\nStomach [laughter] and I yeah I I fired Celtics English [laughter]\nWell I I got to tell you the thanks so much for coming in and I just love playing the game and it's such a trip I don't think I've ever met anyone in the video game I\nPlayed before oh cool well You're welcome else could congratulations you thank you thank you ma'am I don't mind [noise] mess on the ... and Michael and to not vote or the lead actors and assassins creed odyssey one of the biggest video games in the world right now\nYou can play the game right now it's available through it will be soft on X. box PlayStation and PC I'm Tom power time for one last song as you're looking\nHead to the weekend you know and this weekend you know maybe sometimes it's three am\nYou're on vacation or you don't have to work the next day\nAnd you're having a little bit of a party four or five of your friends are over and you turn up the music a little too loudly for the hour that it is right you forget that it's later than you think it is and yeah and you mess up and people complain they might file a noise complaint on you they might threaten to kick you out of the air being be that you're saying\nBut at least you hope that the music that people complain about the music that gets called on you in the least bad as music you\nKnow but for me and the ... radio two mornings rented Doris or CBC Music mornings rented or is\nIt was playing bare naked ladies too loud that almost got kicked out of an era being be in Los Angeles three years ago\nThat's not the only anniversary that's on my mind today also Twenty years ago this week that same song that almost got us kicked out of the United states topped the billboard charts and it would end up being very naked ladies only number one single in the u._s.\nIt's banned ships\nFan [laughter] let me\nAsk you\nMight remember the last ... ladies performed one week with Stephen pages just earlier this year at the gym knows you can still go back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Yuma", "day": "19"}
