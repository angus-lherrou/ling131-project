come out oh my God that's ... that's amazing\nIt's extraordinary that he has left so many poems um there were actually recorded and many of them um we started on the last record on while we were making you want a darker\nAnd sometimes I Would implore him even though I knew he was in a delicate stayed at sea dead just just read this just read this home to a to a metronome\nAnd we'll look at it later and there's some of my favorite poems of his are actually\nIn the vault and I was tasked with finishing them and what's also beautiful about them is that unlike a the the very the the gravity and the nature and the ten year and the tone of you want a darker and these have a sort of more missed so romantic a\n... a kind of tone that resembles his older work something more romantic so that's also more surprising is daunting for you to have to to finish her father's work like this\nIt's such a luxury it's such a treat and as I say it's been a meditation because I have a little studio in my backyard and\nI go there with the amount of coffee and and areas again this singer is powerful distinct voice who happens to be particularly stirring for me 'cause it's my father and the sense of responsibility and a and at the same time as I say you know with\nThis this feeling like um how wonderful that ah that these songs exist in that I'm going to bring them see them to see them to

Fox is sister on family ties back in the Nineteen eighties back then Justine couldn't go anywhere or do anything without swarms of fans following her around shouting her characters may Mallory Mallory\nBut then one day something changed all that fame began to disappear and the way she puts it losing fame was like Sam slipping through your fingers\nWhat kind of effect does that have on a person you sky rocket to the heights of fame where you can even eat in a restaurant but people are approaching you just slowly crash back down where you're you know anonymous\nUm [noise] so when it starts slipping I guess you noticed it started slipping in a similar way to realizing in the beginning that you are gaining fame\nUm when you first realize you're gaining fame it's people are listening more intently to you they are they're approaching a more frequently of course they're being far more accommodating and part of use like this is weird what should happen especially when you're in a situation where they don't recognize you at first and you get sort of their normal\nTreatment and then they realized who you are and everything shifts the way they treat you changes almost instantly [noise]\nAnd then when it starts that started slipping\nThat's when you first notice it and and not to make it sound like you like an entitlement thing like you expect to be treated like that yeah but you are I'm prepared to your rather prepared to deal with being overly accommodated you're prepared to deal with that and then when somebody when it comes intermittent\nYou're like oh I'm and I do I need to be prepared to deal with it or do I need to just can I just relax and feel like maybe they don't recognize me and it's all about\nHow can I be set up to deal with what you're going to come out me with and when it started fading almost completely I had to keep telling myself or made it better for me if I just said I'm not famous I'm not famous for not famous at all it all at all\nAnd then if somebody did recognize your did try to overly accommodate me I could just see it as as bizarre behavior\nTo you have a different perspective on it because you were in the you were in it in writing this book than people who could write about fame and more of an edict way like from the third party perspective\nAh absolutely I don't I and and there are you know a lot of books written on fame you know I'm a lot of them take a and historical approach um a lot of them seem to take a I'm sort of than approach like\nHear all these different famous people and this is this is why I like them this is why we like them or days these and these were my few encounters with some of the famous people but what I really wanted to do is bring the reader in to the whole experience the whole life\nAnd more of an edict way like from the third party perspective\nAh absolutely I don't I and and there are you know a lot of books written on fame yeah I'm a lot of them take a hit and historical approach um a lot of them seem to take a I'm sort of a fan approach like\nHear all these different famous people and this is this is why I like them this is why we like them or days these and these were my few encounters with some of the famous people but what I really wanted to do is bring the reader in to the whole experience the whole life cycle and not just\nHey here's what it's like to be famous but really here's what this entire life cycle is like and\nAnd submit to the reader that that fame as a social construct and I I drive parallel between this creation that society has made of fame with the sheets and ladders game board and that around two thousand\nWe almost insisted that game board become larger\nSo that more people would have opportunities to be famous and I just think that that um the striving for that\nLimits us individually to becoming the best people we can be\nJust be Bateman thanks so much for talking to us really appreciate it oh my pleasure thanks for

very ... is your fictional character I Know you spend a lot of time with these ultra rich people the ... thirty five thousand dollar ... uh why why did you learn about\nYeah I remember we once drank an entire thirty five thousand dollar ... scotch and I realize that we're just trying to Hyundai Sonata is worth of a ups guy dates me better it pays pretty good but I'm not sure how they send out is good um\nIt was very stressful or these guys are ... you know they they're stressed out all the time they drink quite a bit uh there were times especially when\nThey're hedge funds were taking that I ended up going home at five AM and my wife was sort of an button in my shirt for me 'cause my fingers wouldn't work and I was born in Russia so I Know how to drink a few a Dram or but it was you know they're not very happy people that was the big\nThe higher I went up the food chain from you know sent a millionaire to billionaire I was like oh my God these are not happy people really are um they leave these very moded existence is where they don't really leave their Upper East side apartment there club there Hamptons stayed there for their funds and so\nI became sort of the hedge fund whisper and I would take him to things like cheap Korean or Indian restaurants and they'd be like oh my God this actually tastes great ... what a life you live\nWhat were you curious about what questions you have for them well that was the question is I knew that many of them came from the sort of lower middle class backgrounds they grew up in the edges of places like New York or Naples or Moscow and my my sort of feeling was and I also came as an immigrant so I knew the sort of the hunger in their souls and the idea that\nYou know we grew up with tough parents the only thing that could make up for it with billions of dollars right um so I wanted to see if upon achieving that wealth if if if things actually did improve\nBut you know studies show that if you win ... billion dollars in the lottery or you lose a limb and about a year and a half you're basically back at your same level of happiness and that's something that I found true for almost all the people I interviewed\nMe I've heard people say that once you can pay your bills once you can pay your bills and\nOnce you're you're you're safe and you're like you know once you get paid off in any money after that is not really going to make any happier\nBut it also works here perceptions I mean I I met a currency trader at a bank and and you know and he said I'm\nThe probably the country's the play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how do you define the middle class and he said just people struggling earning between two and four million dollar yeah poor folks were folks so you know so I think places like Manhattan have just become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world\nWorks and I think that that that because that is our lead in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand six team I Can't begin to know what you're talking you know I don't know if a if you grew up in Russia I was born in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just\nCountries the play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how to find a middle class and he said just people struggling earning between two and four million dollar yeah poor folks were folks so you know so I think places like Manhattan have just become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world\nWorks and I think that that that because that is our lead in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand six team I Can't begin to know you talk I don't know or is he grew up in Russia I was born in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just\nBad news keeps following me around against what was your impressions\nOf American wealth when you were growing up\nEverything seemed incredibly wealthy you know we were we started out we were on section eight housing public housing food stamps all that stuff and ah\nThere's a scene in the eighties movie called Moscow on the Hudson with Robin Williams that kind of capture that moment where Robin Williams cat a character walks into an American supermarket in these five hundred different types of coffee and he says coffee coffee coffee and he has a heart attack\nAnd and that's kind of how we felt almost all the time when we came to America so this is a long time sort of obsession or at least interest you've had in the lives of the super wealthy well when I was a kid you know I remember watching the movie Wall Street and uh we were the poor I was the poor kid in my Hebrew school called the ... school of queens and I was wearing a\nCoat made out of some Soviet ... or something that had a very unattractive smell in the ... was my nickname so we were very poor and and and back then at least I wanted to I really did want to make money I remember watching Wall Street thinking oh my God this is a the Charlie Sheen character up until he gets arrested that's that's the life\nBut after ... spending time with these guys I'm almost allergic to money 'cause I see just how how how little it does for anybody and these poor families you know um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Yuma", "day": "01"}
