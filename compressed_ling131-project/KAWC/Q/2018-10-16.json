I mean everything is up for grabs now this isn't a very exciting time um and uh definitely changes happening and er and er it hopefully things will go on moving um\nPersonally I think uh you know I'm gay I just need to be able to play straight pilots I don't understand why\nAll the straits acts as a can go and play gay pots and everyone just to see you know how to do it but somehow the mindset of the powers that be this doesn't work or in the other direction or they always blame the audience they say oh the audience wouldn't accept it but um\nI think uh this is not true is to do with the mindset in in what remains of the\nBoys club of um [noise] the people in power in the executive branch and uh that has to that is the thing that still I feel needs to launch the change\nSure this is something you've experienced yourself absolutely and it does it make you reflect on that I mean when I tell people I was interviewing the day I was kind of talked about Oscar Wilde and and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding there was some\nReflect on that I mean when I tell people I was interviewing you today I was kind of talked about Oscar Wilde and and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding Davis them to a lot of the road and you had in the in the nineties [noise] daddy reflecting that time now do you like thinking back to that time\nBut it was a very exciting time uh and I'm an unbelievable time for me it was like it was one of those kind of dream come true type of times in one sense that I could ... much open to such a\nA successful place for my best friend's wedding and uh that film went so I'm incredibly well for me but in one sense or a\nOr the you can only go so far I'm playing the gay best friend I mean you have to kind of be able to come up with something else along the line otherwise ah the audiences will get bored\nAnd I think from to graduate to any other kind of rule was seemed to me to be impossible and then as soon as my gay best friend a road seem to fail\nThat was when the lights kind of snapped out\nMy I I I don't think that's something we talk about enough we had a ... on the show a few weeks ago dressing bathing played played Mallory and the and I think it was family ties I Believe which is a show I I didn't see right ah and she wrote this book most recently about\nBecoming less famous um and I had never really heard anyone talk about that before becoming less fame yeah she was she ... she wrote a book about why one at one point people walk down the street and yelled at our character's name and then one day they didn't and and how unsafe sometimes you feel when you're when you're less famous and all the things you get used to that you that you don't want to admit that he got used to\nWhat it's like being dead and that is the greatest um um opportunity of it too because in one sense you become like a ghost or ... guys you'll still screeching around the ... power but everyone's looking straight through you\nAnd the oldest of the ideas everyone thought it was fabulous when you were famous or their boats to buy a new a new um persona\nAnd I think it feels exactly what it feels like being a goes to kind of trapped in the world and you really have to die\nAnd I think that gives you a new missile petunias because dying to yourself is a really one of the great ah possibilities and

power\nI don't know if you've got the chance to head out to the pictures of this weekend and maybe you finally caught a star is born which is sitting strong at number two at the box office right now\nRight behind that his first man which is winning over a lot of critics as well but there's another film that's getting even better reviews than those two they hate you gave is already showing up in theaters but it will open everywhere this weekend it's already got a Ninety seven percent score on rotten tomatoes I cite that aggregates all the reviews that are out there right now\nAnd it makes sense when you realize the book was based on this huge bestseller written by Angie Thomas\nThe hate you give follows stark Carter a sixteen year old black girl it takes a closer look at everything she grapples with after her best friend shot by a police officer and star happens to be the only witness\nObviously it's a very timely story it's one that spoke to ease array who's an actor who's on the show insecure and HBO show she created that show she plays April and the hate you give and she's an activist who star looks up to each race stopped by the cues studio right after the movie premiered at the Toronto international film festival\nAnd as you're about to hear this was the story is a feels is important and reliable\nI heard of the book but I haven't read it until um the conversations about the film came out and when I read the book of\nJust absolutely in love and then read the back story about you know Angie writing like as they're seeing these days than just the journey that she's taken is absolutely inspirational what was it about the book the ...\nI mean the perspective of a young black female dealing with you know the aftermath of her friends that the ... of her role in in growing up in the hood of going to a white school is just incredibly reliable and\nJust the young black tea must perspective specifically you know you don't get to hear about\nYou know there's Trayvon Martin's friend who is you know the the key witness and what she was going there and I think about Philando Castile fiance like those are perspective and and the grief that they have to endure for a long period of time it's just you don't think about that well\nLike I said there's like so many complex issues in in the heat that you're giving me racial profiling police brutality code switching and as you point out we're talking about a movie but talking about a book here but the real life conversations that people are living in having all the time\nThat's the unfortunate part is that this will always be timely until it's not\nYeah it is the conversation's happening in the book how closely does that parallel conversations are happening in your own life just with you and your friends\nI mean there's definitely an exhaustion is discussing it you know we we all have our own group chat like there's so many\nGroups had some men were will bring them up I'm just as like what do we do or what can we do or here's another one and it's just like the feeling of hopelessness and I think this film in particular um is about\nFinding a voice and\nOf hopelessness and I think this film in particular um is about finding your voice and that's also it's inspirational about like trying to figure out what you can do\nIt just the stars of sixteen years old in the heat that you do um she's seen a police brutality death is as you said what is it about her the mixture so reliable as it makes so many people bomb onto her\nShe's a teenager and I think we all remember during that time when you're just trying to\nFit in your try not to stand out you're just trying to also find out who you are here and start happens to be doing all those things and happens to lose her best frantically filing for marriage and trying to figure out who you are and to find your voice\nWhen you you need it the most and um\nFor me it would make star labels that yeah I went to high school in the ... but also had an experience you know going to a private school and having to balance those personalities so degree the person is like she has to be a certain way\nOr so she thinks of why people and then gets to feel most comfortable and her skin with black people but also have to kind of ... to a degree and um I think so many people of color have been there\nBut I mean that's that's accurate and so you just keep pushing and there's just certain elements that you know that people will relate to and if you don't get you don't get ... percent\nThat's what I meant I never said don't you dare watch this laypeople and men like that's just I was just like I wasn't thinking about that audience when I wrote this and they're watching and relating and that's great\nTo think about the heat you gave is an ... said she wasn't seeing stories being told that reflected her and her friends she made it herself first and then she shopped around she made it herself and then waited for people to come to it and I and I bet you can see a parallel there\nA hundred percent I feel like that's the model I think that's a model for so many black people for so many people have called the creators like I've seen that that's kind of been the trend for getting people to notice you is like\nFor salon Hollywood has been like this isn't this isn't going to be marketable this isn't going to have an audience and because of the Internet because of social media because of sort of this stuff fishing way we've been able to prove them wrong time and time again and so now\nThey're like clamoring for content from
