I read that when you joined the b._b._c. the trainee in the early fifties you had very little experience of it you'd you'd barely watched it is that right\nWell nobody had really I mean not to fifty two or the number of people you couldn't see TV and in London you couldn't see anywhere else in the country are\nOn the number of people who have sets for number didn't in a few thousand if that uh so uh hardly anybody would say in television and the cameras really using and the students are using were the ones which provided the first television public service\nIn the world ever so and we were still using them and they started in Nineteen thirty eight and a six sided shake\nSo what was the potential Utah for nature and television programming\n[noise] um well the time we and hardly anybody had done any programs about anything really I mean except I'm cooking a knitting and politics um um quiz shows and gardening but a ... is\nBut so they actually going out into the wild or wasn't what TV did um television I hadn't in these jobs speaking now the BBC in London\nOr we didn't have the money to the fast or go to Africa let alone the costs of making films television uh I wasn't an offspring of radio and the people who run radio said most of the money is ours I Will just give you a little bit don't spend too much of the same time I knew something you don't spend it on a half or\nSo it wasn't until all of them are written in the business for a couple of years and I managed to persuade people to let me take a film camera to Africa One\nOf the first show that he did was zoo quest you would travel around the world filming London Zoo staff getting animals for the zoo we have a clip from that show from Nineteen fifty six when you were in Indonesia\nOne man said that when he had been in the funniest a few days ago he had seen a very large stake in one of the three maybe he said it's still there [noise]\nBut the the planet now faces so many environmental challenges how do you strike a balance in these pieces without a between revealing the beauty of nature without ignoring the devastation currently facing the planning [noise]\nWell you you you can't go on all the time for Fifteen minutes or a law\nSaying everything as it is also look how gossiping at all is that is putting things the wrong way round you have to start by saying look this is marvelous this is beautiful this is fascinating this mysterious and this is wonderful look at it enjoy it and then you can say\nA ... and we are causing huge problems to this\nBut you're defeated the other way around you you can't do a whole program which is spending your own time saying this is designed to at least you can't do it very often\nAnd then she got a week to show a which ah some of our programs are their own for seven weeks on Sunday summonses is Thirteen you come say every every week it's a dissolves catastrophe you have to\nTime meal punches are you hopeful for the future of the planet\nI'm actually I'm more hopeful than I was\nAbout ten years ago really um ah well I I I couldn't see the disasters were overwhelming or an increasing number and I couldn't see any way out of it and I couldn't see any beams hope but actually the the whole issue\nIncreasing number and I I couldn't see any way out of it and I couldn't see any beams hope\nBut actually the the whole issue has become global in the last ten years\nNow I mean China for example which used to be just I'm pulling up pulling fumes into the atmosphere China has realized that they can't go on this way China's done something about getting it ... projects going\nSo that I'm ... and and all around the world I'm a people I began to realize that they have a responsibility not only about the atmosphere but about the oceans are some things are moving and we have after all stopped uh uh um for hunting wells which was\nFifty years ago was a major major problem that is in it but that's not to minimize the disasters as a looming I mean what what's happening to the seizes is catastrophe\nAnd how are we going to fix that internationally because it has to be out internationally I don't know but at least more people are aware of what the problem is the ...\nAnd eventually I just hoping that as it were people power is going to make the politicians take take notice of what has to beat them\nToday but you know when you when you look back at at everything you've done so far is there one is there one moment something you've seen that really sticks with you\nThat there are lots I mean the the gorillas is I'm but I'm never allowed to get to those who I'm voting monitoring the pumps and about them because that was the most wonderful moment\nBut also one of the most moments subjectively a memorable as far as I'm concerned was the first time I put on scuba gear and dived a on a coral reef a and that was in Nineteen fifty five\nUm and then you are surrounded by\nA hundred or two hundred three hundred organisms you've never seen a lot of your life\nThey are incredible beauty extraordinary things you never knew existed there's no idea what kind of things out that's on the reef and I'm not smart animals are not frightened of you and they stream all around you that is a breathtaking my ... never forget\nAnd it's one of the great tragedies is coral reefs are on the way out unless something really extraordinary happens and the nations of the world really do manage to get together to do something about marine pollution and about a I'm a study pollution and temperature rise things\nAnd they are crucial to the life of the oceans because they're the ... is a bus numbers of species of oceanic fish let's learn coastal fish\nAnd the salt to remind the my grandchildren and all my great

like heartbreaking it's beautiful mark joins me in Studio ... tell you about it high\nBuddy how's it going very good it's interesting to have this book out because in my eye when writing it you're just alone you know and you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where these\nI wouldn't writing it you're just alone you know and you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where these lovely folks in the book club came and they sort of asked me questions about the book and my initial reaction was well how'd you do that and I realized oh wait I published I so yeah so it's interesting to see how people reacting to it in the world\nWell that's the I was when I thought you were putting out a book you would have been forgiven for putting out a book about your exploits about you know about you know everything you're done and twenty to everything you did before that but you told them really personal stories here well why does the impetus that\nWhen he started going down through the the the story of of your childhood I guess it gets pretty reflective and I think there's like a it's it's a it's a natural thing is to censor yourself\nAnd going on I could put that into our shouldn't say that I as a certain point has decided okay I'm not going to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna write what what I Want to write what I feel like I should write well I'm drawn to write\nAnd some of that was funny and some of that was sad and and uh it all came together or hopefully in a way that's enjoyable\nOne of my favorite characters in the book is your mom or this is one of my favorite quotes you write she drove a car or the way someone might fire a starter pistol for the first time eyes closed and facing away yeah\nMy mom would go in there kind of like back in the seventies it's evil can evil being strapped in\nI was like a shot across the grand cable she would often accelerate and close your eyes and get into I remember once we're in driving down cannot roaches big major highway in St john's and moms say oh that was in the wrong lane ethic not we're not wearing the bank and then we'll come back ... mount these car\nAnd he's like I Can't be driving like that and then just coming to and looking back at that I don't think that was weird well I think it was that they just at the end those ages is out of kids not doubt we'll put them in the backseat till he wakes up like there was no different kind of knew for land shout or he'll be alright shake it off\nAnd you didn't you talk about going to school thinks races out Monday pond which I really should not be so colloquial about you were in St traces which is a school in east in St John yeah Catholic school and area we we we know is Monday pond yeah a beautiful part of town a bit of a hard part of town it was harder than and it\nWas you know kind of a I guess you'd call it tough school like you know like one of those places that don't go up around their dollar the clouds Monday bond they'll get you kind of a thing but I was kinda more generational going back to had a reputation everybody with is there was lovely but\nI mean kids who went to school there many of them had been in fights and stuff like that and I had never been around children really because we lived\nFar away from the center city next to a radio station where my where my dad worked\nAnd he was sort of the emergency go to guy or so we had to live next to the station in case a DJ fell asleep during the night or a translator without\nSo there were no other kids around so when I went to school it was my first kind of interaction or with other kids so I'd be sitting there ... and then they could smell the fear in me you know so that was overwhelming\nYou were bullied and the most new Finland nerd kind of way in which they stole your Pepsi oh yeah not Koch now you're happy you're ships yeah and your cello yes the nuns maybe played cello because I was the huskies child and they're like we\nThink you could live to ... which is you know as all\nGreat maestro are chosen by the instrument for they could you know the the the people with ... syndrome a hollow bones they they play whistles and looted and an Oscar children are given shallow\nAnd uh yeah so these guys there was a family of them like everybody was like as one of those places where like all the school and my brothers are coming there as before cell phones but somehow at three o'clock\nSeven brothers of varying ages who look just like the guy be weightless oh how do you shop my broader at race that's grown mad cow or going to fight that we don't have children\nAnd so these guys stole my cello which is like I said you were going to be ... for a challenge like what are you going to do\nDon't have children\nSo these guys stole my cello which is like I've never even got to be ... for a cello said what are you going to do with the ... like there's a big guitars and you don't even know what it is you're stealing\nAnd yeah then I had to get my cello back so that was a a that was a [noise] it's it's hard to feel tough after ...\nBut it led to a really beautiful moment it led to a moment of great empathy so you go to the bullies\nHouse yeah go to his house and the cello have been hidden in his backyard\nAnd um so we're going through the house and and we had to get there and his father was gonna passed out asleep watching wrestling shirtless without some cans of beer around and you know that great new lands version of the thinker and we went down to the back yard and and I find my cello\nAnd I'm looking at my job back to the house and I was like I had to call my parents like you can't you can't you can't do that you wake him up and I'm like ... I'll be quiet and then it's like uh I I call home and I'm like Oh hi and as he wakes up and\nThese are what are your own and our stealing our phone and kind of like\nIt was like well no that's money it's a local call out the bonuses of horror and it got\nReally and and then he he ah hit my friend and and wait a minute break for it and then you kind of realize like oh I see while you're like yeah I see while you're ... you're ... you're paying for it and then after that you know we became you know kind of close friends and uh and he was kind of protected me a bit yeah\nThe ... the great story of new land is going to get things stolen from there were some of my favorites my brother told me about his buddy who got his dog stolen from his backyard one time and he went down to his house knocked on the door and said excuse me I think it's still my dog and the buddies father when no no I didn't steal your dog and he saw the dog in the back in the kitchen like I have\nOne really yeah I I got I was going out with a lady and a malamute was stolen and and and then they almost our dog was stolen and the guy called said he wants money for and this is the name I gave you a name and phone number yet and I was like [noise]\nI Know him and then I had to go to his house and I knocked and everybody was a walk\nAnd was it the guy who got dog stolen forty down there and I was like okay yeah so I go in there and he opens the door like\nHigh there and he's like Ohio and we went to school together and you got a dog and the dog's name was Scott ... notice no dog here and I said here Scott Scott's got the\nDog came running as well just keep this between ourselves and her parents thought I was connected to the underbelly of dog thievery and I we had to break up\nI just as soon as you were if you're just tuning in with a best buy me that's why you're here last week we mark Critz you probably have a seeing him on December twenty two minutes he just released a new book all about his own life as son of a crutch a childish new Finland memoir", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Yuma", "day": "03"}
