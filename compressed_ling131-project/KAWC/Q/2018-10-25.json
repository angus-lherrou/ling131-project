goes by NPR I\n[laughter] so I don't know how into um literary gossip you are but earlier this year there was a bit of an upset in the book world had to do with the man Booker Prize which is sort of the Oscar as sort of the enemies of literature so the upset was for the inclusion for the first time ever a graphic novel in the list of finalists\nThe book is called Sabrina by nectar now so it didn't end up winning the prize but it did get people thinking about the boundaries we set up between one form or another and why why we feel the need to differentiate between art forms at all and that's something that Catherine ever Matt has given some thought to\nYou see she wanted a governor generals award as a poet and came close to winning his second as a novelist for a book you might be familiar with called the break she writes children's stories and most recently she writes graphic novels\nHer first one came out last year it's called him making more than she is following up with a sequel at the end of November and if you asked Katherine ever Matt how she manages to move between these worlds the institutions like the man Booker or the governor general see is entirely separate\nWhile her answer makes a lot of sense\nThey all are about you know kind of me am I Am all in there somewhere as as we all are an artist and they they seem to coincide like it's a kind of holiday you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feel very close to that because I was working with climate\nThe chronology you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feel very close to that because I was working with collaborators and I was ... ... people who are much more talented than I was\nAnd really kind of directing how things look and I got to do that visual stuff and the graphic novel would you do very very differently and poetry and then pros\nSo those feel more connected and maybe then um say the other earlier stuff\nI find through all the all your work a lot of a lot of it focuses on youth or like teenager years adolescence what what do you find so fascinating about that\nWell I I really started the book of poetry came out when my eldest daughter was I think twelve\nSo I was really kind of coming explain my own adolescence as I was approaching these [noise] these two teenage girls who are about to uh take me through the ringer so a lot of that would be from my girls and from their friends and my nieces and nephews [noise]\n'cause they're really of that era but\nYou really remember the things that happen to you as you're you came of age she really they're very impactful or you as you go forward [noise] um I Know in in studying different like you know education things about the brain and how when we're teenagers we actually hardwired all of those habits\nAre so that we actually do remember things when we're Seventeen a lot better than we remember things that happened say when we're twenty five [noise]\nUm and the way we deal with things in the way we look at life is really made in the course of those those times when our brains are actually forming around our hopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my case anyway\nYou directed a documentary called this river you want a Canadian screening word for it and a documentary tells the story of your brother Wayne and went missing in guide and and maybe the reason I'm asking so many questions about those teenage years because I was really struck that you were to fourteen when he disappeared and like why would why was that the right time to tell the story [noise]\nMy part in the documentary came about 'em really reluctantly I really wanted to talk about a drag the red and the efforts that are going on right now with people who have a loved ones who are murdered or are missing\nAnd then I get through that I realized how close I was to that story and how much I really felt\nUm a kinship to these efforts in and bringing awareness and in some cases in the case of drag the red literally looking physically looking for these lost loved ones I'm part of it was the idea that\nIt's so unfortunately so common in some neighborhoods in some communities that uh no one's untouched you know and during the course of that documentary no one that we worked with I didn't know of or with close to someone who had been murdered her missing and it was being searched for", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "25"}
