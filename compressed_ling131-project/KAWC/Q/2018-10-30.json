I found there for making that make their that's fantastic so I'm going to the vet you recognize a few of those jam surrender random there David Bowie Diana Ross philosophy were buying it towards the idea Will Smith who eats used a pretty famous sample there\nBasically if you've worked up a sweat dancing to any of those songs before even if you have to tell chances are you're a big fan of now Rogers whether you know it or not he's the music mastermind behind a lot of\nThose songs and samples you just heard he spent the last five decades winning Grammys and producing them playing some of the biggest pop music hit ever\nAnd I'll have to own band Sheikh become a huge in the seventies then he held David belly and Diana Ross make the biggest records of their careers you help Madonna create them her earliest heads he helped pave the way for hip hop to become as big as it is today I don't know if you remember that big record from ... punk a few years back remember get lucky yeah\nThat's Nile Rogers to playing guitar and that and co writing it\nRecently now Rogers is put out a bunch of new music under his old band name sheik and he stopped by the cues studio to talk about the latest record he's worked on but just so much music there's so much history with now Rogers we had to go through some of it we had a living legend in our midst\nSo we decided to start here\nThat is the Beatles in a day in life I think it's only sitting in front of you that I realized how cool Paul McCartney baseline\nTime I I Swear to God God I just sat down with theme nice voice leading me like\nI never thought about that but I think just being with me and I go to the this kind of funky that's ... that's the voice yeah for sure if that's the first one you learned guitar is that right Harry first thing I've learned to put on guitar how did that happen\nUm well I was a clarinet is and I grew up during the hippie movement and um that was the sexy rock and roll thing to play\nA and and I was a sharing an apartment with this girl who had a band that she needed a guitar player well because I could already read music well I've thought a how hard could this be like everybody in the work and play guitar\nAnd I picked up the guitar I tuned it improperly and she fired me right on the spot\nAnd then I learned to tune the guitar properly and I had a Beatles song book and that was the first song I work my way through but I remember reading about you you were somehow involving the black panther party point or another big time I was a subsection leader\nOf ah the ... of a a section called the lower Manhattan Black Panthers and we were part of what they call the Harlem branch um people have a very um\nThey they don't really have a very accurate picture of the way the black panther party was organized at all it's all like yeah wacky hearsay and stuff\nBut the truth is that it was actually quite organized and it was organized and what they called the ten ten ten system so the way it was supposed to work was each state\nWould have ten branches each branch would have ten sections each section would have to end subsection so I was a subsection leader of the lower Manhattan and branch\n... each section would have done some section so I was a subsection leader of the lower Manhattan and branch I mean a lower Manhattan a section of the Harlem brat\nSo we grew up in a time where it was the beginning of you know the civil rights movement had really started to ... was really developed um\nSo it was the ... the time of the black power movement but what was really important is that we were at the beginning of\nOther movements like the gay pride movement and the women's movement all of that stuff we have named Omar and so right exactly so so the Panthers were seen as the vanguard of the revolution so to speak em I Want to hear some arm you could take a listen to that\n\n\nAs modern love from David ... an album he produced with my guest rock and Roll Hall of fame producer and guitarist musician now Rogers admitted that they see what's cool about this now it's like listening with you I'm ... I'm listening to the other stuff so I'm listening to like my really cools are in charge there just turn it back up\nFor just tuning into cue I'm Tom how are you listening to a little bit of get lucky from death policy drink for Williams also featuring guitar playing for my gas to the guy who co wrote a Grammy Award winning producer rock and Roll Hall of famer and living legend now Rogers like Lindsey\nVonn then wouldn't think again\nKnow if this came around and only tell me as much as you want to tell me about this came around that it sort of a scary personal time for you to read yeah yeah I er was recovering\nFrom I'm from extremely aggressive prostate cancer and um the doctors were not certain of my outcome\nUm and I was just doing what I was supposed to do what they told me to doing you know walking five miles a day and uh you know after I had my prostate surgically removed\nAnd um and of course they monitor you to see if they got all the cancer because that's the problem with cancer is that you know they could still be microscopic parts that haven't shown themselves and you know and they think you're fine and next thing you know they go oh my God it's come back\nAnd in fact it really hadn't left they just hadn't gotten it or sometimes it does come back\nSo in my case I was in the initial recovery periods\nWhen I got the phone call which is how we sort of\nWound up hooking up together because we had been trying to hook up together for years\nAnd every time I Would go to France who will be some kind of strike and I could never get to where they were going to have read that there were I was and I and I used to think that was cool because I said you know when I was a kid\nWe had strikes all the time and now in America nobody's strikes over anything and I you know whatever do you feel different since that since that scares that Mm\nI'm no I'm not really um the the 'cause I've had I had a second bout of cancers since the first big one um\nAnd um [noise] you know I'm ... and I've lost so many really close friends\nUm you know like you you know you think about the people in the Sheikh organization the original she'd organization when I look at that original picture of us would Luther Vandross Bernard Edwards Tony Thompson Raymond Jones I'm ray Maldonado five people in that photo\nEvery male except for myself and Rob um have passed away every guy um\nAnd uh it just it's so weird because I was the most reckless because I grew up\nWith the sort of most ... type ... parents you know\nThat I you know I tell people that I've never been given a curfew in my entire life my parents never ever said to me now come home when the lights come on or anything like that because they knew that instinctively I knew to come home when there was nothing else to do we got we got one more song for you to listen to this [noise]\n\n\nThat's just a little taste listening they'll from now Rogers and she\nSaid the world falls right yeah featuring a a ... a big mess and coach that they're going to come and grab you at some point I'm sure you've been talking for so long but that's cool man the longer the is better for me as a last question the bit of an abstract one okay I assume that one of these days I'm going to get to watch the Nile Rogers'\nStory on film you know what I mean I'm gonna get to see that game and they walk the line that like you're really extras\nOne of these days I'm going to get to watch the Nile Rogers' story on film you know what I mean I'm gonna get to see that day when they walk the line there's like you're really extraordinary life you've fled so let me put this to you you were watching the movie the credits are rolling what song is playing\nWow that's a cool question I've never heard it put to me like that before I Would imagine it would be good times um and I think the reason why would be either good times or maybe we are family\nUm just because those two songs for us I'm\nReally were life changing and maybe I'm\nSo we're family was really important because we knew that we created\nYou know we created a phenomenon with justice to such a Sledge yeah I mean they would fight you know like we really proved to ourselves that we could do what we did for ourselves to someone else and maybe even better um\nAnd ... and and good times because of what happened after good times with hip hop I mean it's just you know um I I remember watching um uh an interview with L.
