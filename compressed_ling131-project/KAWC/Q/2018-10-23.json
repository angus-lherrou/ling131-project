public radio international\nWhen you think about successful fashion brands you might think about runway shows and red carpets and very in models and most definitely clothing that doesn't seem to be made for your body or necessarily your life will tend to Taylor has been challenging that ever since she started designing women's where\nKenyan mix clothing that's really expressive it's sunny it's optimistic bold prince geometric shapes bright colors\nAnd just like real life optimism it catches on her client currently include Taylor Swift beyond say\nFor us a first lady Michelle Obama but these are not the type of clothes that are just made it for the red carpets and models among us\nTime to design clothes for all ages all shapes and I think it's something that a lot of her peers just don't do I'm excited to talk a little bit more about it and I'm excited to have perhaps Canada's most prestigious designer right now China Taylor in our studio high I thank you for having me it's such a joy to have to hear you grew up in Toronto\nGrew up in Toronto I went to high school here and then the guilt university then Parsons in New York\nSo when you were growing up in Toronto to the world a fashion seem accessible to you\nI don't even think I knew there was a rather fashion when I was growing up in Toronto I think my world fashioned consisted of my mom and my grandma and how much they loved\nGetting dressed up playing with close playing with color but I didn't realize that it's an industry and I think it wasn't until I moved to New York and really saw how creative\nAnd commerce can kind of co exist and how beautiful it is to have kind of both of them\nIn a job and you know we're all together but the ... like you grew up painting a semi mom um she we had a rec room in the basement and it probably 'cause I was an only child and I needed some activities to keep me busy she gave me free rein to paint anything\nWant it on the wall so doubtful only child stuff to write a yeah yeah that's great that's not a family of six paint your imaginary friend\nAlso though an only child stuff there\nThat ... family of six [laughter] paying your imaginary friend [laughter] so\nI did I recreate it into this retro landscape of like old cars and old um Hollywood actresses and very artistic lotta paper mash a a lot of arts and crafts my house and I think that that was kind of a starting point of expressing myself through painting and through creating\nThings forgive me for this because I mean as you I wore my best bomber jail every guy I wore the best stuff I have [laughter]\nI Wish you guys could see it I were the best stuff I have for today I feel flattered so forgive me I'm going to I'm going to try this fat I feel like when I see your work I see elements of paintings ... times your work feels like a campus with pain on us\nThank you well we paint all of our presence in our studio in New York and\nI never intentionally started the company thinking that would be how we express the story or tell customer what we're feeling but it's kind of the easiest most personal way to do it and I'm so we spend weeks of painting and then we create them we create all of our fabrics based on our paintings\nSo I'm gonna ask you to do something a little challenging for me okay can you describe the aesthetic of tiny trailer on the radio\nA wide range of inspiring woman and we decided to have lunch with them where each of them were a different look bad very different body types we let them style it any way they wanted to like one woman more her husband shirt underneath one of our fed addresses and brought her bike to the lunch and that was cool like her walking in versus how\nWe would put it on a Seventeen year old model and have to ... and everything would not be able to move like adjusts there was a whole different context of how to appreciate clothing and we were really excited with how it was received\nDo you think the traditional runway shows getting kinda boring\nI think she now should do it because they have the budget and it's like the fantasy but I think that runway should be about fantasy and when your brand is based on reality it's probably not the right format\nOr you had like a Starbucks or in like due to Starbucks all the time you ever sitting at a Starbucks having a cup of coffee and civil walks in wearing your clothes yes it was a few\nThe coolest that's that's when you feel like you've got a gold star that day\n[noise] what do you mean I feel like whenever I Would do something good at home when I was a kid I got a gold star on a little piece of paper in my bedroom and it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to celebrate it in a public way but it feels like you've done something where you'd made that person's day better\nIt must be feel so rewarding it's rewarding definitely it's been so great talking to you I think there's a lot of people listening to this is who like myself sometimes find the world of fashion I'm older scary sometimes I Am I'm definitely getting better at it but there's a lot of people who can't afford expensive clothing maybe people when they read vote when to pick up ... don't see themselves reflected in it\nYou're someone who cares a lot about inclusive witty what what do you say to them\nI think fashion as approachable I think that magazines aren't necessarily where you need to look to be inspired for fashion and I think that just being out in Toronto or being out in a city and watching how\nWomen feel confident expressing themselves individually is probably where to get inspired what do you think of as the motivates you\nMaking women happy I Love doing that right now through clothing but I think that we have found ways to partner even recently with you\nKnow hospitals and different organizations to start spreading a message of color and joy and that makes me really happy 'cause it was a closer but you're doing yeah it's we did one yesterday at second hospital and\nBecause we paint all the time we've decided that we want to take painting to pediatric hospitals and we started MS canned New York\nAnd we hosted a painting class in their community center and kids can come and join with their siblings 'cause there's a lot of activities that are\nNot geared for both of them to be able to kind of bond and be kids together and yesterday we did that tickets and it's awesome it's the kid says the technology to actually film you in a studio painting and then they broadcast and each of the patients friends so it's it's pretty ... it's all\nIt's it's really cool talking to you well thank you very much for coming to be here it's so nice to meet you [laughter] you too there was a Canadian fashion design to tend to Taylor
