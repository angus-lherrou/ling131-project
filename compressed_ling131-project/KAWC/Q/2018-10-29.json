get started it was kind of an accident certainly my part of it was but I did do the first one with the wind or back in the early summer of two thousand and three and it's the team plus years now and it was incredible fun I'm\nI'm Dave wider and I am a media hyper and I'm I'm always trying to find new forms of human expression using technology and I in a real sense among the creator of pod

yesterday\nAnd I noticed Berkman\nSo I looked him up and I tried to explain what this ideal [laughter] and I'm afraid Chris a blues gears said this is radio for the Internet Chris it's like a Web blog which is what we call blogs back then accepted with audio\nAnd he said will have some fun I Know programming and syndication you know radio with the world needs is a MP three audio files that can be syndicated and so we set to it and about I don't know two months later he so I think we've got it\nAnd I said what do we do know that and he says that's on this you're going to interview me put it out to the world\nKnow what kind of democratic experiment is blog idea\nWell um gosh what changes all the time when we first started doing this it was just a bunch of people sort of of writing hello world

programming but he had sought me out to do it with him in and I did my on my part when it could but he he he knew what we were doing and I was just on the right\nIt is no coincidence that spring of two thousand and three was started the Iraq War\nPresident George W. Bush has launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity has been hit\nAnd let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and uh and\nAnd and all are well\nWe're a little excited David I'm sure the obvious but yet we attack\nThem they win Berkeley American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they own endorsed it no sort of the consequences\nAnd the blogging and eventually pod casting became one way for ordinary people to speak their mind on the subject that you know the great wise focal our society had completely missed not was the beginning it was people looking for a way to speak their mind [noise]\nI Want to ask you the route political question which which has to do with the Bush administration and the and the war in Iraq\nWell I mean it's ... marine number one so she is just amazing a number two when I was trying to put together all my research for when I entered Buffy for power in the blood and twenty Fifteen\nI was really frustrated by the lack of information I could find 'cause I'm a researcher I like to dig deep you know and there are just so many black faces that um you know music\nThe traditional places where I Would go to find out about musicians of that kind of iconic status uh had it written about her so I felt like she's really been kind of like a race for music history if you're not sort of written about ah there's no record of your work we all know of course that she's an icon and amazing\nUh but I just really felt like she you know her work and and everything she had been quite minimized\nAnd ah after we had our conversation\nFor power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone she's had allowed and I was like\nOh it's amazing\nAnd um I really left that injury wanting to think about writing on an authorized biography of Buffy ... Marie\nSo Bobby was it hard to put the trust him someone to tell your story no not\nReally and I was so glad that I'm\nI'm you know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise] um because uh there's ... there's so much that comes through in her writings she's a beautiful writer she's real intelligent is real funny [laughter]\nAnd she can see if she can just kind of see be between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both to show and the business and that's always been real important to me both of them and it really is a difference between the show and the business and so she could see that I kind of been abused and get their own by the business that the show is still a little ... a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably\nHave damp and your spirit at all and I I Am one thing I Love this book does is that it does set the record straight on a couple of things that I think people get wrong about ... feet for example you you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know and sort of if you think if we would start a Andrea in the book she points that out yeah people almost every concert in the U.S someone will come up doing if they were so good at Woodstock I just love you you really just a best friend and I would die [laughter]\nWhat do you go I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and they tell her the same thing it was so good at Woodstock and she wasn't there either I don't know I guess I don't know what they were ah smoking that day but you know drugs or I were there on the assumption\nIs that you would be because you were such an important part of that time so I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut it's interesting that this myth of some times bigger than the actual story itself and it and it leads me to some of the challenges he must have had an injury I mean you knew he was born I reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't a lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story above your life with such little information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because I Do care so much research and I really care mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's\nNever been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame\nIt would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's never been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge life that's Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lens to it\nI think this is the I think this is the part of the book that I find the most fascinating is is it what Andrea on earth things about you that you have perspective on it and we'll where do you feel like you and I both learn something new about your story ... an example of that is just take a listen to it\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] I'm not Cracker Barrel from time to talk to you is that the contract occupy Cracker Barrel or\nIf you're just tuning in by the way this has not Saturday afternoon to the opera do I was speaking with other legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official biographer Andrew Warner above your first crush was check off\nA little girl is piano when I was by age three and I fell in love with it the way on the other kids love sports ten Barbie dolls I loved music\n[noise] and I I started playing fakes confiscated very young age but after you\nYou found something interesting in Buffy the love of took off he ran\nWell I you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be won a natural musician I'm a dead natural revision\nDo you find safety in in um sort of someone's you know hypothetical arms but isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think ... and that was sort of my assessment was that it makes sense\nThat you know a a young girl who's coming out of sort of uh some traumatic situations in her childhood would gravitate towards like a dead gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of\nThere's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we moved through as well\nAbove you is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes of heroin or these hard things to relive\nNo it wasn't hard to relive and I think but it it\nIt's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah um but ... uh you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she is a superb writer you know when we first started Andrea said you know if there's anything you don't want to talk about we just won't but and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put them on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treating them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us needs to be treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community crates compassion ... modeled ways to live and our environments um\nAnd I think that that I just think that's a that's so important I can still be a fan of your work and I'm Still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also\nI also want to see you as a real person and I think that was you know that was pretty vital to the the writing of the biography like best\nI think I think that a Shia Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy there because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the content of this\nThe songs which made me happy there because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the content of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan you know [laughter]\nI Wonder if you get the message out and Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target\n... but there there were issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs and and the way the record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just on the songs or something that comes up a lot in this book some that I didn't know about it I found really interesting you describe\nThe feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it came to your first record label on on on on vanguard you tell me a little bit more about that\n[laughter] well it was a little bit on I mean I had just gotten out of college that are going to India I was playing trying my lock it folks singing and manage village do pretty good yeah that guy records one or two signed me I went to sign with them I almost signed with Blue Note will do the jazz where it's like well by the way\nUm but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours they signed makes you a seven year to you I mean [noise]\nAnd um you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't know what to do with me they\nMany of them wanted me to where you know come up like Pocahontas infringes\nThey wanted to play that you know the most dumped them come from a real New York show business thing we got to have a gimmick [laughter] and they will and they were so they they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves or also I wasn't very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nLike in a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family all has you know they're talking about business at the table and there wasn't a lawyer in the family will judge this I'd never met any of those people\nOver ... party and go drinking after either exactly actor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of it's when you kind of you\nKnow I don't know I go home and write [laughter]\nFor me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half cocked and I don't drink at all\nUm I even unintentionally insulted some people I didn't mean to but for instance in ... there was celebrating the in the sixties and they get this four hundred year old bottle of wine and I'd say oh no thanks I don't drink and that's not cool", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29"}
