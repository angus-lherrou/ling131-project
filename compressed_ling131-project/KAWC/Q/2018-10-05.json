[noise]\nYou're not going to chew on CBC Radio one serious XM once again I\nP R I public radio international Tom power\nWelcome to the show if you're going to retell an old story particularly the kind that people cult classic you better have a pretty good reason for doing so a star is born is one of those certified classic films and you can sort of see why\nIt's like the perfect music business story it's about two people falling in love one a budding singer on her way to the top the other a legend who is say struggling and it's a story that's already been told in Hollywood three times most recently by Barbra Streisand and Chris christopherson back in Nineteen Seventy seven\nSo when Bradley Cooper decided to remake a star is born again this time with Lady Gaga doing the Barbra Streisand part he knew he had to bring something new to the table and he also smartly knew that a film about\nMusic ain't really good without well music music to monetize\nRally Cooper's singing music to my eyes I\nSong co written produced by a guy named Luke is Nelson Lucas also appears in the film because ... band you promise on the real\nWhat according to Bradley Cooper Lucas brought more than just music newest star is born he was the basis for his entire character\nYou know being the son of Willie Nelson probably help with that what apparently at all not what will you but when Bradley saw Lucas\nRally Cooper singing music to my eyes five\nLong co written produced by a guy named Luke is Nelson Lucas also appeared in the film and his ... band you promise of the real\nWhat according to Bradley Cooper Lucas brought more than just music Lewis starlet or and he was the basis for his entire character\nYou know being the son of Willie Nelson probably help with that but apparently it all ... not ... but when Bradley saw Lucas Nelson backing up meal young so I had to start by asking Lucas down just what it was that this big movie star Bradley Cooper saw in him\nLot of what he really liked was sort of the camaraderie that we had was each other and the band and that um\nYou know there were no sort of special effects Neal actually had the screen covered in burlap that was behind the stage with a with was the big burlap seed bag he covered just any had tea peas on the stage and it was just\nYeah well here's the thing that is a very very real part of any job you're going to have and you know I think there's a lot though in the music industry because\nFirst of all as artists were vulnerable by nature you know yeah and so you know\nIt's hard for us to\n... you know if somebody comes up and says I really love what you do and I want to bring that out and you just been\nYou know like for example alleys character you know she's just ... ... lake probably months you know in the timeline of the film before\nOr the the new manager comes in and says hey you know I like what you're doing ... she was working at a you know she was taken out the trash in a restaurant you know and\nIt can be almost devastatingly\nEasy to compromise who you are in order to say well I better and you know what I'm not quite sure I like this but\nI got to do it because what else am I going to do [laughter] you know I I got to play music and then maybe I can get famous and then I'll be able to do whatever I Want after that yeah 'cause all have enough money to do it yeah you know so a lot of people sort of compromise\nAnd there isn't a right or wrong on it really you know you've got to make a living you know that's the thing is that when you see somebody who is able to make a living\nAnd keep who they are yeah that's really worth the title celebrity that's when we really can celebrate somebody that's one I think it's worth it because if you see somebody out there like like Gaga like Stephanie or Bradley who's\nMade it and the successes there but the same as almost more like a symptom of the success because they're just driving their driven they want to do the best they can what they do and that is worth celebrating\nTo me and I and I will say well I Know just from playing folk music I play the traditional music from Ireland yeah when we talk about how to do it\nWe talk about artists who seemed to have maintained the right way to do this thing exactly buying a celebrity you're talking about what was your dad comes up a lot oh yeah you ... what will you know ... so many people is is the right way to do it and I I have to ask her is is does he ever talk to you about this\nIs worth celebrating to me ... and I will say well I Know but just from playing folk music I play the traditional music from Ireland yeah when we talk about\nHow to do it\nOr we talk about artists who seemed to have maintained the right way to do this thing exactly buying a celebrity you're talking about because your dad comes up a lot on your ad wars and what will you know any better but Willie Nelson as so many people is is the right way to do it and I I have to ask yeah here it just does he ever talk to you about this\nAh well yeah court sort of I mean dad and I talk about a lot of things where you know we get ... philosophical we see things I and a and I you know he's taught our family our family my mother and my father or are there do the good people and they raised is with the you know a conscience and\nAnd I think about them when I'm making decisions in life all the time if uh you know and it you know I don't think it matters though that I was a musician or what\nIt's all about staying true to who you are really life you know resisting temptation is it to the temptation to lose oneself for again like the Beatles said um gain the world and lose your soul you know um we\nWere talking about the space between us oh what's that song and the phone hide themselves the young little on the news you can never blames the truth then it's far too Lee's ...\nAs a damaged within you without you within you without you one of the more beautiful lyric Lee songs I you know I Love George Harrison too you know because George was one of those guys I mean the Beatles Paul McCartney\nDown or the people you know yeah there sure they're around a lot of famous people and there's a scene that always around people who are elevated like that in different ways but\nThey've kept you know there are about goodness they're about bringing goodness to the world and love to the world and standing for something and they have something to say like in Jackson says in the movie if you don't have something to say you're not going to have legs\nLook it's it's been great talking to you before we go I'm a star is born is I get the feeling going to influence a whole new generation of musicians what are you hoping young artist take away from watching a star is born ... I Hope that it inspires\nYoung people and old people it doesn't matter how old are you know and inspired you to want\nTo do to want to slow down and do something for yourself you know and then have something to say I think the rat race gets us all caught up in what we feel like we have to do to make ends meet and yes most of us have to\nSpend all their ... all of our time if you know making ends meet [noise]\nYou know but even still if you have a little even the hardest working of us you know in in countries where people have nothing you know they have\nArt and they have music and they bring that into their lives and they didn't riches their lives despite the haves and the haves and have nots you know in life and and I think that so no matter what you do in life if you can sort of\nFind music [laughter] you know I think you'll you'll do better things will be better look effect for talking to me to a man absolutely it was a pleasure\nYou could be Lucas Nelson playing with his band promise of the real star is born movies today backtracking also after day\nThe haves and the have the have nots you know in life and and I think that so no matter what you do in life if you can sort of find music you know I think you'll you'll do better things will be better\nLooking for talking to me it may mean absolutely it was a pleasure\nYou could look as Nelson playing with his band promise of the real in a star is born in the movie that today backtracking also after day\nOne\n\nNo no\nUh\nUh\nWe know that my knees\nAre is born ...
