for\nHear the question I'm sure every director and Hollywood has grappled with at one point or another how do you take a story that had been told many many many times\nAnd turn it into something new something gripping maybe wondered about that with so many re boots and revival hitting TV including just the other week when the latest version of star is born open in theaters and that story has already been told three times before and it with a Damien ... the Oscar winning director of la la land\nSet to uh make a film about Neil Armstrong the journey about a trip to the moon that we all know about um obviously that was going to be a really big challenge\nKnew something gripping maybe wondered about that with so many ... boots and revival hitting TV including just the other week when the latest version of star is born open in theaters and that story has already been told three times before and it with a Damien ... the Oscar winning director of la la land\nSet to uh make a film about Neil Armstrong since ... about a trip to the moon that we all know about um obviously that was going to be a really big challenge the first moon landing stories one you've probably heard about in school in history books even on TV\nSo when he took a bit of a different approach to the story with his new\nFirst men there were some mixed results in the process he left out a few details about the moon landing and that has stirred up quite a controversy here to unpack some of that\nAnd fill us in on some of the challenges of making a film like this we have gathered the cute screen panel hello to both of you I Am joined by Tina ... and John family who both write about arts and entertainment high there hadn't ... while John I'm going to turn to you first\nYou have been to the theater you watched first men and we know that this is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon but give us a little bit more contacts with the story telling us\nWell I think it was a couple of things\nThat make a distinctive the first of which is what makes these sort of early space travel expeditions seem very tense very gripping a sweat star forming on your browser watcher Neil Armstrong spacecraft bounce off the atmosphere [noise]\nAh so I think that for me was kind of the main event uh undeniably throwing in large scale on an IMAX screen or the other figure tries to do with sort of delve into a psychology a bit more by exploring his relationship with his family\nAs kind of is I think sort of a stock ... dad who was too obsessed with this mission to really care about the people around him who care about him a so those are the things that I Try to distinguish the film and if I haven't talked to my hand I think the former stuff works a lot better than [laughter]\nI Wonder if they a little bit of a clip from first men [noise]\nNeal is that why does do is just\nIn those do you have a dog then winning rooms would be [noise]\nThe last\n... years we don't feel they're\nNot going to war [noise]\nWe read\nIt has all the elements obviously the big prize the tension the drama you can hear that we attempting grand is about to happen that they're a clip from first men in theaters now and this story is one that's been told so many times Tina dispersed men add anything to the Neil Armstrong lending story [noise] I don't\nKnow about that I mean like I feel like it is trying to in dear you extremely so to Neil Armstrong's personal psychology and I actually had the reverse reaction I'm with John like\nI thought that the emotional stuff was very not very effective it was more like I knew what the film was doing and I kind of let it wash over me and I'll say they're starting to tear up near the end but I I cannot deny that it's kind of need and\nYou know I mean I've seen this story being applied in a million other kinds of stories I guess now Neil Armstrong as getting the treatment I thought that all of the suspenseful stuff where they are going up in the air\nWas a matter of fact it for me you know like ... um he recorded all or if he filmed all of this on like old film stock um all the equipment that they're using\nIs I guess supposed to be accurate so looks really ugly and it's a very dark film and I just ... I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nAnd we're honky or ... Armstrong [laughter] I don't know if I were star Ryan Gosling had there\nIt looks really ugly and it's a very dark film and I just ... I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nAnd we're honky is Neil Armstrong [laughter] I don't know if\nI were star Ryan Gosling had there's tons of close ups on him and every single twitch of his face has been captured for us to enjoy forever even if we maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong and he's\nMy cabbage debating maybe knowledge that surround sound like it's so ugly I guess I guess what the film it's trying to say like oh yeah the sixties this is what it actually\nLook like it also I think that you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been to take this rattling box up into space and and take people with\nIt there was a great moment if I may say to you and I saw the phone together theaters last week and a fellow behind us his iPhone kept going off\nA from a very amusing because you hear all the time about how uh we have more technology our pockets been was used to go to the moon so when you're actually watching the sort of rickety old spaceships a mental image or a bar and he's gotten a call from his mom or something I don't know how I found a kind of amusing for did you\nFind that the director managed to keep it interesting\nFor the most part yeah I mean there I Will say this when they get to the moon spoiler alert a and the sort of camera opens up on this broad lunar panorama I mean obviously is not real and go to the actual moon for this movie but there was like an an odd hush and the audience which is something you hear very rarely and I thought it was quite a beautiful it affecting if I miss\nIt happened to silence as well in order to deliver that and and again it ties back to Armstrong's personal story like um the the the beginning of the movie um deals with like the fact that he lost his daughter to cancer of like the daughter is extremely young so there are lots of flashbacks to that um and that carries all the way to the end of the movie\nIncluding them in landing I Want to go to a bit of a controversy that opened up over the course of the weekend for men um doesn't show Neal Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon a huge moment in history that we've all lived and relive many tires parodies of may have been made of it it's been repeated\nIt's kind of this a steady backdrop for history and that caused quite a bit of controversy online involving Florida Senator Marco Rubio and many other people have chimed in John can you unpack it for as little\nAs I said I have to be mindful of a public radio standards when I was going to fight it's so frustrating I mean this movie has American flags all over there is a huge shot of the camera going up the side of the ship it's as United States\nThese people are clearly American and everybody knows it you see the flag on the moon you just don't see it being planted so the claim that this movie somehow not patriotic enough\nAh watch why people who I presume haven't seen it a is ludicrous and I mean it just says a lot about where we are today that everybody wants to sort of make these things political\nYeah like there's just no like there isn't as much fanfare like there might have been in earlier movies about American space travel and and and I do think that really had not seen the film when he tweeted that so it's coming from a place of ignorance it\nIsn't the only commentary on it really tells you a lot of it you can have commentary like that go out and then it kind of the fires up to the point where it may have compromise Oscar possibilities for this film\nI'm so we have this claim that it's unpatriotic I'm I'm Wondering what you think about the\nThe need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the of the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding baking it that's a clear decision they must have sat at the creative table and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows all about\nIt's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life right it's not it's not a story about America getting to the moon is a story about a scientist who underway\n... what you think about the the need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the\nOf the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding baking it that's a clear decision they must have sat at the creative table and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows what was that about\nBut it's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life right it's not it's not a story about America getting to the moon is a story about a scientist who underwent extreme psychological pain and and all this stuff in his own life\nInformation and tickets available at Rio de surveys the dot com [noise]\nListening to you I'm CBC Radio one period and one of the night NPR I public radio international I throw in for our [noise]\nWell here's a question for you how many times today have you looked at your phone that is one of many films are about to hear that on the new record from Aftab\nYes we cannot say their full name on the radio but you might also remember them because they were the hard core band that won the ... music prize in two thousand nine and it probably best known for making music that sounds like this [noise]\nAre out there from asked a that was their last record glass poised released four years ago\nAnd the band unveiled their new album do your dreams and along with topics like social media and its impact on our culture the record also brings us a really different sound for the hard core band and they loved switching things out for their fans you'll hear in this one to disco their sixties pot\nBut like a lot of their previous out and you'll still find pretty hardcore punk songs in the next they haven't completely deserted who they are they're just trying a little bit of new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike how the check and ... they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story um I just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into almost the moment that they mean Abraham sat down in the kids to be a with Tom he\nAdmitted this record almost never saw the light of day once after I finished their last album he thought they might actually be done\nGlass was was really kind of the like and that and about in the end of the band I thought it was like you know certainly the end of my [noise]\nNeed to be creative in the bay and like I think last words is ultimately a compromise you know Mike came to me and he's like I Want to do this crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip down shredded park record and with with after it's impossible to get a straight up\nStraightforward hardcore record and we got lost boys which I I Do like that record I juice stand by that being like if I never write another album more the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records but like all the things that I felt I haven't said this yet I think I said the glass boys so you had to be at a period at the end of that sentence and I think so yeah oh you felt like it felt like the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think\nYou know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nJournalist tell me about the first sort of a impulse is to go into the studio after class boys the first people to do is to do to make those who drink um I Would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nI'm at and to bring in what Mike was talking about glass boys being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get that\nAmong glass boys so you had to be had a period at the end of that sentence and I think so yeah I felt like a fellow at the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think you know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nI joined it tell me about the first sort of an impulse is to go into the studio after class boys the first impulse to go to to do to make those who drink and I would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nAnd an end to bring in what Mike was talking about glass boys being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get that on paper and the idea of having to go back into the studio in turn something out creatively I\nFeel that there was a big void for us it was lucky that we always have these and\nOther projects that we can work on ... where you can sort of get ideas out of the way kind of them as though you need to over cook a few things before you get what you do get the recipe rights and\nAnd going back into does your dreams we had absolutely nothing and prepares and nothing plant so the prospect of going to the studio was kind of the same as sitting at home where you where did you wouldn't go into the studio at all but just judging by what Damien just said ah I actually I didn't have that worry and\nNot to try and take the the rug out of what was the main thing about it as the creativity in what he needed to say I just always assumed that there's going to be some project that up is going to endeavor to be a part of this in the studio\nReally became a tool for us real conduit for and songwriting ... became an instrument almost and some somewhere between glass boys and and does your dream so I just assumed it would be there to tell you the truth I had no idea in what way but ... I Can't\nGet over the range of of genres on his right hand he really even like to talk about genres that much but I I Do hear like like I mean we heard it but it's like sort of disco and under your dreams it's pop it's it's hard core it's just like do up tendencies on this\nMike what was the intention to try out a bunch of different genres or was it just things were coming to you and you wanted to put them out in the way they were they were coming in your head [noise]\nYeah like we were really writing an album we just had it was sort of like we had studio time we were just writing music and it wasn't until like a year later that\nThe songs we got sort of coalesce into a fully realized thing so I think me and Jonah just spent so much time together and every one of the band is into so many different kinds of music and sort of like scholars of music that we just had a lot in there we want it to sort of flex and just see what kind of stuff we could make\nAnd it wasn't until a lot later that those songs started becoming a ...\nA game in ... as we kind of pointed out from talking to Mike and joined us if you weren't there for all of this what was your reaction when the songs that brought the uh well they are like kind of three stages I'm Jonah was there for the first stage of 'em I got brought the song we're we download a couple of yet we definitely other versions of some of some of the song um\nAnd it was one of those things where you know like I forget which one it was and I I remember being in there and being like I'm not how can I write to this I was also limits them kind of producing and and and hosting this wrestling TV show ah so I was travelling like all the time really focused on that and the and it was just so\nDifferent you know and it was just so different ... different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with trying to write the way I write to\nThose songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we've got a couple we've gotta beside out of it and like the\nOr five days and the leaders are writing were really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to some it was before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing and trying different things out and uh I I just couldn't really find it\nFor now different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with trying to write the way I write\nTo those songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we've got a couple we've gotta beside out of it and we were like the four\nOr five days and the leaders are writing were really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to some it was before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing and trying different things out\nAnd uh I I just couldn't really find it and I remember going to Mike and being like I don't I don't I don't know like it wasn't really working and uh then my came back and said I wrote everything and that at first was like you know my natural reaction was like Wal Mart saying everything you wrote like I'll eventually run my own songs and then\nYou know he just kind of had it all figured out you know he had this whole kind of plan in place and so for the first time instead of being like well how do I fit into your plan I was like which is something that I think Jonah has done a long time in the band been like how do I eat this plan\nIn it coming to fruition and Jones did that for me when I was writing songs with the ban certainly doesn't for Mike and so that's what I decided I was going to try and do this record you know yes and it's that hard I simply hard like I think I think it's hard to put your ego in check\nFor for anything you know and especially in a band especially being a lead singer in a band I remember Gore told me one time like ... square down towards counties are those like the worst name dropping ... Downie said too said to me one time there's like a a lead singer is where it differently\nYou know like in the lead singer you have to take in\nAll this energy and that's positive and negative and I think you do that night in a night out you do that every time you write a record and that's that's training and you know as a lead singer\nYou have to have this ego defense that's up in place I on ending empathy for you know people milling music but do silly things non criminal horrible things I should but stuff's five but like people that do and say\nDum dum Saddam saying yeah yeah because I think it's just like it does tickle your mind eventually being in in a band but\nI Want I Want to talk more about the record or you're just tuning into speaking with ... Damien making Jonah from messed up about does your dreams keep pay a little bit from the record than [noise]\nAt least if Welsh singer called Nigel ... good good to know [laughter]\nNo like you know we do the view that lived that got him\nI tell you what that's easy that part\nI Want to take a page from the Sloan book at that point and I want to do like a switch ruined were you play drums or something like that oh God if I did that there'll be no matter what you do that we\nWe used to cover and all the New York ... sort of our punk song and dance and got drunk and I got and guitar I Would say huge success but see you again\nI think the thing about drums that I really unique approach to it like most people think that it should be the rhythm of the band I think it should be able to sleep free for\nMike I'm this is this is a a an album that has a a narrative arc um I I Know this is a radio show and we don't have a all the time in the military can you can use to simply summarized the narrative arc for me it's just about\nA guy who has problems in his life and he\nUm finds the help of a homeless shelter ... elderly woman to to help him\nAnd then he finds release at the end of the record what do you find useful about telling the stories of the character as opposed to say first person narratives [noise] well I realize later that the record is about me and my journey of being in a band and really humming okay with being a weird person\nWe don't have a all the time in the military can you can use to simply summarized the narrative arc for me it's just about a guy\nWho has problems in his life and he um finds the help of a homeless shelter ... elderly woman to to help him and then he finds release at the end of the record\nWhat do you find useful about telling the stories of a character as opposed to say first person narratives [noise] well\nI realize later that the record is about me and my journey of being in a band and really humming okay with being a weird person in a weird band it's so weird life and it's your you know living up in opposition to most of the people you see on the street every day three days later on this record was about me becoming okay with my own life you know\nSo that you are using a care you are in trouble you you were just kind of guide said making ... takes office talk of his life a little bit yeah\nAnd using a character let's I mean I realize later what the what I was even writing about something using a character lets you think of sort of your own life in a more objective way to write about truth really maybe", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "15"}
