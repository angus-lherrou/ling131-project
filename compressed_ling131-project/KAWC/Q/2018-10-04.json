Riley and the sisters brothers they play to guns for hire in the Old West\nThese two characters that is the worst southern accent in the world by the way the two characters come to you directly from the imagination of a guy named Patrick to wed\nBacked away to the Canadian author who wrote a novel the sisters brothers back in twenty eleven it was one of those big instant hits it when the governor general ward and the writers trust award and made the short list for the man Booker and the ... bank killer prize which is kind of like\nThe ah Grammy's and Juno's\nOf literature and that's about as good as the get for a novelist in this country and this was only Patrick deWitt second book all that attention was pretty new to him that I mean this is a guy who before he was a writer with a high school dropout he was a bartender he was a house painter well\nFast forward a few years and you should be starting to get used to the spotlight not only does the sisters brothers hit theaters tomorrow Patrick ... new novel French Exit just got short listed for this year's Geller prize so when we talked I had to start out with some congratulations\nPatrick welcome to Q. congrats on the nomination\nOh thanks very much feels like a good week to be you man\n[laughter] um and yeah I I I have no complaints things are going well with a new book well\nAnd also the sisters brothers movie opens this weekend is it true that the whole idea for this story began with two words you wrote in your notebook sensitive cowboys\nThat was the very start yeah and that just um resulted in a in some dialogue between two men on horseback it occurred to me I mean growing up with my father I watched any number of westerns with them but I was watching I Believe it was one of the spaghetti westerns and I think it was leave increase Russo just stylish villain in some of these films\nAnd I begin to wonder you know where does he shot or does it where does this man by his Cape and and and uh it occurred to me that the interior lives of the characters of westerns and soft and obscured so I think that was sort of a where the sensitive part came in you know what what makes these men tick was the question\nAnd I went um because of these emails they talked me into it and I was so pleased that they had because it was very moving actually to see all of this industry and all of these professionals working towards the similar goal which was to recreate a book that I made up in my pajamas you know\nOther than that and then again this is something they can have your imagination in your pajamas did you get to walk around you get to like you don't touch in an experience that place that you came up with in your mind [noise]\nWell I did yeah and that was just so so strange and wonderful that I could do this um this was really expensive and there was all these sort of dead areas where there were no actors are cameras but they\nThey dressed it just in case they used it so I was sort of walking to these empty bar rooms and I'm saloons and and and um [noise]\nYou know stores where people were selling horses or whatever it was and it was very elaborate and labyrinth thing and thorough and just a you know what what a treat this was for me and how and how strange to get to experience\nAt the trap it really it really would not not not to use non ZV the language here but what a trip that must have been it really was yeah uh so you've written already written a screenplay for your new novel for French Exit why did you learn from this adaptation of this down the sisters brothers that you can take with you as you make more stories\nInto films [noise] right I don't know that it'll necessarily influenced the way I rights I think that my we're generally lends itself to screen play because of the amount of dialogue and so much of the story and the character um\n... writes I think that might work generally lends itself to screen play because of the amount of dialogue and so much the story and the character um progression zone revealed through the things that they say or or don't say [noise]\nBut um I learned through this how difficult it is to make a sizeable picture I mean John had this property and his possession before the book was\nPublished I think maybe before it was\nProperly accepted even so this is eight years ago and he's been working tirelessly ... and to to to realize this film and it's taken them this long um it's just the um [noise]\nAs far simpler to write books you know I mean writing books has its own set of problems but you just sit down and do it you know but they're collaborative nature of film is something that I was just really impressed by how much\nUm discussion and and um how many people are involved in the making of a film so I was humbled buy it in a way it also made me appreciate my own focus um fourth relatives simplicity but it also you know I mean seeing I'm\nSeeing the sisters brothers film and enjoying it as much as I did it made me keen to do it again you know right so\nI think um\nIt was the best case scenario and then I think I could have come out of his experience thinking well I don't want to do that again but in fact I feel just the opposite so\nSo you mentioned that French acted as a discussion painkiller congratulations again by the way Oh thanks very much how do you find out your shortlist as you get ... phone calls and email\nWell ... was there was an email but I don't have email at home so I didn't get the email till that afternoon and my friend ... who um will direct French acts that she actually called me and he assumed I knew but he was wanting to tell me [noise]\nSo that was nice but then ... ... moment after my father called him he was at the airport I'm heading actually to Paris himself\nAnd he said in his typically ... said well you made the shortlist you kiss ass [laughter]\nUh you know ... you've been ... big awards before and and you've been asked about winning awards before um I I Hope I Hope you take this in the way ... demand but the sisters brothers was short listed for the ... it it didn't when\nI Do want to ask you because we never hear this perspective what is it like to be up for a huge prize and and not take it home\nYeah well I think the experience with ... and then with the book or as well um my feeling with with these two prizes as if you've made it to the short list then there's the sense that you have one already and I don't really have that hyper competitive spirit that\nI'm sure there are some authors who get to this point and then if they don't when they're disappointed or angry or or there's some you know negative response and we're supposed to learn the book read and feel that at all [noise] um\nIt's it's a natural feeling to want to take it to the very end but it doesn't override the you know that sort of wonder and and and the brilliance of just being there and the first place so I have a feeling of being pleased that it's on the short list and I'm not really worrying about what comes next\n... would've been nice talking to you know use well thank you I'll see you at the at the Gaylor I'll be I'll be at the table excellent\nYou can see the sisters brothers in theaters from tomorrow and you can pick up a copy of French ... which is Patrick ... make ... short listed novel right now by the way the

undergoing a mass shooting\nSo how do you write about that\nAnd some are also right at the vet cellar\nWith Jodie Pico have an answer to that and she also\nEveryone who's going to have questions about her new book and you're going to hear her answer them right after right after this [noise]\n\nMost Republican voters support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite sexual assault allegations

as I say I'm One sixty nine Hannah\nPublic radio international\nBack to the show\nShe was the b._b._c. radio one serious I Am one\n... radio international\nBack to the show [noise] when you pick up a novel why does it that you hope to find I'm willing to bet that even if you like escaping into another galaxy or some moment way back in time your favorite work of fiction still probably has something to say about the real world\nTextbook like uncle Tom's cabin or The Handmaid's tale these are novels that forced readers to look at the world around them I really consider how far we've come in history and where we could be headed\nRight now in the U.S the investigation of judge Brett Kavanaugh is unfolding with all the plot twist of a political thriller and people are so invested in the story because the stakes are so high\nA lot of people say that if Kavanaugh become the Supreme Court judge the highest court in the land could overturn roe v Wade women could lose legal access to abortion\nTo some that will be an incredible victory to others and unimaginable laws\nSo that raging in the background a new novel hit bookstores this week it's about a shooting at a reproductive health clinic the last place in Mississippi where a woman can get an abortion\nIt's called a spark of light and it's the new novel from Jodi Pico one of the best selling author is around right now\nJody joins me from New York City to tell me more about it I Jody high and your author's note at the end of the book which is really as a as a resting as any other part of the book you write laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray tell me more about that\n[noise] that's actually why I wrote the book when I was in college I had a really good friend who had seven weeks pregnant or unwanted pregnancy\nVery upset and she and her boyfriend had many tearful nights and finally decided to get an abortion and I supported her a hundred percent\nYears later I was pregnant with my third child I was seven weeks pregnant and there was a complication and when I went to the doctor that said to me well you know either it's going to stick or it's not and I was devastated because to me that was already a baby and I couldn't figure out how I could hold both of those things in my mind\nThat two seven week pregnancies you know one would be okay to go and have an abortion the other one to me it was already a baby that I wanted\nAnd that to me made me think really hard I think how we define ourselves is not just a matter of whether we think we fall into a pro life or pro choice camp I think that for the same woman over the course of one lifetime you may sway little\nWhere do you find yourself right now\nI Am very strongly pro choice\nYou talk to people all sides of this debate in your book what do you think people in the pro choice side might get wrong about people on the pro life side\nExactly what I did frankly you know I went into my interviews with people who are pro life making assumptions that were dead wrong\nI thought that these people were crazy religious zealots\nAnd what I found was that the people I spoke with were really nice people and they were people I Would have been friends with I Would have gone out to dinner with them we had tons of things in common we just didn't happen to agree on this one issue and people who are pro life the vast majority come from a place of deep compassion and deep convictions\nAnd what about the other side did you find the right thing to pro lifers or people in the pro life side you know about people in the pro choice either perhaps they should\nYes people assume that women who have abortion or using it as birth control that is a flat out lie no woman and I talked to a hundred and fifty one of them goes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is emotionally draining it takes a lot of time\nFifty one of them goes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is emotionally draining it takes a lot of time and a lot of money I I should\nSay for people who haven't haven't read the book that when you read this book you you you don't just get the perspective of people who were at an abortion coming to get an abortion you could read through no no no you get the respect of the of of of the doctors working to get the perspective of anti abortion protesters Jodie is it hard to write with empathy about a character with whom you strongly disagree\n[noise] I think it's my job to do that\nI Do not believe that as a writer it's my job to tell a reader what to think\nBut I Do think it's my job to present very fairly all sides of a situation lay out all the arguments so that as you're reading you can go through them and figure out why you believe what you believe you may change your mind you may not\nAnd yet I bet it may be the first time you've ever really listen to what someone and opposition has to say yeah you know we we tend when we know someone doesn't believe what we believe we tend to immediately judge them particularly in my country right now which is really broken and where people are on great divides\nWe've got to figure out how to have conversations and just listen\nJody go in her new book spark of like the story unfolds during a mass shooting a hostage taking out a women's health clinic in Mississippi one called the center I'm you spend a lot of time in clinics like the one in the story in this book\nOne of the people who work in these places tells you about their experiences and their fears about the kind of violence that you describe in this book\n[noise] so it's it's really fascinating and and frightening ... even in a city like Boston where a abortions are readily available and there are lots of clinics um when you go in there are guards and security and metal detectors and uh it feels like you're walking into a prison\nIn the deep south it's very different because although they also have security measures there is a gauntlet of protesters that you have to walk through just to get into the doors of the clinic\nI mean that's a lot emotionally that's a lot and if you are there to get an abortion that's also a lot 'cause you've you've really struggled believe me to come to that decision nobody makes it lightly but also the doctors who wear bullet vests to the class I mean I'm sure this is really saw\nYes and it's interesting I did a lot of work with a man named Dr Willie Parker who is the basis for Dr ward in the book willy is a remarkable man I Love him he", "show_name": "Q",
