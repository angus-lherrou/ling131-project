college a lot of people don't talk about him but he is a a Korean American comedian or from Knoxville, Tennessee who is gossip an accent is really funny\nAnd you'd be he was on Jay Leno a lot I remember he was a big influence and then obviously Margaret Cho was really the pioneer into this to this day she is still like\nThe the I don't know she is kind of the godmother of contemporary Asian\nAmerican Asian Canadian comedy she really is just kind of the reason we're all here looks like the next clip pick them up at the\nThey had a real problem with me because I look at trade I talked to track [noise]\nAnd it's like a problem and that kind of sensitive about it they're like Margaret we don't want you to take the wrong way that could you be a little bit more oh I don't know [noise]\nWell actually I'm Korean [noise] whatever [noise]\nOn the show and how it is\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] that is kind of\nThe algorithm of every Asian American ... you know comic as when you start

about the expectations put on her yeah and as well yes it's all about expectations is all about\nYou know I mean and I even in my own act I do\n[noise] that is\nKind of the outer rhythm of every Asian

V. but then when you became a thing on average like in ... like they find it takes middle school\nAnd like I knew that was I wanted to do because it's just so festival to drop out of school right to yeah I got that uh I did a semester where a auto you for marketing up cool yeah uh but then my ... channel is blowing up and I decided I wanted to focus on that so I decided to take a semester off yeah\nAnd I haven't gone back how did you how did that go with your folks both of them were like shocked at first um because I was I was a academically driven and but um my mom was very supportive she says whatever you want to do\nUm and my dad was just a little concerned for Shea um but now he totally understand that they cause he just didn't understand like the holy to both in that well yeah I mean with your parents were ... they there was no YouTube now so to them it probably does seem like staring into a camera\nFrom the older generations perspective obviously I understand what it looks like it looks like just someone making little videos on line yeah but so much more than that this the\nOn social media world has become a whole different thing is in St Louis so tell me like how long does it take to make videos than the ones I figure like between for sick sometimes eight ten minutes how long do they take you to make [noise]\nI'd say a solid week of fake straight work so like every day every hour I'm liking to a week it's become a huge production at this point yeah I just keep I keep raising the bar\nI understand what it looks like it looks like just someone making little videos on line yeah but so much more than that this the on social media world has become a whole different thing it's just insane now\nAre so tell me about how long does it take to make videos when the ones I figure like between for sick sometimes eight ten minutes I wanted to they take it to me [noise]\nI'd say a solid week of like straight work so like every day every hour I'm working for a week it's become a huge production at this point yeah I just keep I keep raising the bar and just keeps getting bigger and bigger and\nPart of this is is getting so much of yourself in this to you you're gonna conscious decision that you wanted to reveal a lot of yourself and that's yeah I I I\nI just found my life I don't know if this is narcissistic today but I found my life a interest [laughter]\nI just find that\nIt's not me it's the people in my life I find them fascinating they're all such characters to me and I find that in any person you meet you could turn them into\nA character I like the idea of like showcasing that because I found my family's specially very interesting and they're very relatable but also just so unique like you've never seen them like that\nBefore you ... with some of the most personal things a person can view if you talk about in these videos could play one to go into the\n[laughter] humans are so strong to redress figure that out is Ronald Levy on your first person I came out and I had known for Fifteen sons\nWent out and I might have had a little too much to drink worse than I was trying to pull me aside and I told him that need homes who are who you are your feelings are much more of something so I went back to Ottawa in day\nOut you know [noise]\nI Know you should have been distances they came back home in September [noise] now you know why\nThe future but he would almost four million views are by news outlets all over the world of view [noise]\nComing out yeah me coming out that that he has a video of me crying and my dad was for a very odd that adds only for a million is how do you decide to live but let's start with how do you decide that this is how you want to come out\n[noise] I'm just so bad it being vulnerable which is surprising if you look at my age of channel but I'm very bad to being vulnerable in person\nSo I find being vulnerable on camera is kind of a loophole to that because when I'm being vulnerable\nSure is being showcased to millions of people but at the moment in at the time of me being vulnerable I'm by myself with a camera so I'm like catching the system I'm being able to being vulnerable without having to be vulnerable to put a loophole yeah love it\nTell me about the moment you made that decision though to do that do you remember was there a time of their space where you somewhere you're at a table in the back of a car like when did you decide I was going to make this video\nIt's when I decided it's one I figured out I was bisexual I was like okay now I Need to tell people because it was something that's been like\nA like a weight on my shoulders for a long time and I as keeping a secret and I know I knew my my mom would that especially she knew I was hiding something from it so I knew it was time to just kind of like really sad pressure and so I just thought\nIt was like I thought making the video will be like killing a ton of birds with one stone like I Would not to sit down every friend and sit down every family member and tell them how to do that you didn't tell personally feel about that [noise]\nYeah I I realized after there is that you owe them a no no no there's some people like I didn't tell my sisters\nI just found out through video because they were raised very religious they are very religious Christian folk yes exactly until they're ... obscene very upset by that are um they shouldn't find out what the rest of the world they should find out oh just maybe a few seconds\nI thought making the video will be like killing a ton of birds with one stone like I Would not to sit down every friend and sit down every family member and tell them how to build you didn't tell personally feel about that [noise]\nYeah I I realized after there is that you owe them a no no no there's some people like I didn't tell my sisters\nI just found out through video because they were raised very religious they are very religious Christian folk yes exactly until they're ... obscene they upset by that um they shouldn't find out what the rest of the world\nThey should find out oh just maybe a few seconds beforehand\nBut I get it yeah I I I I learned from that experience so the ... after that you start getting thousands and thousands of more people subscribing to YouTube channel do something you noticed yeah that that come into video blew up like nothing I've ever seen before it changed the videos than you were making afterwards\nIt changed in the sense that I I started putting a lot of pressure on how good the videos like because I felt like a lot of the ... the ... video blew up because there was like\nA you know I came out and everyone's just trying to be supportive but I think a lot of it was they they were intrigued by the storytelling and how I made the actual video itself\nAnd so I was like really worried that the next video is not as good or something so that to a change really but it wasn't like oh I Need to give way more myself now know a little bit ... right after the command video I was like okay I Need to do more and he'd go bigger\nAnd and you can play another clip yeah how did you go with\nMe in on the little known Stanley looks must be ... over
