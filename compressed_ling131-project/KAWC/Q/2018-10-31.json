of working class London Michael Caine was an entirely new breed of actor when he hit it big in the early sixties with his trademark Hockney accent timeless school Michael Caine is still a force to be reckoned with well into his eighties he's\nA sixth time Oscar nominee he's won twice for his role when Hannah and her sisters that again for the cider house rules you might have seen him in more recent years in Christopher Nolan films like\nThe dark Knight inception interstellar but you might know him best from it earlier hits like ... feet and get Carter are educating read it in his new book sir Michael Caine shares a lot of the lessons he's learned over the years on film sets in in life just generally and of course his new book is called\nBlowing the bloody doors off Michael Caine joined me from a studio in London sir Michael Caine welcome to Q.\nThank you very much violence of blowing the buddy doors off is a book full of advice and some of it is from you directly some of it as advice he received over the years can you tell me about the advice you got from John Wayne when you ran into him at the Beverly Hills hotel\nUh yeah yeah he I I just played out for you and I was in and uh in in Hollywood in Beverly Hills hotel\nOr when nothing to do I was going to do a movie we surely be planted she was late coming down and I didn't know anybody so he's just sit in the ... looking for movies cost us ... and he was registering in the hotel he looks out to be said to be what's your name could\nI said Mike okay and he said even a movie out the ... and he said you're going

... malaria came out of hospitals than looking haggard way the way they are a very strong company accent\nAnd I became an act to not to become rich in five minutes I became an act to knowing that I Would never be rich in five minutes it was obvious you couldn't do it you couldn't make it yeah it may I couldn't do it I became it to be the best I could possibly be or something I wanted to do which would be an actor\nAnd that's all I ever did and I only had to compare myself to my last performance I didn't compare myself to other people because they will will always be better because of me and ...\nAnd and and the point I wanted to get across the young people Bush was to go ahead and do what you want to do and find will take its course if you gotta you gotta if you haven't you didn't have any way\nWhy why did you want to do it even though you knew that even though you knew that it would be such a struggle\n[noise] well it's because I enjoy doing it obviously and I have a direct to when I was younger before I went in the um being a youth club I was an advertiser eye to eye Neal tentative wish to work in a factory yeah\nI'd I first became an actor I was working in a factory packing better but fame never occurred to me over to ever come to me was to be as good as I possibly could be a what I chosen to do which I thought was a lesson\nAnd and that idea of persistence or Michael is is is what gets me is even when one of my favorite stories and the book is Christopher Nolan comes to you approaching it by playing Alfred the butler in in the dark night he was pretty persistent to right\nOh yeah I've been one Sunday Morning and I was walking past the front door my house in the country which has claws\nAnd last I saw this man standing there with a script in his hand and I said the door to him and he came in and I didn't know who he was until you say these films that have done indeed done three of the great films are saying and he said he was Christopher Nolan and I said well what what what what what what you want me to do some disco Batman Begins\nSuffer or ... or ... a Batman film such as Batman said oh I ... I was thinking to myself well I'm I'm too old to fly by a man who am I going to be about going to be to butler [noise]\nSo I said what do you want me to play\nYou said the butler [laughter] so I said oh really I said well what a Web site at dinner is served would you like another class of red wine or ... what do I say he said no he said Michael estate for them that he said the butler was by man's foster father when his father died\nAnd then he said when you read the script said you said or does he live there and made them in the country in England\nI said my driver bringing it to you in the morning he said no I Want you to read it now I'm taking it with me I didn't realize what I Know now Chris is very secretive about everything that he did\nSo I went and he had a cup of tea with my wife in the kitchen and I read it fell in love with it and came out and said yes oh wow and that's how I got Batman has started my whole new life\nAs an old man is an old I [laughter] I've enjoyed as much as being a young actor but I'd say it's more the story of how Christopher Nolan got you like again like I don't think it's [laughter]\nWell he he regarded me as a lucky ... kept saying no it's it's the other way around as you all my life your job I mean I've been so lucky we are never made a ... movie\n[laughter] and ah Michael Cain and blowing the doors off you're right about how comedians love

you can bring that reality to your performances and we talked about that we talked about acting on on the inside but I I Want to know someone who's been watching people carefully for decades now\nDo you see something new and different in the way people act now or is it basically the same as it was decades ago\nOh no it it just changed everybody's a much more free now in the way they do things um

you live in LA but oh my God all of your experiences on\nOur own ways their own ways and uh I was flipping through stations and it was again kiss I found when\nI heard it and you know like your initial issue it was issued yeah your initial reaction to something like that is to turn to the person next to you and I was definitely alone and I did that at all the you\nKnow like freaked out of who you mentioned you were in Nineteen when when the fifth when you had that moment with your writing songs before that summer and I don't think a lot of people talk about this 'cause it's kind of the boring side of it takes a lot of discipline it takes a lot of like hours sometimes eight nine yeah Thirteen hours at a time\nSitting down and and and writing that's not something that sort of discipline is not something that normally contributed to people who are Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen years old well\nI was home schooled route yeah so I had a lot of time to any reason um you know not really what you want to talk about them in order to get to know I'm I'm I'm an open book all talking about anything I'm\nNo uh I just I wanted to do music rent and um my sister had like a kind of a\nBad time in middle school and I just was like I don't really want to do that right ah I loved it uh I I mean I got to write all the time and and just like figure out who I was as a person rather than who I was around everybody else so\nDo you think that's where the discipline came from that or do you have to do that ability to put in twelve Thirteen hours definitely painstaking often sigh\nRiding doesn't doesn't take that long for me though that sounds that sounds like work writing is fun even even if it's a vulnerable song it's still fun 'cause you're getting all these things out of your body but\nThere you go in for a session with someone you've never met before I Know that happened some yeah some will sit down with you I I Know there's a there's a period where you have to get to know one another for yeah talk about those insecurities talk yeah those Boehner abilities but it doesn't take twelve hour ...\nIt takes maybe like an hour or two we talk openly have lunch we hang out I usually am with my co writer Justin surrender yeah so we you know we've been doing this for a long time the other five years coming up in September\nSo you know he's he's he'll he'll talk

just how became about but a little bit about them should decide to do because this is a song or that we played on the show more than any other song last year he was our song\nOf the year on cue
