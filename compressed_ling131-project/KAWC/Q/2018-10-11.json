listen to this\nConclusion about love love anybody here dark and you saw some do something now and I love going to do is just one of those things to smoking it makes anything you can you can sort of that on\nTop of of you were going to make a very simple melted change because you know what's in here [noise] I don't know what I make this thing never watch a pot of water because it's never going to

think it shows a different side of Matty than maybe you're used to seeing but we're going to find that many Matheson is sitting across the table for me right now in Studio\n... how are ya I'm well tell me about your grandfather\nA grand Matheson yeah my dad so grainy Matheson are incredible both of my like just a really are the most like Canadian family kind of like my my dad grew up up in like um [noise] I've been yellow knife and my grandfather was RC\nAnd that you can sit in a bathtub any macaroni and cheese if you want and you can still be serious and care about things and make beautiful things like just because I can make a good macaroni and cheese with like Cheetos on top\nDoesn't mean that I Can't make the most beautiful cat to lay or roasted chicken or serve just beautiful food and I think like that is I'm now ... like this book is me\nRight like it's not vice isn't it even like with me making this book with Abrams they allowed me to make ... ... ... ... yeah Aaron's is the publisher and they've been amazing to work with like that book is my proposal\nWhich is an amazing thing like I stayed the course I went in with a very strong proposal and I was like this is the book I'm selling [laughter] this is the book that I Want to make\nA if you want to do this book than we can do it yeah I mean the very first line of the book is um this cookbook is not about farms gardens sustainable\nSeafood or how much cocaine I did before or after service every night and I think it's pretty well documented you struggled with addiction yeah attack when you were twenty nine you have to use the drugs and alcohol like is is this book is changing what people think about when they think about you\nI think it's just going to add another layer yeah you know I was just going to be like oh sick like I used to love reading like um ... books and like these auto biography like you know these books about these\nAmazing funny characters that are pretty tragic getting booted up booted out of ... lots of no serious lots of beer here it's lots of ... and and I I just\nI had an opportunity to just how much real like my story there's no there's no um me trying to ... like I I could easily right all of the horror stories and all of the um [noise] kinda nightmares that I went through but I think it's more\nIt it it's better for everyone if I kind of just write about food and a little bit of the nightmares and a little bit of like the excess because I think that like\n... it's just true to who I knew this book is just really true it's hard to even describe it but as it is just true to me\nI think a reading this book the way you talk about your family's food is really interesting to me a lot of the recipes in in this book Matty are yeah it's like half and half yeah but the the family recipes a lot of stuff I grew up with two ... everyone freaking out about your ... was affecting me because I Love ... a lot of cups yeah but it's quickly turning into the bologna cop\nIs quickly turning into the cheeseburger for main already because like I said like a bunch of ... and everyone's talking about the bologna cop and I made this beautiful but they're gonna microwave baloney ... I'm not going to dominate divorce rates\nIt's hard to even describe it but as it is just true to me I think a reading this book the way you talk about your family's food is really interesting to me a lot of the recipes in in this book Matty are yeah it's like split half and half\nYeah but the the the family recipes about stuff I grew up with to everyone freaking out about your ... offending me because I Love ... cops yeah but it's quickly turning into the bologna cop\nIs quickly turning into the cheeseburger for main already because like I said I got a bunch of ... and everyone's talking about the bologna cop and I made this beautiful book microwave baloney ... I'm not going to die but it's it's fine yeah because as soon as he gets a book they open it up\nAnd it's happening like as soon as somebody opens up that book like\nThis isn't what I expected this is a beautiful cookbook and that's what all I wanted to do I wanted to make a cookbook that are like really like books that really truly inspired me\nSo if you're you have a kid right yeah so if you're a kid was to write like the next ... of the recipes that were passed down to ... ... what would be in it [noise]\nI don't know ... like free and chicken fingers every day I don't know like I like what

really basic like Japanese ... some some some or chicken some rice some some uh boiled rutabagas or in some die on any like just jams at a bunch of like really nice rice and like if you give him a bra

every morning like\nSeven AM as soon as I wake up like if I could just have ... and just smash up off our guy every day that would be the greatest thing in my life but I think Mac is like still young two and a half\nI Know but I have a feeling that food is something you guys pat down to one another I Hope so like I I Want like I even wrote that stupid cliched thing about like now I'm setting the

listening to chew on CBC Radio one serious acts and when the nine and the R I or public radio international\nMy name is Tom power\nCouple of weeks ago on the show you might've heard Maggie Gyllenhaal telling you a bit about her latest film if you missed it she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival where her new movie the kindergarten teacher\nWas having a premier so when he was sitting here in the studio as you might have guessed from last block of the show we ended up talking for a very very long time\nWe couldn't actually fit the whole conversation into the show the weeks ago so I'm excited for you to hear the second chapter of our interview now the ... film is about to hit Netflix don't worry you can pick it up here 'cause we're gonna talk about a new film to kindergarten teacher which takes you into the classroom of happy five year olds\nAre but it has a pretty dark side to it as well Maggie Gyllenhaal character is this teacher will end up taking things too far with one of her young students not not like that what that means issue becomes quite obsessed with unlocking the secret of a little boys poetry\nThe film ends up being a psychological thriller but also side it was sort of a black comedy as well you'll hear Maggie Gyllenhaal dig into more of this unbelievable story and just admitted including how she helped pull this film together on a set full of five year olds\nMaggie Gyllenhaal nice to have you here thanks for having me so I'm a poem is at the heart of this film you play a kindergarten teacher aspiring poet and one of your students says these words out of the blue and that kind of the moment that's that's the whole story in the play Anna is beautiful beautiful enough for me\nThe sun hits Harry yellow house it's almost like a gift from God like a ... like a sign from God\nJust something about watching a child say a poem or even just actually hearing us say home reminds me of how strange it can be and how little we hear poetry in our daily lives\nI think that's true but I think children you know ... kind of a poetic world I mean that's part of an interesting about the movie is yes the child\nAnd they said too late to look at it either that this child had some kind of gift and out of hand calms things fully formed pond or they just kind of more of the way I look at it\nThat you know it's about a woman who is a poet who's poetry isn't heard and certainly not appreciated who\nInterpret sled she's seeing coming out of the child as ... as\nBeing she needs them to be polymer because she needs because she's starving right\nAnd I also think you know and the way they think well okay so how do you tell that story and I just keep thinking about the interview I did with them with Trevor Noah from the Daily Show yeah it was about to do but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher and as hell I'm\nHe was asking me about it and he was like\nSell it higher movie yeah is it a thriller\nBut she's seeing coming out of a child as poems\nBecause she needs them to be poems because she needs because she's starving right\nAnd I also think you know in a way they think well okay so how do you tell that story and I just keep thinking about the interview I did with them with Trevor Noah from the Daily Show yeah it was about the Deuce but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher and her so um\nHe was asking me about it and he was like\nSo is it a horror movie yeah is it a thriller yeah is it an intimate movie about a woman's mind you know and I think um\nI loved that that he said that because\nThe truth is it's it's none of those things and all of those things because even the kind of funny sometimes it's a new form and I think it's partially partially new\nBecause it's feminine it's coming from a feminine place what\nDo you think the film says about the value we put on ours as a society [noise]\nI think one of the things that's compelling to me is like well who decides who decides what's valuable who decides that leases poetry is less valuable than the poetry of this on a boy and I think that's really interesting right\nBut I think also it's interesting to think about the value the sheep places on earth herself ...\nYou know until he was really repeating after us and doing something very very technical and simple yeah\nUm and then and then I think in terms of me acting with him\nIt's funny it's like Lisa thinks she's having a relationship with Jimmy but she's having a relationship with herself\nAnd I think she's missing him and so\nIt was All right that I didn't have like a deeply intimate relationship with this little boy it was just really more about a conversation with myself\nI feel like a risky film to you I mean you have a child is key rural very complex lead character that you don't really know whether you're rooting for even when the phone was over right entirely sure of average in August do this film and feel to risk at all when you were making up\nYeah I mean of course of course of course but like wild are we doing it you know and when I sat in the audience in Sundance and I felt\nThis kind of a while the fact that it has I mean you can imagine that gets people gas and they laugh that strange things were and\nI think it's saying something real about the state of the world for women at the moment I'm\nThis is a woman who is not fundamentally mentally ill should not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in [noise]\nAnd I think for many women at the moment if we're honest I don't I don't know that I could imagine doing the things that Lisa does I mean it's an allegory she goes real far\nReally extreme I really don't want to do more notice is that there's lots of it that are very not related books\nNo well right if it's beyond a normal behavior of north but up until the point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no help no one understands\nHer um and I think is hungry for some kind of real interaction in the world um is something I really relate to and I know because of what the cultural conversation at the moment that half of\nYou know the people in the world the women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last summer\nTrump was elected in New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of like deep radicalism mixed with Malaysia\nKind of real interaction in the world\nUm is something I really relate to and I know because of what the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the people in the world the women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last summer Trump was elected\nIn New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of\nLike the\nRadicalism mixed with Malaysia\nSo there were protests people were spray painting things on Trump's buildings there were it was there were there was a ruptured the protest in the street and then there was also a certain amount of [noise] or is it that's what happens\nWe'll know there was a certain amount of oh my God look where we actually are yeah this is not where we wish we were ... and\nYeah I think when you I think what started off all of this and the time's up and everything I Believe was Trump saying\nYou can grab one if you want to and you have enough power and they let you mhm and then there being no consequences for it and I think for for me I was like well how\nThings are bad and I looked at in my life and I looked at the ways in which I had accepted all sorts of things I couldn't believe I accepted and um and I think that's sort of what it's about I mean I Do think it's about\nThe real consequences of what happens if you starve a vibrant woman's mind and I think so many women right now are waking up to\nThe feeling that we've been starving that we've been accepting so many things bending over backwards twisting ourselves into pretzels to get the things that we need to survive and that it's not okay right and so I think\nThis is a movie about that made by a group of women filmmakers and so I think our our conclusion and the movie is like well what happens when you start vibrant woman's mind in dire [laughter] you know\nLike your husband tonight's takes and\nYou can see Maggie Gyllenhaal into kindergarten teacher this week it started streaming on Netflix\nTomorrow for for for friday night being shown\nOn bridges coming up right after this don't hand over that I'll cable\n\nHurricane micro continues to wreak havoc through the Gulf Coast region
