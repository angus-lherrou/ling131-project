hearing a little bit more of Kanye West visit to the oval office yesterday\nWhy why\nRe in power we are on the job\nEntertainment I mean we may or anything and try not to mirror and we're getting our little thing\nAnd what he's doing now feels counter to that and you know he's siding with the people that are you know the forces that are oppressing black people so I think you know it's kind of hurt the reception of his recent music I feel like is this most recent record is not sort of stayed in the conversation away records like uses did so\nWell do you think that what is it Phil tell us if we take a step back from the moment that were and said we're we're all kind of embroiled in this conversation you take a step back and just ask for a second what's what does it say about the intersection between celebrity and politics in America today\nI think it's sort of a free for all like all bets are off now that we have a reality t._v. shows as president you know that just breaks down the walls were everyone every celebrity to kind of become a part of this process and now people talk about like Oprah and the rock running for the Democrats with a straight face\nPolice I just had a minute last and I'd be interested what you think is the takeaway from what we saw with Kanye and Taylor Swift this week well\nI feel like I'm at that moment at the end of Sixth Sense when you find out that he's dead and suddenly you go back and you're looking at wait a second\nHave you been dead all along like I just feel like I'm reassessing all the different moves everybody has made over the past few years and just looking at them and going what have I been watching all of this time maybe I was wrong the whole time so I if I'm doing that I think a lot of people are doing that\nAnd other probably doing it a lot with the political process as well because that's where it mentioned who knows who's going to run I I don't know anymore and I'm afraid to to check every day I'm going to be honest\nUh both
