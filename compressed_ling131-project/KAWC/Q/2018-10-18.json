[noise]\nYou get more time\nMaybe do this this is called ... says lightly just alternative you know sort of create the illusion I'm a no lasting forever [noise]\nOoh\nAnd that's why they say the piano is sort of the orchestra and went when there's an opera being rehearsed and they can't afford the orchestra until the last two weeks of versus those for those other six months they were her sing it they have a pianist is the only instruments that can credibly imitate you know rhythm [noise]\nAnd of course it can do harmony\n[noise]\nHow can any other instrument do that I mean perhaps the guitar in some way I mean it's portable that's a nice advantage but truly it's perhaps the piano that is that atomic level of music plays alone and you are covering all the basis of what music is supposed to be melody harmony rhythm and sound\nSo but when you when you're composing is that's satisfying I only ask because I didn't know when you're in your composition whether the piano can do everything you want it to do [noise]\nI don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is this atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive of complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers\nThis atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were\nGuitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court progression how to leave space what is it to take all the ear of the listener these are all skills that if you are stuck too much and you're instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get too caught up in their instrumental identity\nAnd yes there's different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instrument list has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nBut these twelve notes here in all of western music from classical through to today's pop music these twelve notes have still reigned Supreme you know you walk into a studio where they make rap music you're going to see some some drum machines but you will definitely see a synthesizer which has these twelve notes of the piano\nJust rent dirt on you know the keys are made of plastic and and there isn't an acoustic mechanism to hear those right away but that prism is still through which musicians the music at least in the western world\nI Want to talk more about the conservatory at you set up sort of a musical boot camp in in Paris tells a little bit more about it\nAnd that was a performance boot camp I feel like music was performance for hundreds of years than there was an aberration called recording we suddenly thought oh there's a permanent record which is why it's called a record of a song against which all other subsequent performances will be measured it's kind of terrifying for a musician\nSo I thought how can I get younger musicians who have come up in this SoundCloud era who in a really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual\nWay to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a young musician so I went out of my way to sort of developed techniques that would\nForce them to trust their instincts to create a kind of control the discomfort within which they can compose and perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with eggs timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical styles that was a rapper from Texas to jazz saxophonist from Ukraine classical guitarist from Guyana\nYou had a singer songwriter\nFrom Argentina that we make thing nicknamed Mexican faced at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground\nAnd not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every moment of the actual work wasn't reality t._v. they weren't filmed in their personal moments but when we were working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they needed to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush\nWhich is replicating probably early man\nYou know fight or flight response when they might do something like ... are the stakes were very high life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation rather than fear of death if you can make\nExactly and the stakes were very high in life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation resident fear is that if you can make friends with that fear of humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it even sort of let the audience know by taking risks\nTo look like a magic trick a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and you know ... ... ... get my way out\nI it is kind of an escape routine every time that you go up on stage you have to escape from the box that you put yourself in are you going to do October third yet what significance of the data to protect\nThat is it dates from I I Can't really explain the details because it's just too private and and so there are things that yeah there's there's things you keep ... yeah I I you know I I Choose what to share with my audience because I Know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance\nOctober third has been out titled because they wanted people to know that emotionally this piece has different\nThe pieces even dedicated to myself\nI Want people to know\nThis is the emotional core of the album but of course I don't want to say why dedicate yourself yes ...\nYou're you're ... the real neat I dedicated to myself because this is a piece that I wrote on that date where it's something very [laughter] life changing

the CBC right it's always good to come back to the CBC it's always a little bit of a homecoming ah\nI'm looking forward to talking to you about the winners but I Want to take it back for a moment you wrote the secret trilogy which was the literary erotic a huge success it was called the Canadian fifty shades of gray and I love that you had the idea to write them when you were writing Kevin old ghost riding Kevin ... autobiography\nBecause when I think about Kevin ... autobiography I think literary erotica\nI think it's because it was the opposite right um I had been steeped in to business books with him back to back working with him on ... on his sat on his on his box\nAnd I had a wall and uh the editor at the time that I worked with Nina need I Need to ... um basically said you should do something fun next you know\nMaybe the throat of an erotic buck you know fifty shades is doing so well I mean if it's halfway decent will publish it and I I took it seriously as to say I would I Would definitely try that I Would try and I had at that and\nAh and I did I wrote three back to back in Eighteen months to did you did it under a pseudonym yes my pseudonym is actually my manager's name\n'em as el Marie ... Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the student\nAh everybody was writing them under a pseudonym and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine Anna's name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and it was a plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhen it started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like I kinda wish I use my own there\nNo no no no and I I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance and erotic genre and leadership um it's a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if they'd be a fan of the stuff that I tend to write for myself you know like the winters for instance\nSo let's talk about the winters as we can really see Gabriel her new book the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came out in Nineteen thirty eight at the book it's never been out of print Alfred\nI mentioned is the beginning it's based on Daphne du ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came out in Nineteen thirty eight at the book of never been out of print Alfred\nHitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty what's your personal connection to the original\nRebecca ah it's fraught and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three books that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people um the other one was one of the other one was um a collection of poems by Alfred lord tennis and\nAnd the chariots of the gods so kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story with um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watch that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop he didn't have very many movies in his collection but he would play the same sort of jumped on pain movies over and over again\nSo I I grew up knowing about the story watching the story then I read the book in high school and was kind of blown away because in the book maxim do winter murdered his wife admits it gleefully ... gets away with it and the narrator loves him more so for it\nAnd I never saw it that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock ... murder for obvious reasons and so it's a love story\nAnd they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca my right\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working I was at home trying to sort of caught my next career move 'em my cat had died oh the election was obviously fought for a lot of women and so I and I and I am a new ... I'm a news junkie and I had enough\nSo shut off you know the news and started to watch my favorite movies to see if I could sort of get myself out of the ... and through in Rebecca on both criterion collections of the movie [noise] and uh\nIt just was overwhelmed with the sense of you know max into winter gets away with murder and had the sense that men are getting away with a lot and I you know came to me and suddenly that it would be a fun exercise to write a book inspired by Rebecca\nWherein the men haven't changed max and winter and my book becomes max winter Republican state senator\nUh but the women have so my narrator and it's very different than the original narrator she has more agency she's been older she's much smarter\nAnd I want it to experiment with the notion that ah I wondered if she was still susceptible to that fairy tales you opened with off the top and sadly she is and to her detriment so then it turns into a thriller once she gets back to his mansion and the plot takes on a very different turn after that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Yuma", "day": "18"}
