this episode wonder women\n[noise]\nHere through belly an American biochemist once said I hadn't been aware that there were doors close to me until I started knocking on them Dr alien was born in Nineteen Eighteen and knocked out a lot of doors on the way to winning her Nobel Prize\nIn Nineteen eighty eight it's a familiar tale for any woman who was pursued a career in science\nAstronomer Jill Tarter also pounded on a lot of doors on her way to becoming a pioneer in her field as a young girl she had a nonstop curiosity about technology but growing up in the Nineteen fifties she found scant encouragement for these interests she kept knocking on doors anyway\nThe gender symmetry didn't change much when she went to college Dr charter was the only woman in an engineering class of three hundred and went on to become one of the few females working in astronomy and eventually the field of set the the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nTo go out to the professor for an extension so we all we're trying to figure out a way to use my uniqueness to our best advantage\nThat if we fast forward later on in your career on you may have been able to leverage it in other ways and also I Wonder if when you heard the term so you're looking for a little green men\nI mean I've seen you wrote I don't know if I've actually seen you roll your eyes at that I've seen a squid like you are now um but that is also something I think that you have used here at advantage because you've turned it on its head\nYes certainly so when we started the study project within NASA when John Billingham started the project [noise]\nThe first thing we had to do was to build credibility and get beyond the UFO or little green men kind of connotations and I would walk into a room\nEither scientific colleagues or congressional staffers and a members of Congress themselves\nAnd because of the cultural norm they don't expect a woman to start talking about specifications and the details of the engineering and it was suddenly oh gee didn't expect to hear that maybe we should listen to her\nSo by simply showing and showing off some times that I was a lot smarter than they were with respect to the field that I was working in I could gain attention and I did for whatever it took\nThe question is always implied with you but I'll just ask it straight out since you've been doing this for a long time are we alone in the universe\nAre we alone I don't know the answer the question I'm that's why we're doing study that's why we're doing experiments observations to try and find out the answer\nShowing and showing off some time that I was a lot smarter than they were with respect to the field that I was working in I could gain attention and I did for whatever it took\nThe question is always implied with you but I'll just ask it straight out since you've been doing this for a long time are we alone in the universe is\nAre we alone I don't know the answer the question I'm that's why we're doing study that's why we're doing experiments observations to try and find out the answer when I was a student we knew\nLife at least intelligent technology logical life\nCouldn't live in very extreme environments had to be between the boiling and freezing points of water had to be neutral could be very acidic or very basic\nAnd that's all know exploded now that we've been studying extremophiles I mean who would've expected to find life kilometers down into the crust which we do live finds a way in all kinds of environment like find a way and so that's the story over my career has been\nThat the universe has appeared to be more bio friendly than when I started out it doesn't mean it is we haven't proven that that appearances actually translate into reality but I think we will in this century\nWell and and finally Jill I'm what does it mean that you have not found aliens so far in terms of how you sustain yourself psychologically in other words what's it like to work on a program that you may never have an answer for it\n[noise] when I started in this exploration I think I understood fairly well how big a question it was that I was trying to answer on that I might not find an answer\nBy the end of my life but it might be my granddaughter or her granddaughter that eventually succeeds Jill Tarter thank you so much for joining us today oh Molly it's been a

at Rio de surveys the dot com\nOne of the barriers to women pursuing careers in science and technology is a climate that is subtly unwelcome or worse\nUs men and women and space science and astronomy has been in the news and gotten our attention but some researchers suspected that was more to the story as big as it was\nThey wanted to quantify other alarming anecdotes that they were hearing associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois captain Clancy and colleagues surveyed more than four hundred astronomers and planetary scientists with questions of their experience in the workplace over the last five years but this survey was unique\nWe focused our attention on the experiences of women of color because women of color if it's a double bind and we wanted to see the extent to which we could see that in the sciences\nThe researchers asked the women about eight different issues related to identity gender gender identity race sexuality physical ability mental ability narrow diversity that is variations in neurological conditions and religion\nAnd we out to the extent to which they had overheard disparaging remarks about these kinds of identities to the extent to which that they had experienced verbal and physical harassment as a result of these identities\nAnd then whether or not they'd ever felt unsafe in their workplace and finally whether or not they'd ever skipped professional event due to feeling unsafe\nThe result was the paper coauthored by Dr Clancy double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science women of color face greater risks of gender and racial harassment published in the summer of twenty Seventeen in the journal of geophysical research planets\nThe results may have been given less attention at the time and they deserved because they were published in a niche journal but the implications are as broad as they are sobering\nOur main findings where is that women of color experienced a the greatest degrees of verbal and physical harassment even more so than white women that they felt unsafe in their workplace in extraordinarily high numbers\nForty percent of the women of color in our sample so that they felt unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender and you know that was a really devastating them for us and then of course a number of women or women of color and white women reported that they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe what\nWas your reaction to the results of your survey and from one account I read that you were devastated and I wonder if you could expand on that because women and women of color have reported this sort of behavior for a long time so should the survey results couldn't have come as a complete surprise no\nUm I mean the thing is is that none of this work that I've been doing for the last five years has ever surprise me you know it's not that a single time I've seen data and been like oh\nI had no idea that women of color were going to experience and greater degree uses harassment\nUm instead what I think it is as there's there's something about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them\nBut it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it we didn't define it we\nSpeaking about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them but it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it\nWe didn't define it we just ask them to what you know have you ever felt unsafe in your workplace and have you ever skipped any professional events because you felt unsafe and so that certainly leaves it open for responding to interpret that term however they like\nYou know the way I might interpret it might be different from the way you read it but either way I think it's going to be a pretty negative workplace experience if you could ever label what you're experiencing is unsafe\nYou use the term in your abstract micro aggressions and I wonder if you distinguish between micro aggressions that one experiences in the workplace and a blunt hostile remark an actual physical aggression\nSo micro aggressions are really about different types of incivility\nOr unpleasant interactions you may have in the workplace that are clearly a result of your identity and usually specifically a result of your race that's really where the term I Believe originally came from his understanding racial micro aggressions so someone might say something that I'm very subtly racially motivated\nLike making a comment about oh how often do you actually wash your hair\nTo an African American person or a or I'll actually I'll tell you one that I I Know happened here on my campus because uh a lecturer told me about an a student of her telling her about it is that uh there was this one African American woman and a lecture hall she was one of the only African American women in the entire chemistry class\nAnd she could hear a couple of white men behind her giggling\nAnd couldn't figure out why and then at the end of the class realize they had stuck a pen in her hair [noise]\nUm you know she had sort of an afro and it was a a department of chemistry Penn\nSo it was like a let's make it as obvious as possible that you are not welcome here that we find something other end and weird about you\nWas heartbreaking truly in and you identified this was reading that I'm Eighteen percent of women of color and twelve percent of women\nJust skipped out on a professional meetings on seminars and other events that they would otherwise go to because they wanted to avoid this hostile climate that it's so bad that you [laughter]\nThat you avoid doing the thing that you love and participating in your field and and collaborating with your your colleagues because you don't know how you're going to be treated in that meeting\nOh exactly and you don't want to be reminded of you know the person who made a pass at you at lunch or the person who made you feel smaller made you feel stupid so you miss out on that seminar you miss out on the chance to\nMeet you know the senior colleague who does the work that you do um or chance to bond with some of your friends or or a chance to just learn something new and exciting you know [noise]\nUm and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or help them meet the right person who helps them with a promotion I'm One of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all represented in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to\nUm and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or help them meet the right person who helps them with a promotion I'm One of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all represented in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to John and me because I Want it to be in a less hostile discipline\nAnd so I mean that makes me think that physics might actually be even worse than astronomy in terms of\nHow hostile it is or just how intimidating that workplace can feel workplace aggression and sexual harassment in the workplace or not new but you found that people did not expect to find them present in the sciences as well and why would people think\nThat the science is would be immune to aggression and sexual harassment\nShort and this is one of the things that I find\nFrustrating sometimes in fact as someone who's both a ... a social scientist and a trained like scientists because I'm a biological anthropology is um some always surprised when I encountered scientists from other disciplines\nWho are incredibly staunch believers that science is a meritocracy that the best people who do science are the ones who stay in science and they're the ones who succeed in science they're the ones who get the best papers and the best funding\nAnd they just couldn't be further from the truth I mean what really matters in science is your pedigree what matters unfortunately is often your identity\nOr the number of African American female post docs that I've known over the last five to seven years\nWho um end up on every shortlist that they go up you know when they go up for jobs and then are always there's always a white man chosen over them and it's always they're always told afterwards oh well you interviewed really well but this other person was just a better fit for our department\nYou know these are extraordinary scientists that I'm Talking about who aren't getting these jobs so it's not that they're not good enough right they're getting the interviews\nI really think that scientists have to start paying closer attention to issues of implicit
