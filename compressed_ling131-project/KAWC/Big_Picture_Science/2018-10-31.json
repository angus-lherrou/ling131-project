itself [noise]\nI've never gotten to the origin of this be which and smell and now I'm going to\nA little bit of research tells me that half a mile from the train station is the likely source so I'm going there now\nI'm approaching the factory and\nIt is starting to smell like chocolate [noise]\nWalking through the guitar trucking company\nCan give it to stretch of microbiology\nAll right so this is a bona fide chocolate company and I'm guessing that you may be the source of that wonderful aroma that hits me occasionally at the train station\nYes we are in the process of roasting cocoa beans and the smell from those cocoa beans diffuses out into the air and it smelled like hot cocoa when you're sitting outside somewhere away from the the point it\nNow why is it that I just smell it occasionally um and it seems to be only in the evenings but maybe that's just when I'm returning home but I don't know that every day\nHas to do with the wind direction as to do with the humidity it has to do with all the atmospheric conditions but we're roasting pretty much every day so it's out there but you're just not smelling into the roost in smell is\nQuite full an aromatic I thought it had to be brownies and cookies but it's not as the beans themselves\nTo the essence of chocolate which are the cocoa beans and part of the flavor development is created through that roasting process to get used to the smell I mean at some point does your nose adapt and you don't smell that wonderful chocolate anymore\nAs you approach the plant and smell it will always recognize it but when you're in the plant you could use to smell so thank you very much you solve this mystery for me You're welcome [noise]\nAs I leave the factory the air is perfume to the center of roasting cocoa beans [noise]\nAnd I learned that I'm not imagine yet the realm of chocolate really does feel the air at the train station because half a mile away there at the chocolate factory or shall we call it a chocolate olfactory\nGood slipping Molly I Hope you'll bring some of that chocolate to the studio when you come in\nNow dogs tracked down since routinely that's what they do they lead with their noses humans are born smugglers too but you know with the exception of the mouth watering the realm of sweets we often dismissed the odors that envelop of dogs do not smelling is how the map their world\nFor a dog the air is filled with information they have hundreds of millions more full factory receptors and there's now than we do making them serious sniffer\nDogs can detect trace of explosives and even certain cancers they can perceive sense that we can't and we might experience more if we took a cue from them says dog ... mission researcher Alexandra Horowitz she's the author of being a dog fall I'm going to dog into a world of smell\nI Am following my nose along Amsterdam avenue toward Dr horror with his dog cognition lab at Barnard College I'm picking up odors of hot\nPretzels cut flowers\nIndian spice and I imagine entering the dog cognition lab and being greeted by dog smells in a row of sniffing animals first though I meet Alexandra Horowitz in our campus office [noise]\nWere in your office at Barnard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but somewhere\n... were in your office at Bernard but the dog cognition lab I understand is nearby but somewhere in the vicinity if I were dog I could probably sniff it out\nOr we should maybe revise because this is really the dog cognition lab the dog ... anywhere where we're studying dogs essentially so we do actually\nDo some behavioral tests in this room there's tape on the floor so we are videotaping and monitoring what the dogs are doing but I also studied dogs out and their natural environment in the parks I go to an earth homes I said he dogs they're so\nKind of any place that their dogs could be the cognition lab\nOkay so it turned out the dog cognition lab was right under my nose [noise] dogs have some of the makings of good scientists they're curious about everything they can't stop collecting data but since dogs don't submit their conclusions about what they smell to referee journals\nDr horribly studies there sniffy behavior to make inferences about their cognition and what's ... they are\nDogs have now been trained detection dogs have now been trained to tell us when they notice all manner of object and\nReally most objects have a smell potentially if you had the equipment to detect it so that is everything from you know explosives detection dogs they're cancer detection dogs their dogs who can detect bedbugs of course than any other varieties many other varieties of insects\nThere are Scott detection dogs in other words dogs are being used by researchers to\nFind the scat the ex Greta of wildlife populations that they're trying to canvas but that are hard to see their diabetes ... dogs can tell when blood sugar is dropping\nSo really you could put their nose in any direction just tell them what it is that you want them to notice and they'll notice it for you\nDogs can detect all manner of objects as you say and how much do they need to detect any just a tiny bit and and and how how low does that that concentration go\nWhere they're not even being Smith stripe but it's that some by extension my dog's interest in your dogs roamed is somehow reflecting on not like that to me is mostly a testament of our unease with smell\nIn fact you write that our discomfort with the dogs sniffing the world has prompted some owners to pull their dogs back and so dogs sniffing as much as they would like to because they are getting the signal that they shouldn't be sniffing although that's what they do\nRight I don't think we're ready to accept often that dogs they're sniffing creatures we want them to be polite civilized\nCreatures who don't do that animal let's stick thing like sniffing each other and I found that um a lot of dogs are coming into my studies where I'm basically asking them to sniff something I put on the floor you know I'm a sample of their own Pierre their time it's a quantity of food it's it they're usually benign stimuli\nA lot of dogs who come in with their owners' loan approach the samples\nAnd I think it's because the owners have been spent a lifetime telling that dog not to miss things\nActually when we pull our dog away from the smells we're telling them they're not allowed to\nYou know use that perceptual Oregon and they and they're pretty cooperative they kind of stop using it as much [noise] it's sad that they can learn to use it again right and when they come upon this you know must be like discovering your own superpower now\nI was amazed to learn that dogs can smell well it's not it's not surprising that they could smell the movement of air through the room but because they can do that you write that they can actually smell the time of day so I'm Wondering if you could tell us the difference between how afternoon in mourning smells yeah or what would a dog I say\nI Wish I knew exactly but I think I can almost imagine a little bit it's like the way of seasons have a different smell right we might notice the advent of spring but a lot\nMore is happening when the seasons change than in our living room throughout the day\nThe temperature of the room changes all day right I think that's what it is it's that air flow through the day is pretty reliable um air rises along the walls\nAs the room is warm and then it kind of hugs the ceiling and then starts falling and it kind of crashes into itself and imagery of this and it's kind of wonderful like a backwards waterfalls of air going up the walls and then and then crashing down as a waterfall in the middle of the room\nSo I haven't seen an example of how dogs do use this to tell the time of day but we can see that dogs are attuned to odors in different parts of the room at different times of the day so they are presumably\nWe can see that dogs are attuned to odors in different parts of the room at different times of the day so they are presumably marking that day by this air flow that's natural Airflow\nI'm so for instance one's own smell it in the room will be moved to the side of the room and your abs sense as the day goes on\nWhen you were going to the self directed experiment on trying to improve your own smelly inability could smell like your dog [noise] um did you ever sit in a room and and try to see if you could smell the different times of day\n[noise] haven't sat in the room the way dogs might send in the room all day and try to smell the difference I don't think I have the acuity for that but I have done other ... and I regularly do other exercises still that\nTry to bring smell and prominently so my wake up in the morning I Try to smell how late it is you know five if I don't set an alarm so\nAnd and how how do you smell how how late it is what what is it what six AM versus nine AM that's exactly\nWhat you're trying to smell you're trying to smell kind of the war of the day how much of the day it's happened there is a smell in a room at a certain time of day and I think you might notice that if it was different it's that type of thing and I also try to figure out if there's anyone in the bed with me and I are dog sleep with us\nAnd so I had my husband my cat and two dogs and my son who might be in the bed in the morning and without hearing or seeing anything I Try to\nJust noticed by smell if anyone's in the bed and sometimes I can do it not not reliably not all the time but that's the type of thing I Try to do to imagine a little bit what might be like to be that dog\nI assume you've invested in a king size bed [laughter] it's the biggest that you can get yeah Alexandra Horowitz thank you so much for speaking with us my pleasure\nAlexandra Horowitz has a dog cognition researcher at Barnard College and author of being a dog following
