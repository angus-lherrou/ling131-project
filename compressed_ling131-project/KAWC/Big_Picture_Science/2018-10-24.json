so we're probably going to and you know of a millimeter to my waist within the hour [noise]\nBut you know one thing I never thought it would do and that is modify my DNA\nAlthough I have to say even if it does I'm going to finish that don't [noise]\nI'm ...\nI'm Molly Bentley welcome to the big picture science produced at the SETI Institute where researchers investigate the nature and the origin of life and they picture science we give you the wide angle view and science and technology\nHeredity was once understood to be straightforward genes were passed from parents to offspring and you were blessed or stuck with a lot you got\nDNA did not change over a lifetime well now we know that isn't true your environmental exposures and lifestyle influence the chemical switches that govern your DNA is behavior moreover powerful gene editing tools lettuce tinker with genes directly\nEditing them or adding new ones and they may be evidence in both cases that one generations genetic alterations can be inherited by the next and this episode the scientists at the genetics NASA's astronaut twin study editing the mosquito genomes to prevent malaria\nAnd how all these challenges are traditional concept of heredity its DNA is not destiny\n[noise]\nWe have two stories each from an unusual laboratory where experiments in genetic modification are testing our old notion that DNA is destiny the second will come later in the show but we can tell you that both labs\nShare something in common there secured with air locks the first air lock as necessary because there is no air and space [noise]\nAll the air lock the doors to the international space station that allows you to go\nOutside into space and hopefully back inside because it could make it back inside\nStation that allows you to go\nOutside into space and hopefully back inside because it could make it back inside the really bad I this is Scott Kelly I'm a former NASA astronaut than US Navy fighter pilot test pilot\nCaptain county was on the international space station for about a year during which time something funny happened to his DNA and we know that because scientists compared Scott's DNA with that as identical twin brother mark on earth the results of this NASA twin study revealed the workings of at the genetics\nWe had talked about ... percent of the genes that had changed expression\nDid not yet returned back to normal and so ah unfortunately a couple of media outlets picked it up and just said seven percent of his games were lost as this seven percent of his DNA had changed and keeping in mind that between us insurance to really just a you know one percent and other species just a handful of present so the last seven percent of the genes or DNA\nIt'd be a different species right so um some of those reports were definitely wrong and that just set the record straight it became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed\nSome of those reports were definitely wrong in the desert the record straight it became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed since obviously the expression of the gene is like the when you read the book of life\nIs what is really active form of genetic code versus just losing a whole page from your book of life which is what kind of some of the headlines looked like for a little while they're really exciting thing though is that we know of a shortlist ... to keep an eye on for future astronaut that seemed to change when you're up there and and don't go back right away\nYou know if he'd come back a different species have if he went up a man and and and came back a turtle I mean that would have been you know dismaying for his wife I Would I Would think yeah yeah he would you know we get less applicants to the astronaut program in Christopher Mason thanks very much for speaking with us great thank you my pleasure\nChristopher Mason is an associate professor of genetics in computational biology at Weill Cornell medicine and now a decidedly earth bound astronaut reaction to being a lab rat in space\nScott it sounds like a year in some sort of conveying it's are you in a car somewhere\nI'm In a spaceship going to Mars [laughter] no actually\nI'm In a suburban heading to the island Ga I Wish there was [laughter]\nNow when you came back to earth and you heard about these epigenetic changes what was your reaction to hearing about that stuff\nYeah I don't know you know it's it's something that you know is not symptomatic\nI Can't feel it [noise] I think interesting information for me\nAnd what about the telomeres because unlike what normally happens you know as you get older your telomeres shorten you know did you did you notice that at least that you say wow I feel Twenty years younger or something [noise]\n[noise] no but uh you know my telomeres apparently it's got a better but you know within a couple of months after I got on the back where they were previously not about you\nBut that's disappointing well finally than Scott you know you come back to earth and at least for a while that some of your DNA has been altered did you feel like you didn't have an identical twin during that period\nI Hope so but when I see him in her city works somewhat similar me so I guess not\n[laughter] well Scott thanks very much\nAll right take care of\nCaptain Scott Kelly is a former military test pilot and astronaut what fascinates you about this study\nWell I think it's interesting to me simply because of the immediate applicability to the human exploration of the solar system I mean you know we we we go to Mars we go to the moons of Jupiter we go all over the solar system every night on my TV\nBut one of the big unknowns is how good an idea is that is that going to affect the health of the crew members in ways that we haven't yet learned about so you know this this study bears on that TV show are you watching that travel all over the\nSolar system just about any ... show on the air and there always are plenty of them [noise] Mm\nWell it's wild stuff but as we heard the changes to astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA were mostly reversed after he spent time on earth\nThey stuck around\nThe story gets even weirder with each passing the epigenetic changes can be inherited in other words\nThe consequences of behavior could be passed down to the next generation hits\nThe in is not destiny on big picture science [noise]\nWell John thank her my downtime they're not actually getting hit by a bird and cook o'clock and by that and you're wondering why we say walk someone someone\nWhy did they did that you know I Do not so great you're having a nurture joined us this week for a way with words [noise]\n\n\nWay with words broadcast tomorrow evening at the same time right here on K.

ended up information on events community members outdoor activities and attributes unique to humans southwest living can be found at living in Yuma dot com\n[noise]\n\nThe results of the NASA twin study hard only relevant to astronauts there yet more evidence that everyone's DNA is subject to sometimes dramatic a modification by our environment Scott Kelly's DNA\nReverted to his pre flight chemistry when he returned to earth and it's our understanding that epigenetic changes accumulated over a lifetime are erased the four genes are passed to a new generation\nBut we aren't certain of that research on non human species suggests that at least some of the changes can be passed down\nReporter Carl Zimmer whose latest book is on the science of heredity describes those studies and what the NASA twin studies says and does it say about changes do astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA\nYeah so what is happening in a study like that is that the actual a sequence of letters and Scott's genes is not being rewritten by being in space\nBut when scientists look at his cells before and after and compare them to his brother marks they can see that there are epigenetic differences they can see that the pattern of molecules around his DNA\nSeems to be different in some regards than it was before now\nIn some cases and then maybe it would be in the case of Scott's if some genes are turned on and they're turned off due to environmental factors could those changes in those genes or the activation or the dorm at state of those genes be passed on to another generation\nAh well that is a very big controversy I'm so this is something called a trans generational epigenetic inheritance nice big craze and so the idea there is that an experience that a person or some other species has\nAlters the upper genetics and their cells that includes germ cells in other words egg and sperm that that can then produce the next generation and that next generation the idea goes can inherit the epigenetic changes along with the genes\nAnd so there are lots of really good compelling examples in nature that this can indeed happened uh they just don't really include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant\nAnd mining its own business and it gets attacked by\nThey include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant and mining its own business and it gets attacked by some insects\nSo plants switch on a bunch of genes when they sense this sort of attack and they produce a bunch of chemicals that the hope is quote unquote to drive off the insects or at least sort of minimize their attack\nPlants that experience an attack from insects or or pathogens they will produce seeds and if the windows seeds grow into new plants they will actually respond faster to these kinds of attacks than they would have otherwise like they have a memory yeah\nAnd the same is true of the seeds that you produce from those plants um and so you that seems to go through several generations with plants\nWell here's a blue sky question you're ready actually it's higher than blue skies [laughter] at the [noise]\nThe orbit of the international space station let's say that Scott had fathered a child in space when he was his molecules are undergoing these changes is it possible that anything that has changed in ... we say is DNA did not change that any of these epigenetic factors could have been passed down to this child\nThere is no evidence from humans that it could have and part of that reason for that is that it seems that plant biology and animal biology are very different and the way that epigenetics is controlled in those kinds of organisms is different\nAnd so in humans during that process of an embryo developing producing its own eggs or sperm\nA lot of those epigenetic marks that may have accumulated in one's lifetime get stripped away in those cells and then a third of a baseline set of epigenetic marks or put back in place\nNow exactly how it works we don't know but we do know that if you exercise a lot they will modify the DNA in your muscles and actually change expression of genes and principals so you might get stronger and live longer\nI I can understand how exercise might modify the condition of my muscles their tone whatever but the DNA I mean does that get passed on or is that in DNA that will never make it to the next generation\nThey will not make it to the next generation in that particular case as far as we know now turns out though that nutrition probably affects your DNA and can pass on\nIn some ways that we don't fully understand that as an example when in the city of St Petersburg during World War two lots of people starved\nAnd actually people came out short for generations after that and there are other examples of this was well that's thought to happen by DNA modification and in fact there's one other interesting example I can tell you about which is in Guyana you can actually look at\nWhen kids are conceived not when they're born but when they're ... which is nine months before when they're born\nAnd it turns out that kids conceived in the rainy season\nCome out different in height and build than those in the dry season those in the dry season the parents are better nutrition the mom in particular\nAnd so the kids come out a little bit healthier and a little bit bigger and it's also the case they have differences in their modify DNA so that as I say nutrition actually does affect the modification of your DNA now exactly how that makes you bigger and a healthier we don't understand and that's thought to be able to pass and to next generations\nI gotta say this is astounding because this this this sounds like I don't know the marquee and evolution this sounds like the stories you know that they believed a two hundred years ago that giraffes just stretch their next a little bit and so baby giraffes have longer next I mean I thought that that was long gone that idea\nWell I I think most of the more permanent things giraffes probably are genetically controlled or or how much has influenced by a genetics isn't fully understood but it is clear there are epigenetic in fact most of them don't pass generation or so it's thought we don't fully understand very active area of research\nBut it's pretty clear the epigenetic does affect you I mean you and now it turns out that believe it or not as you age or DNA modifies as well in fact you can tell how old someone is from the modifications in their DNA\nMy goodness All right well don't look in mind set\nBy the way that does not pass the next generation some modifications in your DNA that are are associated with your age they will not pass them to the next generation that clock reset so when you start out as a baby you are baby\nI say you don't get boring as a as an old cod jerk [laughter] no no not at all you know we talk about controlling future generations by modifying DNA and I mean this has been kept to wait and then the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't\nTrolling future generations by modifying DNA I mean this isn't kept elated and the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't too expensive I don't know but this sounds like you could do things by you know just modify your diet and maybe your kids live I don't know more musical talent I mean is that truly does it go that far\nYeah that's not so clear I mean again it's a very poorly understood area and that's why a lot of people are working on it it's very very clear that the nutrition on other health of a pregnant mom\nHas a huge influence on the unborn fetus so that she pregnant women need to take care of themselves obviously hear how they shouldn't smoke and drink alcohol those are very very real effect now to what extent they wind up modifying the DNA\nOf the fetus is not so clear but it is very likely that is the case so I Would argue that that's a huge and very important developmental time\nAnd in fact there's an area called preterm birth babies are born to early can have significant health problems and and that often happens because of issues associated with environment so pregnant women who live in poor areas have a much higher incidence of preterm birth\nAnd it's not because they're not necessarily giving good nutrition and such to their kids\nThe child will not develop properly and and maybe get worn early and that does have serious health consequences\nAnd so it's plausible we don't know for sure but it seems very likely that some of that will be at the genetic then those kids that are born earlier could modify DNA that's a little bit different than those of others so environment does have a big effect\nMichael Snyder thanks very much for speaking with us\nThanks for having me here\nMichael Snyder is the chair of the genetics
