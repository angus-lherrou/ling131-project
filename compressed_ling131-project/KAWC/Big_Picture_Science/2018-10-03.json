platforms glowing with celebrity ... such and that his spouse by model actress an anti vaccine activists Jenny McCarthy but here's the thing since we're urged to be our own health advocates and to seek second opinions why not outsource to Hollywood\nWhy not follow the advice of the photogenic I mean pearly smiles million dollar mansions things seem to be working out for them\nPaul Offit is a professor of pediatrics at the children's hospital of Philadelphia and the ... school of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania his wry responses in the title of his latest book\nThat advice or why celebrities politicians and activists aren't your best source of health information however he does explain why we're tempted to follow them\nAll I'd like to begin by simply asking you the very question that's posed by the subtitle of your book why would celebrities or politicians are activists be anyone's best source of health information\nWell I think in part because we think we know them you know celebrities are people that we see on the big screen or little screen the same thing's true politicians and I think at some level because they've been given a platform they have influence I mean you you look at who is ...\nSee on the big screen or little screen the same thing's true politicians and I think at some level because they've been given a platform they have influence I mean you you look at who is used to sell products invariably it celebrities because people think that they know them I mean they don't pick experts on that particular product to sell them and they pick celebrities\nAll right so we feel that we know them and consequently we should listen to them it's sort of like your next door neighbor I mean if they were telling you you know something that might be relevant to your health would you listen to them if they you know they weren't actually medical doctors\nYes that's exactly what people do listen to them because they trust them whereas the doctor or the clinician is seen as somebody a little more distant more formal part of the medical industrial complex and so\nPeople are a little more turned off by them I especially these days you know you go to a doctor's office the doctor said there's there's it's a computer screen types in your information often doesn't look at you it's distancing whereas your neighbors your friends are going to give you information that helps you\nOut if it doesn't well now let's follow up a little bit on that because when a politician she was written up in the New York times actually it was a big big story about her company group that started out as a website for health and lifestyle advice and then it has grown into a multibillion dollar company\nIt's gotten a lot of criticism for making health and wellness claims that are not supported by science and that seems to have only increased the business\nWhat it is it about going to ... given the health advice\nYou I'm not so sure it's her specifically as as much as what she's offering she's offering magic she's offering these wonderful magical cures if you have an auto immune disorder for which medicine offers little or appears to offer little she has magic glasses or\nYou know magic rubs that can make you better I mean this is not new I think for centuries we've been very much drawn in by snake oil salesmen she's just a modern day ... salesman\nWell given an example of bad health advice and possibly also an example of it being consequential\nShe argues that if you want to bounce you're uterine hormones that what you should do is you should have vegetables steaming with McGuire it I'm\n... steaming is not a good idea it can cause burns and serious infections are aside from the fact that it's never going to get into your uterus and my word is in a hormone it's terrible advice and then in addition she recently or not so recently has talked about\nJade eggs that one and search that into The Vagina in order to induce a better muscle tone but if you have foreign bodies sitting in your ... periods of time you can have bacterial over both especially with bacteria that cause\nSo called toxic shock center that's what happened with those super absorb and tampons a couple of decades ago when we had an outbreaks of a toxic shot sooner because of that recommendation\nBut in New York Times magazine piece it said that ... has given into pressure\nAnd says the company will hire a fact checker um so you know that her claims about I don't know magically charged stones and and maybe these are ... steaming routines maybe they will be dropped from the website do you have any uh optimistic thoughts about this [noise]\nNo I think what will happen is is that you'll probably see vigor statements in other words the FDA can actually crack down on you if you make a specific medical recommendation so for example if you say concentrated garlic is going to lower\nYour bad cholesterol so called low density liberal protein cholesterol than the FBI can crack down here a few ... and make a vague or claim supports heart health sports joined health boost immunity then it's a little harder to crack down I just I think they're just going to get bigger would be my guess\nNow obviously patrol is simply an example of of more general phenomenon we listen to celebrities and non experts as you say they're selling\nSo is simply an example of of more general phenomenon we listened to celebrities and non experts\nAs you say they're selling snake Oh yes perhaps but\nThey're also addressing things that people may not be able to get much better advice on a lot of your book describes the vaccine controversy that that vaccinations have caused autism and that's that's a field that you specialize in maybe you can tell me a little bit about the back story on that\nWell so the facts about or is this the modern medicine doesn't really know what does cause autism and so when parents of children who have\nThis disorder which is certainly emotionally and financially burdensome you know they want answers and medicine really doesn't have any answers or cures so this is we're often you'll see sort of quote unquote alternative fuel or step in they'll know what the causes so let's say they they say that vaccines cause it\nOr they know what yours are you know Casey and free diets gluten free diets and that's all very seductive\nFor parents who are desperate to do something anything to help their child and I this is the worst kind of ... to me or are people who take advantage of parents desperate desire to help their child but I think it's because there are limits to modern medicine and that's often where you see a groups like the step in\nThe whole ... story that a vaccination causes autism that was actually started by a legitimate medical researcher right I mean it disappeared and a referee journal I meet ... what happened there get give me that story just briefly\nRight so it was a it was a British a guest Ron raw trickle surgeon address surgeon Anita Andrew Wakefield who in Nineteen Ninety eight published a paper in the British medical journal called the Lancet which is you know one of the best of the general medical journals\nClaiming that the combination measles mumps rubella vaccine causes autism for what she had virtually no evidence of a sudden otherwise he had no evidence what he did was he had a case series which is to say\nEight children who had within the previous month received an imam or a vaccine that had been developed signs and symptoms of autism that's not exactly a proof he might as well as published a study of eight children who had leukemia that went in the previous month that eating peanut butter sandwiches and claimed that that was caused because that was about how rigorous is proof was of causality\nThere now Seventeen studies done in seven countries on three different continents involving hundreds of thousands of children showing that there is no relationship between receiving that vaccine developing autism so it didn't stand but the fact of the matter is it's hard to honoring the bell it's hard to scare people once you scared them and that's where we are now\nPeter do spark and to be clear she lives in the United states at the time\nRight right she's I'm HIV positive living with aids and she was part of the AIDS denial is that age I read and not cause aids and that the drugs would be toxic compared to not taking them so she refused to take the drugs that would have prevented her daughter um she was pregnant at the time\nWould have prevented her daughter from becoming HIV infected so her daughter was born unfortunately got HIV infected\nUm then she refused to have her daughter treated with at the time there is effective treatment\nSo uh her daughter died of aids and Christine died of aids after that\nAnd I'm Wondering this is not the first person who has denied the causal relationship and I'm Wondering why her story stands out to you because\nShe became an activist on a topic I'm not just I'm not going to do this for my own body and my daughter's situation but became a vocal activists shit on a website and other things that are actively try to make other people be part of that belief system\nSo something else psychological he drives people to actively say this is going to be what I'm going to stand for and try to convert other people to my belief system\nYou've used the term world view on a couple of times now in terms of framing the belief system I'm In this case professor does for\nMy other people who are science denial is and what what is the role of of a world view or a belief system in deciding whether or not you're going to accept the facts as science\nWe all have our own world views I'm speaking more\nPsychologically are sociologically not that it's a world campaign or something we have our own world views of how the world works\nAnd what's good and bad and how the world should be or how we hope it will be that's what I mean by world views and secondly we have our own areas of what we think are important all of us have our own different opinions and and third we have our own experience and we also are the experience of those people that we trust\nSo some combination of those three\nEnd up making us have decisions about what we trust and believe in\nSo we might believe in most things that have been Scientifically Proven but in certain areas who say well we're not so sure because our world view of mistrust of government or mistrust of\nA big business or we say well we're not so sure of this\nThe stories that you're telling about the science denialism around the link between HIV and AIDS\nSay well we're not so sure of this\nFinally the stories that you're telling about the science denialism around the link between HIV and AIDS began Thirty years ago and couldn't ones say well well that's old news and I'm Wondering what that particular story as science denialism has to do with the science denialism we're seeing\nToday well I guess the HIV causing AIDS denialism started almost exactly Thirty years ago with Peter ...\nI guess what it has to do today is that it should teach us that all of us have our own belief systems and we have a right to those belief systems it's part of the human nature they're governed as we said by our world view by our own view of what we think is important and by our past experiences\nBut when it affects other people out of harms other people then it's not right [noise] the same things happening for climate change the same thing happens with vaccines is when it's taken on for other reasons as a cause to prove some other point of view than it can be dangerous\nRichard Marlene thank you so much for speaking to us\nThank you so much falling\nRichard Marlene is the director of the Rutgers global health Institute\nAs a coda we know that in two thousand eight researchers at Harvard University reported that South Africa's misguided aids policies the gun in the Nineteen nineties and the attendant withholding of life saving drugs caused the deaths of more than three hundred thousand South Africans between the years two thousand and two thousand five\n[noise]\nClearly ignoring the expertise of doctors and scientists can have tragic consequences but are there are cases where we might turn to another kind
