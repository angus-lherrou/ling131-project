that is separate from our civilized own\nAs a result some of our observations about animals how ever well intentioned as superficial then you don't have to be clever at the Fox to recite a few popular tropes like quiet as a most dumb as an ox and that sneaky weasel\nRight that's right if I had an elephant's memory I could do better than say bloodthirsty batter brave it's a lion but enough monkey around the point is we make easy assumptions about animals based on their appearance or some aspect of their behavior\nPeople think that because that somehow evolutionary redundant Annette rubbish

just live in a different world they inhabit a different universe is that really true\nYeah yeah I think that's a great quote we see well we have well often there's not as I K but different animals

conservative habitat for example in the case of the vulture\nAnd more than that we don't understand why they're doing it I mean the animals are not deliberately being gross or anything like that that's their lifestyle and there's got to be a reason for it because otherwise we wouldn't be around doing it so we've got to resist the temptation to you know consider their behavior in the same

I don't feel that when I look at termites\nAnts move in a very a sort of ... by the jagged did weigh termites flow and to me they're not as disturbing to actually watch\nAnd then the second thing is I Would say termites have an extraordinary aesthetic\nWhen they're building a mound that can be say Fifteen feet tall [noise]\nThey feel inside of it with their antennas defined rough areas and wherever it's rough they pull away the dirt until it's smooth and so when you open up a termite mound it's this extraordinary world with these very smooth beautiful\nInterior spaces and I think if you look closely enough at termites they become quite beautiful\nNow when they're making their their mound what are they making them out of and what is the material that results\nLook different termites build in different environments so the termites that I watched for the longest time we're not going to turn ... and they were in Namibia and they build with little balls of mud which they making their mouths and the mud is\nSomewhat cemented with some kind of special termites saliva\nAnd we don't know exactly how they built but a basic description of it is that one tour might will put down one dirt ball and another term might will put down another dirt ball on top of that and then they keep piling up the dirt ball until they have like little peaks\nAnd then those little peaks kind of connect to make for the little walls\nAnd then those walls some of them have arches in them they begin to build up and one of the things that we know drives them is the smell of fresh air inside their mound it smells really intensely of termites smells really intensely a fungus\nAnd of course there's all this feces and they're constantly transferring microbial sort of starter culture to each other by mouth to mouth and melted but [noise]\nSo there's this intense smell in there and when any fresh air comes through some termites run from the fresh air into the mound and set off alarm a sort of a ... they they make a sound and then other termites grab a dirt ball they build and build until they've cut off the fresh air smell\nSo just to be clear the fresh air it's not something they're drawn to the way that we are when we want to step out of our buildings and get some fresh air the fresh air suggests that there may be holes are vulnerabilities in their defense system\nYes if you're termite you're constantly being attacked by aunts and aunt eaters an art barks an art wolves and anything else that can hack their way into your\nInto your mound so one of the things that you do if you're a termite is you you know how to control your perimeter and the way that they do that is that when they smell fresh air they know they need to go do something", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "17"}
