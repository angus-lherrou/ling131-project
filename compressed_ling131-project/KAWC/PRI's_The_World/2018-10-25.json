seven six nine zero\nI market where man this is the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nNow contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the ... column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nThat doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not they don't even want to trade war and they are pretty desperate to avoid one and work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise\nThat fringe of hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... unless starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great super part of the top of his of economic\nTotem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful than others has come out of out of the blue about them\nOr the Trans Pacific partnership that to be paid that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of those issues like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nA try I mean there was a a a retard very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was off the record like on sort of navy man but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to try and a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small bit of for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China when I was in DC\nI kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe that it's something to the the\nThe problem is that the machine in Washington\nHas kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try to fix the world trade older as you say Marco\nTo you know to what was something like the TTP where everyone opens their markets that will do a little trouble I think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nSo if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate and that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent\nTo the rest of the world the access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you pay the low we'll rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nSo he was a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China China is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be\nOne of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nTo go how they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks block they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they gave me the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get this when you talk to European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMorals as an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese have been undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the company's CEO and no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of\nThose who these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\n... is the problem is that you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reasonably senior Chinese officials are now working\nTheir way down the list of people who can explain to them and they go so low down the list their own people like me and I literally have conversations with them when I say I'm going to pose a it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet so she says this\nWas an ancient Greek historian who rose about when you had a a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably they into war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe state has ... finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist incite the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of different things from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person needs that kind of ... killed some time they've kind of New York real estate guy\nBecause if the guy who got any number of different things from getting them I think you know physically a kind of war like person these kind of money killed some time to kind of New York real estate guy um so I think that as people age to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries\nBut no longer thinks that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this is truly thing Donald Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents such that have been ready to watch trying to rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statement in a previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise\nIn the right way you would arise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the grace and the good a hoagie and special older along with everyone else but for Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nThis is a concern all around the globe right now like in Brazil we've been reporting on the heated presidential election runoff in Brazil this weekend\nRight wing candidate ... I was facing off against left his opponent Fernando ... died this information and fake news have been huge issues in that race a lot of it is playing out on the messaging platform what's up\nWhich we should note is owned by Facebook user Derek ... is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston studying all this at Harvard showing the center she's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and debunked fake news\n... tells me that the fake stories she's seeing a WhatsApp are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaign in review they sometimes can get absurd in what way at the support in in the knees and fears that are totally\nKnown things like Venezuela supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I would come in here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to\nBring new not becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah so what was his teacher Brazilians she was eight and\nShe's been in and she probably heard this thing's via watch that\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that has below connection with Venezuela is that one of the rumors spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is for the new this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older stale rumors making a comeback as Brazil's presidential race heats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an educational cheat to teach kids how to be gay\nWhile the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in schools and there will be connections with the government and a Venezuela and has a lot of the same time I see what you're saying by absurd\nUm just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charge I are both in our own launched this is that a legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve inches to up in the website of the right wing candidate\nHe created this as false information he was a a a member of that the corps so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are religious they supported him in this story and this became a motor\nBoats and our was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firm supply bundles of phone numbers and use them to mass tax properly\nThis week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firm survived bundles of phone numbers\nAnd use them to mass tax propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you also do record of a are trying to put out the flames before they turn into a fake news wildfire and Brazil\nWhat's very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and watch that and what we see a different types of presentations so\nWhen ... you have an audio let's say like there's this thing happening you have to act so there's a call to action that's very strong shared this otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country stuff like this\nOn Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos have text specialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe to what I see is that there's an entire since then if you look just to watch that ah we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I I'm I I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those guys I think we have a huge inequality and poor people are left behind in in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked by the impeachment of Duma that make people human ... a former president ... yeah [noise]\nUh that makes ... made people believing in and they don't believe in the ... anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nOr and I know there is no institutions that they would believe right now and and this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe\nIn the misinformation campaigns instead of believing in the institutions or newsrooms\nThat was ... on how fake news is playing out of Brazil's presidential election quarterback studies this information out of Harvard shore and seen center\nShe's also involved with ... a collaboration with Brazilian newsrooms and social media companies to take fake stories off their platforms the runoff election in Brazil by the way takes place this Sunday\n[noise] [noise]\nThere's a very well preserved shipwreck long at the bottom of the black sea off the coast of Bulgaria it is so old how old is it it may date back to a time when Aristotle was alive\nHard to believe this rock was found by a team of researchers using a remote controlled submarine I found more than sixty shipwrecks in total deep in the black sea\nIncluding this one Seventy five foot Greek trading vessel which they estimate has been lying under water for the past two thousand four hundred years\nWhich they say might make this the oldest intact shipwreck ever discovered professor John Adams was the principal investigator for the black sea maritime archeology project\nMost startling thing about let's see let's see if he's actually completely [noise]\nWhat else to complete the last is still standing the super structures that the ...\nThe most stop and think about this is let's say these are actually complete\nComplete the most is still standing the super structure is that the benches are still across the hall both relatives are there with the pill is still attached\nIt looks very much like some of the crop to fix his own a scene in fifth century bc vases I never thought I'd see anything like that in my life\nSeveral members of the team have also noted the ship bears a striking resemblance to the one on the siren ... at the British Museum on that bothers you see an image of a ... year strapped to the map as this ship sailed past three sirens\nMarine archaeologist Dr Helen far does this discovery could help historians connect some dots about travel in the classical world\nWe have three and four in the back of the census asked us to take action within that training while\nBecause I tried to die so what we didn't have with the ... say this where the hell of a night and it was hot and I think\nIt's unlikely that the ship will ever be displayed on land the reason the shipwreck has remained in such good condition for so long is the water it's been submerged in for centuries the black sea is and knock sick or free of oxygen and more than a mile below the surface there's not much marine life to disturb the wreck here's professor Adams again\nWell let me look said perfect to us [noise]\nThere was very little physical strength left in the timbers two thousand four hundred is as long time there are bacteria would work inside the souls of the woods and they're still actually actively even offer was tired\nI just said to me that means the ... has a new mechanical strength so you have to lift it piece by piece and even then it would be very very difficult\nSo I think we all technology that we have available to us now we can record is in such these\nWithout even touching but it's probably a federal law where it is\nOther fined by the black sea maritime archeology project include Roman trading vessels and seventeenth century costs that rating fleet a two hour film about the discovery was shown at the British Museum in London yesterday\n\n[noise]\nSo head Egypt and singer Dina Elboghdady tells me about the fan boys that are shows in Cairo there with the world [noise]\n\nWhen John ... thanks for my class today John
