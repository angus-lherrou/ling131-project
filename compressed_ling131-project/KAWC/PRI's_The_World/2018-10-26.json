Concord New Hampshire\nSo\nWe have photos of the fear was ear going door to door on the campaign trail check him out on our Instagram we are\nAnd what do they actually doing they're like what does the normal day of re education at a weaker home look like\nMost of the pond civilians that are coming into the homes are only saying for a period of a week two a month in some cases\nWhere they typically looks like it's a lot of political event there's often flag raising ceremony you go out and you swear allegiance to the Communist Party there's a red songs singing patriotic songs singing activities\nThere's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there is also cultural events that people participate in their drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticence to doing this sort of thing because for a week or is this is um it's not comic activity all of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing they are to participate in Hong cultural activities [noise] one of the things that the manual that the ... billion choose one\nOf the things that they advocate is that you asked the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the legion says of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes do they report on their host to like some higher authority\n[noise] yeah that's one of the primary goal of what they're doing it's it's a fact finding mission so they have these manuals that they're using and their spots and they may knows what they fill out whatever activity they've been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls of the home that sort of thing\nThey're making recommendations as to whether or not the rigors that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education or not\nHow are the leaders reacting to this\nFor many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that they experience it's a it's a pretty extreme form of a journalism a kind of in ...\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space in of their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese weaker languages now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and\nWe were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\nSo how do harm civilians view their roles in this government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who've lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies where\nPopulations were polarized an extreme way and all speech and action was politicized\nSo there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it or something that needs to be done at the central or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pins that had Xi Jinping face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of the patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders like in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer\nKind of enjoying the privilege that they now have\nCertainly are residences echoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations the way they framed their final solution is lasting stability or long term security but it's quite vague we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for it\nLucian is lasting stability or long term security but it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like\nIt seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to the Chinese medium school now but they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society\nSo their position is really quite fraught precarious\nDarren ... is an apology professor at the University of Washington Thank you very much for being with us down it was my pleasure\nKind of feels like it's global campaign season right now Brazil has a presidential runoff this weekend we have those midterms coming up and listen to a accent in Jerusalem are holding municipal elections at the end of the month\nOne candidate there is

the\nPalestinians make up more than a third of Jerusalem's population but they receive far less than their share of city funds and have higher rates of unemployment and poverty then they're Jewish neighbors ... says he's running for city council to try to change that\nThis is a garbage here this is like on both coverage\nHe showed me a vegetable garden and that was part of it on leaving new community center he helped get built when he was the head of disturbed by her neighborhood council now he says it's time to work from the inside to get these kinds of resources for other Palestinian neighborhoods in the city he's created a local party of Palestinian candidates what's the name of your life\nOr the courts rather be stripped sort of is ...\nIf he's elected ... hill improve education

that not white enough sidewalks are thin and in poorer\nRussia's campaign it's controversial here\nMost Palestinians in Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens instead they're legal residents they can vote in municipal elections but the majority choose not to it's a protest of Israel's annexation of their side of the city in Nineteen sixty seven Palestinian see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state\n... he's gotten death threats and he believes Palestinian opponents tried to kidnap his three year old son do you think that was connected to the election\nSo he's taking a quiet approach to the campaign he has no election posters because he's afraid other Palestinians will tear them down instead he speaks in private homes in mosques and an social media and Jeb Bush hired a religious Israeli campaign advisor to open doors in city hall\nThat you wouldn't see for me because I have a my system as it was\nA recent Hebrew University poll found that fifty eight percent of Palestinian surveyed in East Jerusalem agreed that Palestinians should vote for their representatives in municipal elections but speaking to people outside the community center\nSurveyed in East Jerusalem agreed that Palestinians should vote for their representatives in municipal elections\nBut speaking to people outside the community center I Can't find anyone who says for sure\nThey'll cast a ballot as a woman named Sarah do I said the city should get rid of the mice that feed off of raw sewage the INS man next to her nine Solomon says the problem isn't the sewage and mice it's the astronomical cost of building permits but would you vote for Bush\nWas in but I Will not vote and I don't trust anybody he said he should have had these days you can't believe anyone try out ads and the community activists tells me that voting and the Jerusalem election is basically saying you consent to Israel's rule\nAnother Palestinian Aziz Abu Sarah announced a run for Jerusalem mayor earlier this year the world spoke to him in September\nWe cannot only complain about what's wrong here we cannot sit idle we have to do something in accent is given up and we refuse to be an actor\nBut I started ultimately dropped out of the race he says Israeli authorities began questioning his right to maintain his residency status in Jerusalem and he says Palestinians opposed to his run threatened his brother's life ... says he wishes die by ... good luck\nI think if he's able to win he will break the taboo\nI think if he was able to win next election you will see three four or five different
