injured\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league it's believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United states\nThe man accused with carrying out that attack is now facing federal hate crime charges among others charges that could lead to the death penalty we're also learning more about the suspected gunman his trail of anti Semitic posts on social media for example\nThose pose included some but targeted high is the Hebrew immigrant aid society as an organization that provides aid and assistance for refugees of all backgrounds religions\n... is senior vice president with high as a if you don't mind Melanie ... let me just start with your reaction to the attack what were your initial thoughts when you heard about the shooting and also when you learn that\nThe men charged with a shooting at referenced highest your organization on social media\nWell hearing about this shooting as a Jewish person and as an American you know kind of law not surprising was still shocking so I'm trying to process that information\nAnd to hear about that deadly attack on a synagogue was the first shock that we got this weekend and then just about a half hour later having\nReceived the information about the treat about highest I'm honestly we're still processing that\nI mean the tweet I'm not sure it was on Twitter but the man charged with the attacker wrote a on a social media platform highest likes to bring invaders Emma kill our people I can sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in I mean that is really eerie\nThat statement contain so much misinformation that I think people really need to understand what highest and other refugee resettlement agencies do and what our role in is in this in this country the U.S government brings in refugees the U.S government identified people abroad they were twenty five million refugees around the world\nSixty five million displaced people overall is the highest level in recorded history and the U.S government offered safety to a tiny fraction of those people and then agencies like highest and other national resettlement agencies\nSmoked which our

Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has also been talking about as he prepares to move back to a city he was called home New York\nThat reality is about how you as a nation still have a power to accept a difference still have an edgy are still\nYoung enough to take the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart\nBut what if that American Heart grow smaller asks I way way we'll get to that in a few minutes I waited name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism\nBefore that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring to summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book captures some of those times it's called I weigh Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand three in several photos he documents the final days of his father I Ching what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel\nYou feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh and maybe that's a moment you want to act\nSo that's really a psychologically prepared and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us a story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society ... have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he wants the same generation is a state leaders ... drawn islands of people\nThat were together but uh but he was heavily criticized the artist in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble ocean\nOr part of the roof and by the late ... of course have being kicked out or from a party or unpaid revolution\nAnd uh spend about ... years so yeah I well not allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public so the memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there\nAnd that means you're you're part of it is a\nRevolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me against his will so I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said to your father doesn't just beyond your family you know which is very\nThe flack did they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just in Ontario family\nWhich is very good argument and they say a recent belongs to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a ... is ... to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they took being covered by that piece of read but I think it was this Hummer and cause that sickle said cool yeah I'm right\nIf I mean it's brutal hurts me and then there were the flowers flowers in this kind of Sarah money they owe you same said to have a paper flowers you know if someone you spend the next day or a week later somebody dies the oh yeah yeah yeah same\nI I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use and isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I said that while buys a fresh ours my father's point his art has seen he heath life ... much relate to the highest static\nDocument on a moral judgment so I said I have to change it\nSo they send out a A R people the ball ... all the ... forest in Beijing city well I Know they made a fresh for bad so he can sleep or in the middle but still covered by this red blankets\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed teaching dynasty porcelain Anna ... dynasty earn and you were a photograph smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action is ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public know was not possible you'll have no path for\nThe rest of society is in the sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger at the Hong Kong's skyline\nAppointing middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nJust so sad that survey ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl older you know [noise] and the U.S individual in this society what I was kind of do I mean it's just ...\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't race sinks outweigh you know on the surfing on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights but deeply\nUs also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nTo the end of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have a power to accept the difference\nMoved to the time of the reality is about how you as a nation stew have full power to accept a difference to have an energy or\nDo young enough to take the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then there will push people away they'll blame other people and it just shows that we've come to us\nAnd if a big heart starts to shrink while you're here you're going to turn your eye and your critics toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe on to the u._s.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and uh humor I I don't see God to only as a Chinese problem is universal problem\nI weigh thank you very much for your time it was an honor and a great pleasure to meet you thank you nice to be here [noise] check out my selfie with our way and the really cool thing about it I wait till good because you know skill you can see it at the world dot O. R. G. [noise]\nHow much of the ... frozen or not frozen ... is an eco system ecologist and she's in researching Arctic plants here an obvious goes Sweden for the last six years she hasn't pushed the proven to the soil very far at all before it hit something\nSomething that sounds like a big rock and a lot of soul she pulls the pro back out and then if you touched it\nWow it really really called ... ...\nIn just a few seconds or the end of the whole has become so cold that it's uncomfortable to touch it owns eerie like a pick up a message for us from a hidden world right under our feet the world of permafrost\nIt can be anywhere from a meter to a kilometer sick it can be very very cold or just barely frozen an all around the Arctic it's starting to thaw\nYou might have seen some of the pictures roads that are sinking in buckling homes shifting and cracking and trees tilting at awkward angles giving rise to the label drunken forests in fact there's a line of telephone poles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them looks a little drunk and to\nThat one that is kind of tilting now that it probably standing in an area where the ... is just disappearing out so they will have to redo\nThat so for people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store food it becomes nature's freezer now people can't always trust that their food won't spoil\nAnd thawing permafrost affects all of the newer kind of infrastructure to not only buildings water mains sewage dreams even cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shifts beneath them but ... says permafrost it's important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and that material in the ... it's that old like it it's made out of material from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material had a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and start [laughter] she saw\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are is firing so they are breathing basically and then they emit\nCarbon micro breath that we have to worry about\nBasically [laughter] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated and flew up into the atmosphere as messing or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them signed speeds them backup\n\nAt the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty home made because\nUpside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe way we make them flowed disposable using poodles things from Houston swimming pool\n[laughter]\nSo you take your phone will turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases and bubbling up from the lake below Matilda road that's up to another trial and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe and his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas [noise]\nSo we have but so middle leaders of gosh so just used to be ... in the leg sediments a word from the bubble and the global travel through the water and sewage up no insurance\nThey likely captured a mixture of gases\nMost of which are well look you know but we're not sure so we used to love from the measure the actual incoming freshmen\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubbles trapped on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of a multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups that scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand it just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon book stores here from for us we're trying to figure that out\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now\nWe have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine that we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up\n[noise] [noise]\nIf you have a warming of one degree that make all the different than the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because then many ah thresholds that you might cross there a\n... a very says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon and in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of really large exchanges then it can have really dramatic consequences\nIf not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people when they think about how much it will just if you had to pull it back it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving species because if it gets much warmer\nLike the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat and where we live it's just not adapted to that [noise]\nDon't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nCarbon from frozen Arctic soils that we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just built on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger that huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations and\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop the six fearing that we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out\nNow we have an ability to stop [noise]\nOf course we do we have choices and\nI think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nAnd one of the ways is to try and understand his experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we already know which is stuff putting so much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\nYou know I I think we have a responsibility I simply cannot for\nThe world in me Martin obvious skills fleet in [noise]\nAmy's reporting comes to us through our partnership with the
