how that starting to change it's a story we've been focusing on this week here on the world\nToday reporter Sam eaten visits with some of the people who lived in the forest pretty much forever and who in some places are the last line of defense against deforestation\nYou might well have heard the sound of a chain saw in a story about Amazon deforestation a thousand times but this chain saw in the Brazilian state of Maryland yo isn't being used to cut down trees being used to destroy wouldn't timber holler used by a band of illegal loggers [noise]\n... as a member of the Amazon squandered jar a tribe and the leader of an armed group of indigenous forest protectors called the guardians of the forest illegal logging inland clearing continue to eat away at the world's largest remaining tropical forest\nBut the Guardian's and others like them in Brazil are pushing\nBack [noise]\nOn a recent David summer ... and the Guardian's prepare to patrol the ... river a narrow strip of muddy water marking the boundary of the glass jar is seven hundred square mile forest reserve the land is protected on paper but it's under constant threat\nAnd and that they thought it was ... if we go looking

whatever out there what we want the forest it's ... it's a wealth that extends far beyond the glass jars land and even the rest of the Amazon indigenous groups protecting

heavily armed policemen arrive\nWe entered the forests of the river and head of the past with assault rifles and vote proof vest checking for trip wires and booby traps [noise] before long we find a planted field but it's not hot ... planted by land grabbers after they cleared the trees for charcoal [noise]\nGuardians cut and burn that can solve a with a forest will take decades to recover\nKilled off the walls of shows like sometimes when we see the trees cut down the cellar says we feel rage but we also have a heart so sometimes we pity the outsiders to yeah we'll we'll ... we'll follow their they wrecked what they had to fill the satellite and now they want to wreck what we have\nThousands of social media accounts that are coordinating their activity either because they're automated like botnets or their little armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly and as broadly as possible\nUm and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assume that they're just kind of hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on\nTheir foreign policy objectives but what's interesting is that when there is a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S like the Kavanaugh nomination for example they do turn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we found twenty sixteen\nAre these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile for example the crews ... Senate race in Texas right well there is a lot of social media engagement around that rates and there are some tactics\nBeing used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done\nWhat we're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are hoping a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and obvious gate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections\nTactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and obvious gate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the better and the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course that's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to\nExacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S\n[noise] they are and I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity of any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative or one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify disorders manipulative\nDistribution [noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nI think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually won in the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr you know what are the rules of the road in terms of this ongoing combat between nations that are sometimes friends and sometimes adversaries\nDonovan Morgan is a CEO of new
