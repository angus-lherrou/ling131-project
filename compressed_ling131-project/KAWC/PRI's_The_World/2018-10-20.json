[noise]\nThe wind also smashed buildings in piles of member and flipped over cars is for roofs off of airplane hangar\nAnd damaged esque twenty two stealth fighter jets worth more than three hundred million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change and all their installations Brian ...\nWrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency we think it's important to capture the distinction between the normal\nMaintenance repair versus the closer coinage of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\n... or ... it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof and you know how much you've spent repairing hang our roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition it's not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that was correct\nTrevor how there is with the economic research company radium group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because uh\nSpecific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more main felt during hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nRight down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is sort of given building a experiences extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price goes\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable I mean I don't\nKnow exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them wash than you know half of a wing of one of six getting fighter\nA department of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facility to address whether an environmental conditions by climate change planning doesn't have a specific budget line however they say they're currently reviewing their climate resilience policies for the world Carolyn Beeler\nAnd selling to provide houses details meant they had to pay the highest rate vibe here or the day or child for the school meals\nFamilies would also required to pay two hundred and ten years for child each quarter for the school bus and many obviously the Ford to do so with talking about migrants will sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten\nYears [noise] so what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how did they get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing a ... he's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution and convinced they were totally aware my grandchildren will be forced to eat separately from their classmates\nThat was his older load that prevent kids from bringing their own food from home inside the class obviously was a problem for their parents because they were forced to take their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back\nSo they had to do that come forward from the house to school like three or four times a day to provide their ... some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\nThere was a reporter for ... for many tidy MTV program for first report that the case and they went to low income from some of the seats and ... asking them what are you to think of the ...\nAnd you know well they were pretty happy with it because they proceed migrants invaders but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge an equally and as I say first Soviet any support that there is a dish should\nBut then when he figured it out that a massive crew finding to help the migrant kids had already raise\nSixty thousand euros you said that a ... of assets without being an off to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way\n[noise] [noise] yes there is a decision as being described as an op are tied as a form of segregation or that he's feeling that we are going seriously to fire\nBut thank you ... are now studying just seeing that you know this is probably the most far right governments in the end of the world war second in Italy for sure and maybe ... ... you\nKnow for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother ... she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt you know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed\nAnd humiliated by a little sign by politicians were totally aware of the conditions for migrants in low ... so they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration\nBecause often they are invisible in equally\nInterior minister motel solving supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of loaded also backtracked no she\nKnow she didn't she said that she will come see either so stuffed if he\nAs I said has the mayor of ... also backtracked\nNo she didn't know she didn't she said that she will concede or sell stuffed if he ... the ... as a way to guarantee school meals the kids but she said that she doesn't have to drop the rest of the\nGuardian reporter ... thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of the TV show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show\nIn this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess visa overstay errors or people who are working against the terms of of their views in Japan needs to take out people you're there with them in the car\nUm they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggests there deport him in the next plane type\nThing wow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or a translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a title no she can kind of which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada Brian from for example uh we had a show like this that uh Canada border services agency cooperated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton cousin so now the the immigration agents are on their way to a\nDormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in a minute sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there is a a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road ... it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably can plane in ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurred out images you can't see people's spaces voices are describes it's quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be\nUm because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they leave I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\n[noise] well I mean yeah I like on line there was considerable backlash from\nShow in Japan or what have active it's been saying\n[noise] well I mean yeah at least on line there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said our age rating those into the entertainment\nLike why why you showing people being deported how can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\n[noise] well I mean I guess it'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases\nAbout people from other countries have a they don't speak our language they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'd much rather like a I think it's just kind of aware of sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you you might think also we live within time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for Brexit or invasion of Crimea so maybe people are just feeling I'm\nLess secure in their own country is so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that someone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show\nOh You're welcome was great to
