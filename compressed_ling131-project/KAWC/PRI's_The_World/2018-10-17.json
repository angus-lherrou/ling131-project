S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated and family was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or bits of fleeing that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law and then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico\nAnd signs of that it's safe for them to wait there\nWe also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport the asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law and international law so there were these three interlocking policies\nAnd since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come just asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian ... says Amnesty International was president and

grandson with special needs before being deported back to Brazil\nThe implication was all of a sudden fame some merit less right so you're saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you with your grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here it's a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson\nAt the threat of being deported without him\nAnd what we saw in terms of both the grandmother and the grandson\nIs it the long term consequences are great she actually had a medical emergency\nWhere she had to be rushed to the hospital because of health deteriorated so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented in court and still they prolonged her attention finally actually it was only when a congressperson peso O'Rourke got involved that she was released in the it'll took to reunite with her grandson\nWhere our Maria and her grandson today there in Connecticut he's still under state custody she was seeking to move from weekend visits to having guardianship over him again but she had to\nGo through the bureaucratic hoops while she also appeals for asylum claim I spoke with her a few weeks ago\nAnd she said you know I Need to go to a psychologist an scars of deep I forget what it was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've
