cut the doctor for a kind of pushed around [noise]\nOurs mumbled across a smaller number should but the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen ... meters a year I don't know if I was rather strange so a little less ...\nHis research led him to the third character in the story ... ... is an astronomer he's retired now but he used to work at the University of Iceland\nOr too much pressure to use the effect of a sudden on the earth\nAnd he told them it was true the Arctic Circle is moving and that's because the axis of the earth is moving slowly racking up and down between twenty two and twenty four and a half degrees foreseen says this movement happens in a predictable cycle\n... forty thousand years twenty thousand years in one direction twenty thousand years back\nIt's called ... and it changes the amount of the planet that goes into total darkness and total daylight every year when the earth's axis gets closer to straight up and down the Arctic Circle shrinks when it gets more tilted circles spreads out\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away agreements he is currently don't only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd that's drawn tourists here for decades and that Steve ... describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is that it was assigned the maid of honor minimum un thoughts were the unload the tourists will there ever been to go walk from around the sly and give them is a difficult and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker would do for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christians said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year but stores team told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that\nAn average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch grin the for a few more decades\nIs heading north to leave the island and looking forward to show that it would be if you go through those are more\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved ... than usual this is true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make\nSure they could ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument and the same old place or it could let this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt guest they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so I Would of senior leaders to sort of on the move\n... ... years old and you sure this is true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make\nThey could ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place or it could let this new information we shave their whole idea for the monument says you've no doubt gas they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than the nice easy fiction [noise]\nSo so I Would think that there's two ...\nAlternatives only move so ... says different ways of representing those moments and then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a whole because it's something you can move around it also represents\nWhat we're all because everything that we're talking about was thinking about is on she affected bibles\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also it's something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents certain physicality sit and wait\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo is bigger than us you know there was the thing that we realize that has to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms wrapped it even if five people like the ... the ... they'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow unlike now even though we know he's going north this summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction ruined house when I first to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn is through certain things are all going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nLooks out there's one doctor comes into the wrong people remember finger burger of Arthur's the movements of the U.S crush this is somebody we can't produce very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another ranch in the works\nI have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers it seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have across and everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories it's actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that\nAnd then we have to decide if we're gonna take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories it's actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that\nSo let's take a quick look first of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now it's happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades and the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not trapped more heat this is a fact\nSo we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be when it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool [noise]\nThis is a moving to ... to ... which which is nothing you can touch or see and that's interesting because the object is following this idea\n\nThe ball is the least important thing about the piece itself is the movement bought the book does is it represents a movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work that way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature just stood there occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything will ever be taking a shorter\nEven it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ... of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in the year twenty forty seven\nI'm not spending Christian and I go up there with all my friends and kick it into the ocean\n[laughter] what it says Walker agreeing [laughter]\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic the answer anything above the ... line which fluctuate between sixty five and a half and sixty eight degrees north which is so messy and complicated there's really nothing about the Arctic that oh these are rules\nFor the world I'm Amy Martin
