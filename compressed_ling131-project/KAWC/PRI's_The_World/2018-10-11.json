Trump\nToday Trump attacked the plans that some Democrats to expand Medicare to include everyone Trump called that socialism here's a quote the new Democrats are radical socialist who want to model America's economy after Venezuela which got us wondering about the word socialism and how politicians use it\nPatrick ... theory reports on language for us so people in the right Patrick of long attack their opponents for being socialists what's different than how Trump use the word today\nWas funny you know this in a way there's nothing different from what people have been saying for decades about socialism like basically it was just to stand in for communism right\nNow though some of like the politicians on the left or right she embracing socialism you think of bunny son does New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez they identify a social or what a socialist me\nThe Democratic socialist value for me I Believe that in modern\nMoral society now for the last [noise]\nSanders a cause of Cortez they use the term democratic socialist what what does that tell us like because it kind of a branding their socialism away from Marcus revolution and communism as you were saying\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and it's weird because to somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you know I'm used to hearing about political parties during the Cold War who called themselves socialist or at least they openly supported socialist finally as\nAnd nobody was espousing monsters revolution I Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist you might as well it's just been a Soviet spy it's like socialism with the political third\nRow yeah right I mean even the way Trump use the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the nights\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and it's weird because if somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you

revolution I Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist he might as well it's just been a Soviet spy like socialism was a political third\nRail yeah right I mean even the way Trump used the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy witch hunt so what kind of support does socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support does it have in the U.S right now\nWell I think we'll get some clues from the results in the mid ...\nBut there are other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking social in some form of frequently than they used to the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who was a relatively young conservative commentator he was barely alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nAnd they frame socialism as you know the opposite of capitalism\nCapitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialism is Danica socialism is charity not an aspect of journey socializing itself is hearing\nAlso Marco those ... democratic socialist of America on the eve of Donald Trump's election them membership was less than

getting to work on that naval station how to do not with a military site but with infrastructure outside of the military base\nThere's been some funding authorized for helping military readiness when
