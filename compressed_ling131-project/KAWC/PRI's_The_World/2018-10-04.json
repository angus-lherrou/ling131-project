for judges over there\n[noise] yes well this is a country which had its backers of appointment of judges and they mostly happened a long time ago so the English civil war of the seventeenth century\nWas the midpoint of a century of struggles and at that point the judge it served at the pleasure of the king so the king could dismiss them at any time so when parliament became more powerful it's pasta framework and Seventeen hundred and in that act that settlement it provided that they could no longer dismiss them\nInteresting the lead to some of the change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system and in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the monarch bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it and there were some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't committed crimes that\nType of behavior which was driven by their CEO dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointments still the situation\nSuddenly enough that not a lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was like that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age that I'm a ... ... ... and that's one of the most famous English Czechoslovakian and\nThe leading judge of the twentieth century started expressing some very a socially conservative views and books he was writing and\nThe feeling was that if judges were going to do this or that hunter edge they could bring the reputation of the courts into district periods so retirement age was introduced it currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nI guess they have so there are exceptions but they are\nVery uh socially conservative views and books he was writing and the feeling was that if judges were going to do this and that ... edge they could bring the reputation of the courts into district ... so a retirement age was introduced it currently Seventy\n[noise] I mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa and they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nAt yes they have so there are exceptions but there are three ...\nIsland states where judges are typically brought in on a contract basis for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to one side so it's striking that\nThere's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming little countries with their heritage that the u._s. system also sheds\nSo here I Am a little confused about where the U.S sits right now so if you consider the systems of judicial appointments or in the countries you've looked at and compare them to the current state of affairs in the U.S [noise] what'd you say the U.S is behind the times\nI I wouldn't say the heightened time for its drugs which and wrote back and how scrutiny even accept me as some kind of what part of the time but I what I Do want to highlight is the\nIssue of retirement that we've been speaking about that is an area in which we've seen that the U.S had been left behind with other countries have introduced the time and it just\nEnded and another problem that we haven't talked about yet is\nThe pressure on individual CIA [laughter] decide when to retire so Justice Kennedy made a very important decision when he retired now like any of us he's been title to stop working back that far more consequences\nBecause it is and whether the retirement age a more predictable in that way and led tension between president governments on the one side and judges on the other side to side whether to yield\nThe seats on the court to\nThe government of the day that will be choosing the next nominee\nI'll never forget a Thurgood Marshall a retiring from the court and a reporter asked him on the steps of the Supreme Court why argue stepping down and he said because I'm\nOld [laughter] that
