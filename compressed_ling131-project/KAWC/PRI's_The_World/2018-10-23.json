American teams because there was no league in Mexico for them and then last year he bought a helped launch Mexico's first professional women's soccer league\nHer reputation was well known a tireless advocate for girls and women and sports\nLast month you brought up was kidnapped her friends didn't know what happened and then he bought it was found dead near to want out last week\nMental economy

women who are comment you try and fresh no football in this country comes food\nShe was born in and get it in a couple of Republican spent many days into her telephone you're anti or whatnot and was

are now in each state study meaningful and ... and they can and injustice that my dad got a\nReporter and you know the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered Nina thank you very much for telling us about might have a a math problem thank Cape\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist Jamal ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate and assemble as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and we'd be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that\nClip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs\nThere hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some deal they had made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said uh the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nOr things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murders regime that's not only kill the journalist is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and raise the on you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages so not all of us have gone through but uh Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars\nSome of that money has already slowed then started delivering the fifteenth so the money as water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might change is the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they've got to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military has built on us in UK supplied weapons communications maintenance and spare parts\nSaudi Arabia's whole military has built on us and you had supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts they would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that has weapons and then the Saudi piece as a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places\nWhere a particular bomb is built on a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually are totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people and the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nWilliam Hartung the director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy in Washington thanks very much for explaining this to thank you\nThis is Kelly any walk to factor mattered because the church and the\nBureau of Indian affairs school is built any mock heads the ... circuit polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage but she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island\nHer ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new school or risk having them taking away\nOver time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions but the sticking point was money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated inexpensive affair one federal study pegged the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water\nBut Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real\nFinding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some good money and some grant program spun up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change\nClimate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ... and he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because you you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a whiff of climate change to it has to stop\nThen a few months later Clements got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of a purge\nFound a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote in\nBeen reassigned I realized that it was I was part of the purge\nClement found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll just saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's gonna happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great [noise]\n\nI reached out twice to the department of the interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents to go somewhere else no more fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which is horrible [noise]\nEveryone I met in ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essentials of life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends\nOn keeping those relationships intact\nBloated will start to take her or or ... for an hour or so laugh you know such a were real\nThis is Stan Lee talked to the vice mayor of such a rough\nHundred were community you know it come from families that are really good there's communities like a real big firmly\nStanding on a search and rescue team here and he knows

completely ineffective and helping them to get out now that it's clear they need to relocate\nFor American through and over a ... to to go toward ruined country\nLimit said that we're likely to lose
