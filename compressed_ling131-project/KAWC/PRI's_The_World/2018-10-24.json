S. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes they conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S those claims have no evidence by the way\nThe Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one Danielle ... is a former spokesman and president Enrique Pena Nieto's government he's now a political consultant\nBeyond says Mexico's government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ... ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you\nAnd also recall and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders on you're you're only allowed but on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion of Mexico's saying hey guys we should treat the Central America as as we require the Americans with treats our Mike Rounds up on the north\n[noise] what about right now we're seeing Mexican police in riot gear some of them look like they're ready to go to battle what rights to the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLook that for decades Mexican southern border there has to be very ...\nMeaning that we have like four years hundreds of thousands of immigrants from South and Central America traveling from Mexico\nWe have heavily invested in the country now we're southern border there to provide more facilities for legal crossing and to provide humanitarian be set for those probably to the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed aboard or did you see that as a serious effort or just for ...\nWhat I see that Mexican police work or not they were having the shells and and the guy says but they were not carrying guns because that was the limit they said like they didn't want ... these ... these clashes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants that they want it to 'cause they forcing them back south\nThey could do that my guess is that they Mexican on Thursday we'll try to negotiate with them in order for them to apply for humanitarian be says\nDaniel how do you think most Mexicans view the Central Americans passing through Mexico right now are are they welcoming them would they accept them if they were to stay\nOn the one hand you'll see that a lot of people like come on people even like working class people trying to have a immigrants providing them with\nFood shed there and what they're used to be not do their own country for\nDecades we were the country that receive so many Europeans\nParticularly Spaniards fleeing from CBS wires and World War two but you'll still see some sectors in the Mexican society saying these people are coming to steal our jobs for Mexico is not so easy just to ignore or scrapped\nThe U.S points of view in this issue\nWe are countries that are heavily dependent upon each other Fifteen hundred billion dollars per year trade but the other hand Mexican public opinion they are not happy with the fact of the government just taking orders from another government\nMm So the Mexican taking orders from the White House in Washington is ...\nJust taking orders from another government ... so the Mexican taking orders from the White House in Washington is ... is a political consultant in Mexico city who's also a former spokesman in the government of president Enrique Pena Nieto\nDanielle thank you for your time to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThey've been receiving those ages twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent and twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region we wanted to know what that it actually goes to their appears as with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use for a wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity\nThis is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of it in a company and child migrants arrived at our southern border President Obama at that\nTime and knowledge that\nIn order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to flee and and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity in those countries and strengthen institutions because there's a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our\nOur major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to\nTo end so regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala hundreds in El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries have really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nAnd Sarah how political do see this move being is this something that Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when in the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms\nSo this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country to quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala of about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country in Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognized that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think well it will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\n... to to take this on anything\nFast really looking at that as I find to file and like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for saying that I find today are silenced and including changing a silent for individuals who are applying at I bought it like this cat and so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone and the cat and a pie faith island they'll likely be placed in our immigration quite backlog\nWhich catches on for years so that they waiting in the United states and the way down the line and immigration quite that you'll have to pick up that case and started from scratch and see if it's in the in the air I found an application\nIn reality we like to the ... and more efficient fifth and operating at the ... that way when working
