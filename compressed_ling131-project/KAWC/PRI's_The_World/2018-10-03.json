Philadelphia\n[noise] if there's a few minutes to spare there's always time for some of my favorite music afro beat ... he was a pioneer I think you'd be pleased that in the wake of his death just over Twenty years ago a bunch of fellow inspired afro be bad seemed to material was\nThe Brooklyn based underground system for example there's a band lead singer Dominican for ... [noise]\nSome of you off of the lovers or fill up with the lovers might already noticed that our name underground system is based off of a say last last\nAlbum before he passed away called underground system and it was kind of an ... to have one of the group started [noise]\nThe music of fed up with the egg came into the sound of undergone system basically because my cold leader Peter maps and who is actually the one who started the band really loved afro beat loved the music of failure and\nWithin five months he saw me performed with another I felt the ban is led by the thing of on the bottom of a mile and\nHe asked me would you like to join us in just play a couple of songs on flutes may be seeing a fast song and I said sure and I really enjoyed it a lot and I became more involved\nAnd started working with him as a co director and partnership with the band [laughter]\n\nOne of the songs that album that high of and I also besides all what are you which is the title track of the albums you\nKnow [laughter]\n\nSong is a pretty personal song for me as well as for the ban but for me it's a question that has asked often because I'm multiracial African American Italian\nIt's hard for the band bad for me it's a question that is awesome often I'm multiracial African American e tallying\nAnd I think a lot of people see an ethnic and be ready and so they don't know how to I wanted to ethnicity or\nWhere are you from they once they ask what are you which is a very strange question the gift\n\nA year's progress the bouncer some started changing personnel and and experimenting with different found the kind of became more influence with the new wave\nTold this cold five and so and combining everything\nThat we listen to living in New York City in the underground dance scene\nIt kind of came up with the sound that we use with the album [noise]\nAmerica for the of the afro be banned underground system telling about their new album what are you [noise]\nWe as the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a crisis right in front of us and what brings down great empires past and future is that and there's really nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS one he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb\nAnd Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much double the dead since he's been in office and somebody's got to pay a big price we have to start shopping that that down\nBut once Obama was out and Trump was in the Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget\nToday the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by itself\nWherever the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable I'm a big problem and we're the only advance economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason ferment at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally the U.S is sandwiched between ... and Jamaica were carrying are heavy debt load since World War two\nEconomists say when you're in a time of recession it's time to spend to get the economy going again when the economy is roaring along as it is now it's a good time to save says Chris Edwards he's the director of tax policy studies at the K to Institute a libertarian think tank in Washington\nThe Republican Party I used to be a ... outside of the national defense areas or the party of spending restraint but they no longer are you don't hear anything about strength\nSpending restraint from major Republican leaders and the fact that we're in the tent here of an economic expansion now and that keeps rising is really extraordinary and very irresponsible\nUnless Congress fundamentally changes the path\nOf its path we are headed for a Greek type crisis\nBut what exactly could that mean\nThe rising a debt ah you know could could create this crisis situation where interest rates a spike the government has to take drastic actions perhaps you know cutting benefits a Social Security and other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings evaporate could that happen in the United states of America\nMark gold wind doesn't see us as the next Greece but he does think we should be paying more attention to the debt one of the scary thing about that as we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is a senior policy director with the nonpartisan things\nThe things about that is we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is a senior policy director with the nonpartisan think tank\nThe committee for a responsible federal budget I don't think we're headed for Greek like crisis because unlike Greece we borrow in our own currency and we can actually make her own party but I Do believe that our current path is unsustainable\nAnd I do believe that if there isn't a course correction at some point um we will face a financial crisis who actually potentially create a global financial crisis that is not as bleak\nAs a full scale Greek crisis bordering on anarchy Jason vermin at Harvard doesn't think either of those scenarios is likely he served as chair of President Obama's council of economic advisors and says the dead should've never been our number one issue in the first place\nBut I don't think it should drop off the list of concerns entirely either\nWhen it comes to the United states dead right now he says he subscribes to the termites in the word work theory\nThat every year they chip away at your prosperity a little bit and leave you a little bit worse off but without ever thing ever being really dramatic\nStill after a while your house we'll need to be fixed and continually delaying repairs we all know that's going to cost you for
