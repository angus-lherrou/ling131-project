S. and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota ... voter id law what does that law say it basically\nSays that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't a lot about\nMost of the people who live on reservations don't actually have a a a physical street address they use pill boxes\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law what can people on reservations in North Dakota do uh coming up on midterms but\nYou know they can they can give them a general treated your street address 'em through the uh the native council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI I'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than

against the war in Yemen\nUm these are part of the functions of being an artist and a something that I I put a lot of good faith in\n... as an actor an activist he's involved with the stand and vote campaign an effort to get the vote out among Native Americans in North Dakota thank you so much mark thank you so happy to talk to you [noise]\nThese this week is that China and Russia has been routinely eavesdropping on President Trump's phone conversations what are the parallels with what happened to uncover Merkel\nThere certainly are some parallels I mean what sort of different about the reporting is that's a ... it was almost like how could are good friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to people\nOff the record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff goes on all the time we know that all major countries eavesdropping spy on one another but they shouldn't be doing in such open and crass ways\nThat seems to have gotten a bit last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing\nThat he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody it hasn't generated nearly as much heat as say the letter bomb soil which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here without saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension um that's generating a lot more passionate a lot more heat than the thought that somewhat it's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and eternal is from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over ... and that kind of thing I mean how how your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think it's\nA love affair slowly slowly let's start from our prime minister

the child or she seemed\nTo kind of educate them in the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to the stream ... by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know now that he respects the very very much the situation of the relationship\nBetween the two countries I think is um it's quite good\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin\nI I Would pretty much agree with that I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or attention here probably as much as we command their attention there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know I'm a little medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like victim all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal which puts the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nAll bond and hungry you know I'm a going out for a meal with the prime minister reaches probably walk in the book\nYou've already just another part I'm sure the
