massive sabotage of our country's defense is by people hacking into them it's a size five scenario but it may not be that far from reality\nThat at least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems could be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field think about the

defense systems Emily drives us has been covering this for wired Emily weapon system at the center of this report\n[noise] very good an unanswerable question actually this report is written it is an unclassified report but these weapons weapons systems are themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves named\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing [noise] wow [noise]\nSo so what kind of vulnerabilities did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that\nBasically an entire generation of Pentagon weapon seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers to take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into this and some of these things were just that they found be fault

Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are\nOnly for high level hackers\nTo take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into this than some of these things were just that they found default password hadn't changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing password\nIn one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases\nThe DOD weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nI think the biggest thing is that I think there was a sense from a lot of people in the world that patients were bystanders in their own disaster\nAnd actually being there and seeing the way that people came together and then ultimately took charge of their own rebuilding in their own reconstruction really showed me\nThe way in which that completely backwards the best thing that foreigners can do is a fifth people in their own effort and then kind of get out of the way and I think one of the most important things that we can do is respect that and try to help without

Ontario for a very long time for\nOur family has been on this piece of land says Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has a ... a lot and then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduated college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch it twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures they're outside\nThe caller that they have on them [noise] his id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures for room in the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well it measures are lying down time and measures her activity\nCombine that technology with better breathing and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management each farm\nHas a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump Canada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kick in as part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much for growth in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts I don't know and so he said we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got into his head that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agree with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently read to find some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nA lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and an appropriate time or sold an extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers\nProducts their pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years if not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nA lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time or sold an extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin\nWell us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture we had no right to do that I I really think runs the nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system\nThe U. S. government sets the minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products\nSour cream for instance it so I think if I don't want to go to ...\nGrams Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S Eric ... is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and I have like fifty percent tariffs Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics Wisconsin\nBeing a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process [noise]\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement to address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nFeel I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what happened is lunar her a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York from or see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo Canadian markets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and has not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what happened to have\nThought I thought I'm at the Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new ... like him she live outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or\nEven just simple critics of what's going on that area for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to radio for more than a year now let's say and that would get anything\nAs far as I can tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and\nSo this showed a lack of understanding of the government itself of what is independent truckers because there isn't anything called independent John let them in Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified are you a thought he did that and it was like no\nProfile of something that's been going on ... for more than a year now let's say ... scary thing\nIs also a tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and\nSo this showed a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent trouble with that because there isn't anything called independent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissident and it's like no I'm a journalist\nWas covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can have these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this\nIs the problem with with with how the Saudi Government as healing with everyone right now they are shutting down even my oldest of commenting critique about their policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly\nCongress stories and that they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman a came I kept\nHer absolutely on everyone's ... I mean\nLike ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia and there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we fought like a lot of the activists that had been arrested before the ban was lifted that that would be released by now instead of being really\nLauren ... is a reporter for the verge she covers space learn walk us through what happened yesterday after the Soyuz rocket launch\nSo everything started off completely normal they took off from the buck and you're causing to drown in Kazakhstan at four forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that something had gone wrong with\nThe booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up in flight and that\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence and the capital that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry\nAnd that's when you come in at a much steeper angle when you land on earth so I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and\nUltimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and\nI Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there\nThe astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlifting or could you not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spending and the goal is to a grand jury and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is not the parabolic flight that's when you\nFeel weightlessness for a moment in time and during the ... experience extra D's and it feels like something that's pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused the problem\nI don't know if they've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core\nAnd they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters innocent our core we're when really they are supposed to separate them\nSomething in your field so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused the problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core\nAnd they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters innocent our core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely\nJust won the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] none of us and Russia they're frequently and uh the specially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that NASA has\nBeen kind of shiny beacon of hope and our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military to use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our states infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station I Would say\nIt's definitely concerning about that age and teacher we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and\nThey're going to have to come home eventually\nThey got up there and it's way as as well and the Soyuz capitals can't last forever and or but they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into\nThat so they're slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but\nThat hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen\nIt just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the verge thinks learn things for
