housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm gonna put my key and I'm going to end the room so this particular time you

works she's worried about how speaking out my impact her job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel disgusted angry so I just kinda like bad or just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much and housekeeping where your managers kind of feel like it was just a normal and they just say okay you don't go back to their own today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that gas wasn't there but he was an axe to

born women here in the U.S is housekeeping\nWith nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector for Hoge having the panic button has made her and her staff safer I honestly think is a great

there's such heightened\nAwareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space\nBut I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer that's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International she's talking about the new devices they're rolling out in the U.S and Canada\nBut the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat for us it's a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat can be fined gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nPractices happening here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had a ... they can do it throughout Asia throughout Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year house keepers like Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like this is incredible on my book could do like we we have all had the same family life we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chain have promised to install panic

doing a few searches the investigative news websites building cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. but suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nEric Holder is one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with what we had a little bit\nTo start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex and there may have but before he was ... he was not as Alex in Petra which was he covered that it's totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel and\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birth date um where he had to pass pass where if you're too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere I'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information discover identity from his real I get so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are league um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're just leak the databases\nFrom driver's licenses insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you get to know where to look and say we cross reference everything we could fight\nNorthern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information or discover identity from his real I get so we looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked the databases\nFrom driver's licenses insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you get to know where to look inside cross reference everything we could find and we found a max about a guy named Alex and our ... at the same birth dates and this from roughly the same delegation of mental nowhere\nAnd northern Russia and after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to his tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he went to medical school [laughter] yeah he was he a DJ that the local club one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village\nSo we once these hundreds of these databases across represent the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI go to see some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is a lot of very creative thinking\nThinking of a mini vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all been forged in his head and the way forever but again these guys have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that we tracked back to them so yeah I mean yes maybe some of this is kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research I mean if you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for and interesting details in cross referencing them and see what's um matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the crumbling\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses at the headquarters of the cherry which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on a driver's license the address of the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA well he did it because uh you know if it gets pulled over in his car the cop pulled up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less like oh actually you know everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found as three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nWho all have the same register to address that gift says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all listed their vehicle registration as his address who's I guess I Want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get hold of her drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything it goes down too lazy nuts and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on the news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange slumping as to what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and has been intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation ... Russia people always chime in and saying well they want you to find the\nRight [noise] well if they want us to find a wise no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration traded vehicles and the jury you headquarters [noise]\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agents needs address same like Jerry you address again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this great ball poisoning I have authorities\nInvestigation of Russian people or with China's saying well they wanted you to find the\nRight [noise] well if they want us to find a wife no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registrations for these vehicles and the Jerry ... headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address thing like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\n[noise] a few weeks ago your website ... identified as a second person allegedly involved with this ... poisoning I have is already in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] uh no no no not really I mean I don't really have any in I don't think Elliot our founder has contacts ... either [noise] um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe it's all completely news that we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know I have no idea I've never worked had intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some way but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site billing cats together with their partners that the insider and I said they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former rushing saw Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia and the u._k. back in March and", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "10"}
