I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that everywhere on our cable or people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes are low tides of the enormous beaches\nOr the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had ... grade the Cape cod seashore national monument so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds early sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state huh cod wailing or and\nYou know we don't have cod though I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no God or very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state\nSo what do we need to do today to take care of our oceans I think there were three primary\nChallenges a number one climate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean\nWhich has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world are we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate if in fact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic\nImpact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern the second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build that bill near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nYou I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen in the water and therefore the fish and plants and Fonda in the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I seen film of a shark send or ... or whales dragging net surrounding dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish and that's one of the reasons we don't make cod anymore here\nEight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of the sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones and the others or at or near max so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class\nMax so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi\nOr with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and then therefore appetite we have a huge challenge and already about drugs and the protein that people get the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fish is food stock and increasingly we're going to say pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think you spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... to one there's something called the law the sea treaty with something that the United states and the folks from Massachusetts like Eliot Richardson worked on years ago which we never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty\nUm that would govern what is half of the world is not in any just\nTo correct It's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation\nBut they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fishermen and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drift net fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned but today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing at the drift net is literally thousands of miles a model filament netting that they dropped behind the boat drag allowing it kind of strip mines the ocean\nAnd as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called waste cats they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine if the vision of a you'll see a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address and that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off\nAnd it becomes what we call the ghost in it because it just fishes on its own when it's weighted down with carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic again\nUntil it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat it's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what ships are they're fishing\nSo we're over fishing talk to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nFace a massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands I I just met with them the other day at an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands\nAnd they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe\nThey'll lose their nation state which is these islands\nIncreased fires increased floods more moisture in the air because of the warming of the ocean more intensity and the storms because of that moisture we're seeing it in a hurricane's we've seen last year just three hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria\nCost the taxpayer two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the defense department budget for here think of that three storms and it's going to get worse so people who sit there and say well we can't afford to do something or we can it's crazy it is far more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "09"}
