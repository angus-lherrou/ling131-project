on October tenth it shredded buildings with the sheer force of it category for when and swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it passed through quickly though and drop less\nIs the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it passed through quickly though and drop less rain than other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria [noise]\nOnly the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to a category four in just twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michael thinks the if it's good to be with you\nSo why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and it became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these death\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy in twenty twelve at at a foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge\nMight sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several billion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quite pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warm in warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons\nFrom a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more of these very intense storms this category you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest\nIn fact there's a relationship for a category five storm you\nGet an increase of roughly seven percent in the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed so it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm\nThat's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nYou know the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the the world face\nNo the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal every surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius pulled the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius the better part of one degree Fahrenheit right there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius\nYou have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past uh the PC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual uh numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I criticize this latest report for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back to their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened make that that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius\nWe hope you'll be with us for hearing now tomorrow morning from
