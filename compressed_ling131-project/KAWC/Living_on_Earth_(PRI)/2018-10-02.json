series looking at how Puerto Rico was recovering after Hurricane Maria laid waste to the island in September of twenty Seventy\nWe've looked at the resiliency of the corals before the drinking water system and the people themselves now living on her body to ask them checks in on the farming sector she went to Puerto Rico nine months after the storm but some small farmers who lived through it and we're still working to rebuild\nEven before Hurricane Maria uprooted trees and people Puerto Rico imported roughly eighty five percent of Its Food after the storm that number shut up to Ninety five percent imported food if you could get it many people are forced to skip meals and each shelf stable and canned food for months\nNine months after the storm one of the only places to find locally grown food on the island is farmers' markets like the Saturday market and ring tone and Puerto Rico's what have\nYou on a dinosaur kill dinosaur kill how's that Sunday\nCarlos nearby farm is slowly recovering storm today she's brought pineapple a pie a mushroom and account she's explaining to a customer\nNew supervisor view on both of them I like to which the single little for three to five I think um [noise] I'll say those are not one of the things you suddenly as\nBrave smile makes our natural sales person says pretty it's a good time to be at the market right now\nSo that things are just starting to turn around for her family and the farm they're finally harvesting again and her farm to table restaurant sana open just a few weeks ago\nBut Hurricane Maria was devastating for them the storm destroyed her home she had to send her three children to Florida to live with family while she and her husband living in their car rebuilt the battered farm\nWell we got really trashed on of our production for years of tropical trees like mango trees and passion for cheese they all died and they all would learn way we had a cheese that were a hundred years old and I you know totally perish\nJust a hurricane will decide to own it brought some salt water and um some fan with it so everything that was going to pass it looked like it through herbicides\nAcross the island tall for cheese for the most heavily damaged food crop\nRoot vegetables that could hiding underground did OK grass plants like pineapple were among the first to recover and fast growing vegetables like salad greens are easy enough after the hurricane visitors came to Puerto Rico with our suitcases full of seeds to donate to farmers Sonya says they actually put it\nYou know totally perished since the hurricane was assigned to own it brought some salt water and um some fan with it so everything that was going to pass it looks like it's through herbicides\nAcross the island tall fruit trees for the

easy enough after the hurricane visitors came to Puerto Rico with our suitcases full of seeds to donate to farmers\nSonya says they actually started growing again relatively quickly\nBut we still don't have electricity we couldn't pump water out and we didn't have any gas so it was we were able to grow food because we have gas to pull out the water from the water pumps and we just\nYou know trying to scrape up any anything waiting ten hours for guys just grow food and it's very uncertain\nGrocery stores are open and got on the island but visit a grocery store and Puerto Rico and you'll be hard pressed to find anything supplied by local farmers I went shopping and Amigo chain grocery store which\nIs owned by Wal Mart\nThe bears pineapple from Costa Rica coconuts from Dominican Republic\nHoneydew melon from Guatemala [noise] overhead is more of a watermelon Trump supporter I found some watermelon from Puerto Rico isn't one around that are already cut up into pieces the whole

U.S initiative called operation bootstrap\nWould the colonization of the U.S there was a movement to get people out of their farms and into the city is\nA ... my shell is the documentarian for the resilience funds in Puerto Rico\nScientists focused on how divergent species inherited characteristics that genes were passed and sometimes mutated from one generation to the next\nWell we know life can be complicated so we should not be surprised that evolution is not just based on the tree of life and inherited genetics\nWe learned in the Nineteen seventies that there are creatures that are kind of in between single celled bacteria and multi cellular creatures like human a category of life called archaea that could hold the key to how life got started on her\nAnd out scientists discovered horizontal gene transfer which changes genomes by a sideways infection sometimes across species author David Quammen tells the story of this new understanding of evolution in his book the tangled tree a radical new history of life\nDavid joins us from Bozeman, Montana welcome to living on earth thank you Steve very good to be with you so what is the story that you set out to tell\nWell it's the story of the tree of life as the image of evolutionary history on earth\nWhich goes back to Darwin and the way that image that tree has been radically challenged and radically revised and the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing\nA kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have and those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought\nThe story that you set out to tell\nWell it's the story of the tree of life as the image of evolutionary history on earth\nWhich goes back to Darwin and the way that image that tree has been radically challenged and radically revised in the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing a kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have\nAnd those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought we knew about the history of life on earth\nTo summarize I think it's fair to say a big takeaway here is that what we think of as species what we think of as individuals and for that matter the whole tree of life where evolution show species neatly diverge increments origin well not exactly right why is that\nThat's putting it politely I said at the end of the book after having told these stories of these people in their discoveries that this whole\nRevolution has challenged three categorical ideas and that's the idea of species the idea of\nIndividual and the idea of the tree of life the idea of a species that it's a unitary thing it's a population of creatures that are similar to one another and they injure breed with one another and only with one another\nThe idea of an individual there is an individual named Rufus the brown dog there is an individual named Charles Robert Darwin there was an individual Steve Kerr would David Quammen\nAnd we are a unitary in discreet and thirdly the tree of life represents the history of life on earth that is a tree shaped history and it turns out that all three of those ideas this categorical Z are wrong in important\nWays you know it's tough for a moment yours is a story of people a scientist trying to understand life and how it has evolved pilot continues to evolve tell me about some of the characters in your story especially car was\nMm yes so I came across this fellow early on in my own discovery of this subject Karl Rove and microbiology at the University of Illinois who came out of nowhere and suddenly in November third Nineteen Seventy seven\nAppeared on the front page of the New York times above the fold picture of him and a story about his discovery of a third kingdom of life on earth the separate form of life and was unknown to exist before that\nBefore that we thought they were basically two kinds of life bacteria and everything else bacteria were simple cells everything else was composed of complex cells would sell nuclei animals plants fun guy humans\nAnd ... came along and said no wait a minute I've discovered a third form and that was the beginning of a sequence of discoveries that he essentially triggered that have led to this new understanding\nAnd by the way what was that he discovered what was between bacteria and multi cellular organism\nThere was a group of organisms now known as the archaea archaea as in archaeology suggesting old because it was thought that they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe\nThese were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes they're not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals to plant than they are to bacteria\nBut they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe these were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking at microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes they're not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals plants than they are to bacteria\nThey are radically distinct and so he announced in a scientific paper and the press announced in headlines that he had discovered a separate form of life a third major kingdom\nNow by the way about this kingdom the car was discovered these are pretty tough characters are aren't they they're they're they're in hot spots very extreme temperatures that sort of thing\nWell these creatures the archaea at first they seemed to live entirely in extreme environments as you said um hot springs in Yellowstone Park thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean highly acidic environment more and more as scientists discovered ways to sequence DNA just out of the wild\nThey have discovered these creatures live in a lot of different environments not all of which are extreme but one of the groups of extremity loving our kids\nLive near vents at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean almost ten thousand feet down between Norway and Iceland and those are ... are called low key archaea and it's now thought that they in fact\nAre the descendants of our original ancestors that we all complex creatures grew out of an ancestor that more closely resembled one of those one of these are key and living in a fence at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean\nThan having come from anywhere else but those are how to put it there are the descendants of our ultimate ancestors that we come from archaea and not from say the bacterial side of the tree of life\nThen raises the question maybe they came from someplace else because if they're really tough ... they might have survived interstellar space\nYou know that's why NASA funded car was his work\nHis original funder when he discovered the archaea one of his funders was the national aeronautics in space administration why because they thought that his work might shed light on the problem of XO biology\nThe possibility of the existence of life on other planets other star systems other places around the universe\nTell me a bit more about Carl was the man\nWas a biophysicist he was trained to\nAt Amherst and then at Yale in ... physics that was his PHD and then he went to work for the general electric labs in Schenectady New York they hired him as a research molecular biologist and he really had no idea what they wanted him to be doing he sat in a lab in Schenectady for a few years new to linger around\nAnd trying to make some important discoveries he was always interested in pure science in the deep questions what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then\nEventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professor that didn't spend much time with undergraduates he was a terrible lecture\nHe was reclusive you didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch\nWho could be wonderful to the students could be a sign generous mentor but couldn't\nInterested in pure science and the deep question what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then eventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professor that didn't spend much time with undergraduates he was a terrible lecture\nHe was reclusive you didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch\nWho could be wonderful to the students could be a sign generous mentor but could also be this total reclusive grump a complicated man with different sides to him which is\nPart of what attracted me to him as a character is a central character the book the other thing that attracted me it was and\nI quickly saw that he's probably the most important biologist of the twentieth century that nobody has ever heard of so\nOne could say that convergence is a major theme of your book and of course than the Darwinian tradition wear jeans past vertically from parents offspring we'd draw trees to represent this movements in the limbs on a tree only diverge from other branches\nBut David if the tree of life is not actually a tree how might we best described evolution based on what you've researched and written about here\nWell some people say we should think of a Web and not a tree of life because as you say convergence is very very important a network of life one fellow suggested the circle of life\nAnd yet the tree is still mostly right captured some big patterns but there are exceptions to those patterns the tree image was valuable to Darwin and the people who followed him because it represented the divergence that has occurred\nThrough the history of life one lineage diverging into two lineages one limb into two branches et cetera and species diverge him from one another all of this divergence that led to the diversity of life that we see on earth now\nBut it's not just a matter of divergence the discoveries that flowed from from what was his work and his methodology including things like the prevalence of a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways across boundaries\nThose represented convergence and so the real history of life is a history of lots and lots of divergence complicated by a lesser but very significant amount of convergence genes moving sideways", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "02"}
