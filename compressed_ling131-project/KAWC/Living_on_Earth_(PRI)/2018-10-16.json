slash cancer care\nIt living on Earth I'm Steve her with\nHurricane Michael quickly blew up into a devastating category for storm as it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico it's yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael was only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty fifty in Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial\nBut this new report finds that have to agree different poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author for high PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael go ahead to be here again\nBecause of the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nAre projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change produces far or with that's been said all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next vehicle special reports that I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report that just came out is on the question of\nWhat is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a group of society is not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report\nIn the end the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report that just came out is on the question of\nWhat is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach a net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report than frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nIs sort of like twelve years ago we don't do what we should do the world comes to an end that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end cause that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states but it will make life just miserable expensive\nAnd uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of lemonade warming to a degree and a half centigrade\nContrary to what most people think of the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological\nThe costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but the real obstacle is a social and political one\nHow do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do than as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nReducing end eventually eliminating our dependence on petroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get toward mid century\nIt seems we go in and need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nWe slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we're going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use so tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this\nParticular report so\nWhen the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing a research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nOff somewhere in the open plain beyond the trees now at last the lions begin a deep puffing cough\nRule rural or is\nIt is hard to figure out exactly where it's coming from and that's the point of it only the lions and the lion has says now\nAnd the hunted in their panic will

G.\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded assets as it applies\nTo climate change let me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves\nThen there was in the land or Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded asset all that value disappeared to what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think that all that fossil fuel in the ground which is on balance sheets and billions and billions and billions of dollars\nAnd it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly to what extent are we headed down a path I mean to solve the problem we had was slavery I mean there's the moral question there just like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war\nYeah idle at I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry are all diversifying\nA Shelby pay their all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market would go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and Bob there's going to be oil and gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee is not for to allow him\nWhy I'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the un and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough\nWe could reach what's called a tipping point\nWhere things begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying of dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable\nAnd if you get into that kind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the

are we going to have a president who is a desire of this science\nNinety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies all say this is happening happening now and it's caused by not exclusively but largely by human beings\nAnd we don't respond to this whoa whoa to us any of them were entering another set of
