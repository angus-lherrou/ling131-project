well you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nUs so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically is concerned between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up the fleas uses same energy they use to conclude that this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone\nIt's a new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of

suppliers and some component manufactured this is going to be a challenge there's no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral ... that from North America and our

this year that it wasn't even ready to have the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. jets inspector general findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da Jess secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the age as held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border\nUntil the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keys drugs within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nAge age asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da jets had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to

their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nThen what happened to those family\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\n... does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still hadn't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joe you're walking [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Tana has become a popular campaign stop for President Trump and vice president Pence so popular that each of them has been there twice in recent months that's because Republicans are trying to unseat to turn democratic Senator Jon tester\nDuring Pence's second visit there yesterday he fired up a rally talking about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports\nRunning in a state that President Trump won by more than twenty points catcher emphasizes that you can work with Trump he's run an ad listing Nineteen bills you supported that Trump is sign so when vice president Pence spoke in Bozeman yesterday he painted touched or as a reliable and reflexes member of the Democratic resistance\nEat all the latest allegations of fully\nSenator has already now voting no on your show off just like even though we're ...\nDidn't take a position on Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh citing first his record on privacy issues and support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge Kavanaugh I don't think he\nHas the merits nor the background to\nUh meet the needs of Supreme Court\nRepublican challenger Matt Rosendale says he'd be a more reliable ally for President Trump in sided the Supreme Court vote as an example\nMyself and a lot of the people are ... are very disturbed with the way this entire process was handled there is a man who has a commendable record and\nHe should be serving on the bench and\nDisturb with the way this entire process was handled there is a man who has a commendable record and\nHe used to be serving on the bench and absolutely I Would vote for him\nOn paper standing firmly with President Trump would appear to be a winning strategy in Montana the population here skews older and wider than the U.S in general Montana also has the second highest population of veterans per capita of any state guys like Jim hunting film [noise]\nTired after Twenty years in the navy ending felt now volunteers at the airport\nIn Missoula helping arriving tourists he voted for President Trump\nGonna mess around with this country we're going to do something as no crosses the line of red lie to\nWhile heading failed says he hell no didn't vote for President Obama like many Montana voters he isn't easy to pigeon hole he says he voted for tester before and for Democratic governors Steve bullock in twenty sixteen\nAnd he says a candidate support for the president or testers vote on Kavanaugh's nomination won't sway his choice\nNo because I don't use as a platform to make my this is\nStill plenty of voters do see their vote as a sign of support for president from Bozeman retirees Suzie Burton was at a senior community center yesterday near where vice president Pence was holding a campaign rally\nWell I think a pressing during marvelously actually\nHe keeps his promise [noise]\nAmount and many of them do\nWell President Trump is front and center in the Senate race here identity and\nLocal issues also matter for example tester has put Rosendale on the defensive about whether national forest in Montana could be privatized Rosendale initially opposed federal land ownership but says he now convinced that that's not what people want\nAnd test her leans hard on his image as a third generation farmer Rosendale moved to the state in two thousand two after a career as a Marilyn real estate developer\nVoters will be watching closely Saturday as the to debate one last time before early voting starts later this month for NPR News I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula, Montana [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n\nThe U.S sent a warship through water is claimed by China and\nThe Chinese ship steered right into its path they might well have collided playing see going version of chicken is not just the U.S game the u._k.\nAnd France Japan are all undertaking similar feeding the navigation operations in the south China Sea\nWhy we can expect more close encounters with China next time on the world\nThe world hears this evening at six o'clock right after all things considered ... eighty point nine FM ...

though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking\nWas that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that I've just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of the conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAt is causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how victims should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is\nWhy [noise] Monica ...

today in the journal science advances they say this gas giant appears to have a Neptune sized moon\nWe still ... that we think is the leading hypothesis\nThe researchers have requested more time on

told CNN about her first meeting with Donald Trump before he was president of\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors and he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this he just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him his father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back\nAnd ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge in a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or employed over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well we think that's not\nTrue um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nFor having me Ari in New York Times story you just heard it now says Trump's were able to get away with the tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators where either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do that\nAbout it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do that\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are in the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades as simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating at tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions on law and the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan ... says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe as as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all
