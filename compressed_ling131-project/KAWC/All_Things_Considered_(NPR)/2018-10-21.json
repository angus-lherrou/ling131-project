mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him and unnamed people inside the consulate NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement into ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nThey know that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show gee arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body\nPresident Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order for this is equipment and various things

during police encounters\nAnd a few minutes we're going to hear from a Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she NATO uh Kobe was observe walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this er Kobe later died at a hospital and it might have ended there was out much public attention\nSalted the deputy and then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital\nAnd it might have ended there without much public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Coby it's Facebook public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds um if it's the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrests for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described it six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you describe those things you\nMight not sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in that says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersect the nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man and the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected to issues of race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who shouted by the rooftop this story that needed to be told\nThat's about ... uh Kobe's shoots the sister of genetic do uh Kobe who died earlier this month after being paid by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook\nWho died earlier this month after being paid by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with and I sympathize with your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course apple is ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man with black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know my family\nWhy are you [noise]\nKnow Rene\n... state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement during traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up kind of steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nJust and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find a\nOr expectations of citizens and police officers at what's lost here is that people taking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't\nIt doesn't just focus on the video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen\nAnd also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done has defied the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is\nA minimum of two hours\nThe video was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw that at least the video aimed at the students to fix to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in your your fried I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that you sent spark your concern here is an African American man and not get an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you were\nLiving as this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior content\nBut the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this rates ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with assume it or they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve in something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose country to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the\nAnd I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts to kind of indoctrination\nA law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges and not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create\nPipelines fraternities sorority and say all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy lawn schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say not fine\nAnd what his heritage say about that I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending that's program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouth about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating ...\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible here that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be here\nToday we're going to head into the barbershop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their mind today we want to talk about how Hollywood it's putting the opioid crisis front and center in London or love your show\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with it every day I cannot stop thinking about it but for others the issue was brought forth\nSo let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with it every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC
