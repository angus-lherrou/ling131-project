McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a

about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an

something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions\nNot her occasional statements don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress as the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi\nThat's despite the fact McAdams said he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he'd keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back passes because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing district the party is trying to flip this year

Kathryn ... on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\nGuy\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who had to give the Republican some hope\nSo we we handle our homes especially of Hispanic community is away Trump wants to run\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nFor security order you know you need certain order in in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall and I think it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door and makes me feel safer [noise]\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal barricades\nBut still side and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently just agree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a status you seem to have been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you asked me\n... all that you know Trump and it's a gender\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eighth team could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans\nCould be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote so the question\nFor Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time what what did they say they'll say um how could you be a Republican when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics it all support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise] I'm\nOnly going to take some of the time I was telling me a river on the Republican running for real and I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne like no I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised a tour immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country another today but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump administration's pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position and that physician is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm Out here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI have to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug do you see on the ballot and its Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's the former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt was the as you approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall\nHe is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for Doug juice\nThat under that logic Republicans want to appeal hearty why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party and the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him a truck driver who says immigration the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to see the same way he got\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nI feel my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got to vote and they said that we were ready to go we're there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party governor do you see that will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew as Saudi ties we take a closer look because the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of your mouth controlled ... Buss credited Trump pitch the campaign trail and us merchant narration\nAnd we'll just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but at any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis which was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet some eyebrows had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in their research but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised to the Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David Cay he is the United nations special repertory on freedom of opinion an expression which means he's tasked with protecting though it's very rights around the world\nK. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what ... what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fist fight to Adam seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this maybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve analyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two\nOr it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks while once it's\n[noise] um\nSpecials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide uh they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council to do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject\nTo ah to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if they decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and said why not\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies\nIt would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about you know but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you for the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used wood from his old garage door to build the first

book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little tasked by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Rock and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that say\nMet more people that have happened Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to Todd really looked at reading\nThink it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he writes about projects especially those that had to do with youth or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition with the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up that sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them in prison in Wisconsin and other states and they came while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan\nThese little free libraries have\nUp and ... communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave that might have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and that all that when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel that's a little sense of pleasure that somebody else who's going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing thing being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of his idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little libraries big heroes and we were talking about little

this bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for the care of and\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be your desk or that they were using it in for migrants and then the gate shut again [noise]\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nIs I don't see them up for what it'll ... were women [noise]\nWhat he said was that she went to the

in the classroom\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move into are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them and\nAs asylum seekers and so they many of them say we are not going to leave it spreads we're going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone\nUh so it it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around and we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and man getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into their country for what they say over and over again as we know that
