World Series to talk about this historic match up we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza\nHe felt that that I [laughter]\nOkay so like just lay off the stage where this battle the humans both teams have these huge history to the biggest fan bases\nHow ethic is is based off\nWhat's crazy also these teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game show about game for the Boston Red Sox who they even ... even without favor you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that are back\n... this go okay with it\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's a historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they miss each other when they've all been in the world series was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back and sparkly but also it brings them she two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broke in this case the Dodgers got it torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that one seven games that went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the team is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this could have been there all kinds of or eat or he's at shortstop they lock or a secret during the season now they have a child and then really is there a case I Know it's not Clinton ...\nIts Walker Mueller so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest they one of the best picture that we've seen in the ...\nYeah it's not Clinton crushed shock it's Walker Mueller so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the fact that you're that we've seen in the national lean they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nA really positive that a lot of reason to celebrate but I mean the patriots and the red\nSox but this gene is argument one of the best regular season we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best thing the baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to hide your mate game yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get if you want a hundred and ... yeah they were ... they are so good out of it as we know and the policy then the vaccines and only when you got to go out and play [noise] All right\nI Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nGutters and that's kind of shocked a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there's nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that\nTalent pitching hitting I don't care drug a number out yeah is redemption it's and it's it's fire the Dodgers have because they live in in heaven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nRight that was ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series

care of and keep studying Justin safe gives them a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way\nShe could imagine making it to the U.S for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now in an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border two hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first day that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification Z\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't vote the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if uh\nHave criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy

the big industry is agriculture and where you know the seasons wrapping up in terms of workers and and farms we know what's your message to to farmers to farm workers you know to the agriculture community here in this area\nMessages here in Yuma people understand the importance of a functional immigration system where we are and we rely very heavily on labor and I think there are ways to do this that can be productive but if not going to happen unless we stop using unless immigration is is no longer use as a political issue\nWhat people hear about on the radio and on television often is more about fear it's more about division and not about productive solutions and I look forward to winning and beginning a conversation about those productive solutions because a labor arrangement our commuter relationship with Mexico it's extremely important narrow don't ever got to keep the maintain that relationship\nAnything else you want to saying closing about you know as we get ready for

a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations close polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat

administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the

than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the
