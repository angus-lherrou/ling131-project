all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities and made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThat has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics sketchy other tense at this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago\nWhen I spoke with pizza banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories that sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a as unleash something that is going to move the country in a better direction\nAnd women across the country across the world for that matter\nA have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now or at least it makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision can make an informed decision with all the

shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision\nWith all the facts that have happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford\nButtons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going\nTo be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will\nBecause it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond

McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's a sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who said that really that's where the problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing actively if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\n[noise] what would you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing the shots and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in fact the pockets of report it on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about police\nShe's with Van Dyke or the officers said that\nDriving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in fact the pockets of report it on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive policing practice says that after the video was released to the shooting the department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen\nThere is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case\nThat we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promising the path that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so\nWhat's gonna happen from here\n... she's the host of sixteen shots at a pod cast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke and the shooting death of a crime McDonald she was kind of to join us from WBEZ each in white thank you so much for talking\nWith human show\nNow we want to head into the barber shop to put a bow and it's incredibly divisive an emotional week in Washington D.
