President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop critics\nBert tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop\nCritics of the president say his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I used to Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House and of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did would blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a standard is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he said something directly after the the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nThe job [noise] I guess she doesn't have any and this was more than she does and I have no\n... and since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a beef without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that well\nYou mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the metro what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown the president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nIn an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states it\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying well Republican\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on

be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five

this is all\nThings considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decide to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country and how do you go around with the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThink that the ... by the women's march I have that show that is [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... you have to turn away from family we show what is\nWendell [noise]\nIt's hard labor family we show when it is\nWhere the\nWife of why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that ... we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it actually missing urgency there's nothing else\nAyesha Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nGet a relationship in the middle of it because I was in the leaves all the others leave on the safe on\nIn life will he fits the profile\nMy dad used to my brother's history there are all star\nGame we use slim bills\nEvery man in the polls\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a Berkes resented the implication that at the zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nBlack women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drug it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party\nThese pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a ... in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire while they're at several organizations that are not a CBC a directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new

over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in

was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning magna coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour bus again went on a media spree asking for

all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I know that Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped about I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual alleged that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller so allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny she said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers huff and perhaps most importantly\nThe scrutiny she said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers huff and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working I\nSee okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections and what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yes ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six I mean a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims it's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than thirty per week\nNPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nLast month the usual ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young rocks somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this day the team had come to pick up the body of a child on the phone decided on a boy at seven I guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... alone fought the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn current on to some Vermont to be your monitor be man you just hear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke rarely ... you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first ... because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea any team did manage to drive off in time but the tears these government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly because many people into communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people in scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group local population very distrustful of the government even to this part of the ... the have a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor and he believes the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth\nDistrustful of the government even to this part of the DNC had a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor a United Nations peacekeeping force that is how strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so that's put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shoot up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even you know whether they're true motives the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city has been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing
