in and also the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that with quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very tail shaken damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines\nFairs the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nFigure saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some talk of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nDon't you just used for the checks the place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the poor so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best than people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type on the board is not without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would it be in the case which is a pretty big\nHits and spit out into sort of an aircraft crunchy losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person have clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exports so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they will they will be effective because UK off to practice it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is an asymmetric shock well it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest loses will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all quiet at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does the deal and Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think that she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times\nDespite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the

plan on living out in real life\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when a president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is a deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and one is good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county officials and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice

repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam said he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they aren't calling for single payer health care or impeachment\nSo if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate shifts party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got

according to the international council of shopping centers over the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark comment as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all the Sears stores shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they refer to\nWho are booming who are\nReceiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee\nBecause if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tentative and they're only limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do with the space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their spiritual opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost the Sears\nAnd the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... cat they re imagined the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk

declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over
