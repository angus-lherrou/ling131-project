the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate\nAnd Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering uses to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nA steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram poets that that really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMidterms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that their them disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit and the way that\nBecause you still have this country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always had inside her mind immediately that Taylor Swift always seem to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything\nKind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it I think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when it comes to me as a DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line and she counters sued him for a salt and\nThey do to her after
