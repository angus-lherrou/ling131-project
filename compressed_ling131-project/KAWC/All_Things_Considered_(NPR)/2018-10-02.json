providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet provider should have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulation like\nNo blocking of whatever let's say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an apt to your visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which

a deal wherever I might give you dreaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now but California has gone through what has the reaction\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive\nLiberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nA the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming company video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your ... your Comcast\nThat have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place\nAnd are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California\nIs an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states um it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies um including immigration emission standards and often when\nCalifornia sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how good California's Oakland threats within each\nOther all the taxes play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office\nAnd the department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect until January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr the tech companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorneys general including California

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Jason Kander a Missouri politician seen as a rising star in the Democratic party and the favorite in the Kansas City mayors race is dropping out\nCandor is a veteran who served in Afghanistan and today he said he's falling out of the race in order to seek treatment for his P. T. S. D. and depression NPR's Quil Lawrence covers veterans and the VA and he joins us now like Well hi or tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a form of Missouri's secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad hundreds in Kansas\nSenate or blind and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he support gun supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says he's I'd like to see some of the barn do this\nAnd the ad got in national attention or he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician the Democratic\nParty and his decision today to pull out of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message a tell us about it\nIt was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nOr that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and he'd been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating

posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and he'd been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment\nAnd that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example long what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing except usually on the you know\nOn the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior but uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistic saying that suicide has increased especially among the ... generation of veterans and candor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nThat some parents Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you Ari now we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is worth almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this here that the median salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before more than seven hundred workers in California warehouse and told them they are getting around\nBe Dave Clark he told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years it's been an Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR's sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nLower announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum may\nBefore any other uh\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temp and seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility or was under eleven dollars and it ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon stay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest man in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of the speech in Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well\nAnd twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of be the speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between bases his wealth and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside they spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful Caesars said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinize inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's going a little bit I derive\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporation whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm a college professors and producer will cause other companies like Wal Mart a fair for them to start reading the world for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars the summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news is the\nAuthor is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made weights today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for relieving for Congress\nBut senator standard says he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is writing Alina Selyukh NPR News\nWork here and whether or not and I think an awful loaded is another question altogether seats are more you can stream Lee slowly

sheets traveling in Indonesia central ... province thank you very much Julie thank you\nKnow to the Supreme Court where today the justice has grappled with a difficult death penalty question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia but he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVern in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffered from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urine eights on himself and asks the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail\nNo Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his huge but he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asks\nThe guards to take him to the toilet [noise] the problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders them so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who gets a frantic are delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to three researchers including Donna Strickland Strickland is the first woman to share the physics prize in fifty five years NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports on what took so long\nEven Donna Strickland herself seems surprised at how few women have won the Nobel in physics she was asked about it at a press conference earlier today\nYou are the second woman ever getting that Nobel Prize in physics\nAll let's comments on that okay I think\nIt's true there was Marie Curie in Nineteen oh three a nuclear physicist named Maria ... mayor in Nineteen sixty three and now Strickland a researcher at the University of Waterloo in Canada who won for her work on ultra fast alter bright laser pulses\nJoe coal a particle physicist at Bruno university London in the u._k.

claiming that men were better than women do physics he was suspended\nOther researchers in recent years have lost their jobs over sexual harassment that's progress as Jane Lou an astronomer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory\nI think at the right direction but it's different from being respected for a one expertise\nLew says she's experienced all kinds of sexism for example whenever she went to visit the telescope\nI wouldn't have a grad student and it will mail because I didn't have any female student and I was always a student can beat the student and I got my student was always assumed to be the person in charge me\nLose says she thinks that kinda biased contributes to why they're so few Nobel Prize is awarded to women and physics to get the prize you have to be nominated by another physicist or astronomer most of whom are men\nI don't know what action will be thousands of nominations for men and maybe you know like five nomination for women I don't know something like that\nIt's a small percentage that's for sure that's ... and the secretary general of the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences during today's press conference he says the academy which runs the Nobel is trying to fix the problem\nWhere are you taking measures to encourage more no nation because we don't want to miss anyone\nLew says the Nobel need to catch up with the times Silicon Valley billionaires have begun financing a bunch of new prices for physicists to wind blew herself or I'm One of the prices the Catholic prize in twenty twelve and she was in good company\nThat yeah I Won they will for
