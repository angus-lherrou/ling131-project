Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona\nPresident Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latino is will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called ... it's about eighty percent Latino [laughter]\n\nTown just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\nGuy\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could give the Republican somehow\nSome way we handle our homes especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floor it's he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stand\nFor security order you know you need certain order in in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall doesn't get any of it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nSit outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently just agree with parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the names are coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a\n... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me\nI mean who's solving all that you know Trump in its agenda\nThere is a reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right\nNow Republicans are banking on two things\nJews have Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to do when the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nI'm at a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district to state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship but it's not easy to get away\nFrom the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as the knock on doors [noise] I'm\nOnly going to take some of the time I was told me a river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have a mix including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne like you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents were from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go outside with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is\nTo where I go outside with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think this is a country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her Vero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nIt sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm Out here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... election a stubborn you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who the former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party and the Trump administration's rhetoric\nAnd there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah Stacey\nWhat's going on they see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you gotta you gotta ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMore than a week after one of the most destructive hurricane ever recorded hit the Florida Panhandle survivors are still looking for missing relatives\nBut all the indications from the administration or that they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin ... uh because they seem to see him as an ally and Trump has suggested that he is a personal ow\nSo it is not known only to the president Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham\nHas weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he's very skeptical of the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line are you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honestly remains to be seen\nSanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line are you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honestly remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood this is an individual you know we we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing when he was over eating as\nA journalist for the Washington Post and who was a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered the consulate\nI of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that\nWe're interested in doing um when you are talking about the middle east we're talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which scale the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over that\nI find it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close the borders sense of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tore him as\nA young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is\nThis is a former propaganda that can be is being used to kind of justify us off the line here\nPeople should read his final piece for the Washington Post which was really a powerful call for freedom in the Arab world that was really overweight and white and blue short of column and that's what he has been in that is the man who was\nKilled let me ask you both to set aside for a moment questions about the weather has passed is relevant has passed before he became a journalist who came to the U.S and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis\nFor the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations Bruce\nI think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really messed up here um you know they've\nArrested I think if it's Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested doesn't dismiss five others so I have to stay at a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously\nUm I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or suggests that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on M. B. S. as he is known the crown\nPrince\nIs in an hour or ... or former ah I think this has really brought home the sides of his regime or that or we're pressure of his image will never be the same as it was a when he started out and was getting a lot of remarkably good impression that this is a big problem for him going forward\n[noise] lots of outstanding questions lots more to discuss when we

much for having me\nSame time same place is reviewing the Washington Post and the Brookings Institution thanks to you too great to be with you and repeating of the federal is thanks for coming in

little library died yesterday Todd bowl which sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine ... years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin\nNow there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very touched by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Rock and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me is the only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people are having Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch read a book and watch people in the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up that sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in ... in Wisconsin and other states and they came along refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard in South Sudan\nThese little free libraries have\nUp and brought in communities together\nPeople of course take books from libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I felt a little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he ...\nThere you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bull when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more can what he's doing thinking a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects springing life as a result of an idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us thank you
