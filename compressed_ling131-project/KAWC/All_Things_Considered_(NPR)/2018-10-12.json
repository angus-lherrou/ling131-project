Trump\nThey've been exchanging complements for a while it it really picked up after ... war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and went to had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat are they Saturday Night live to prove auto it on the liberals improve on it if you don't love\nWe don't look good this is\nWest was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis\nOr because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump's claims that west coming out in support of him has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says and what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye\nWest or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote get it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban

argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into

spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from ...\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and send us a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see a some Turkish executives who'd been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nThe evangelical Christians in the

Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices care is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine\nMight suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma B. M. O. capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists if you think\nTransportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies a low minimum um because the parent has gone up as well so because it\nLike the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminium suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf our company Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now still so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking going category alive many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacy Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie task the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nPlanet Money comes from for why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nBut what does the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions by we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nNPR's Greg Myre thank you thank you turned out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nOr promises that there is no to the conclusion other than the Russians faith was ... for the attempted murder\nIn September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to ...\nRussian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it okay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nOr promises that there is no tentative conclusion other than the Russians faith was ... for the of some ...\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would ... says I'm visa ... to\nA guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through in kind of fight saying at the military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up let a photo shows are boy ...

News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player at ... that's right the athletic ran who may is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of it Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat with the shooter made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good\nSo why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been quarter and yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so I've come with a big part of the appeal but tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research lost your life you had about ... percent of the week wearing their shoes was oh okay I'll step in and combat that is pretty common bond okay [laughter] you do have they\nDo have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed six of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't ... cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIncredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have it's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were dropped by that you know we're bus didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are\nFor a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were dropped high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out hula hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's meta kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of ... through our game\nAnd they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights audience ... things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun they have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's wow this huge space as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want shoes that looked like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes in my neck [noise] ...

station it's\nAll things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the\nPope I think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat whether it's completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take\nThat much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of

impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigates the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws ... exceeded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its word ... haven't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWay called the road map in our office because last just up\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under ... by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the Watergate special that was very interesting I when I asked you to load that was added up to the house I lay on or if they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry Schwartz stole\nIt relevant to historians is relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nTwenty first century variation of the Silk Road map something with lower team likely considered\nSales spot on the Watergate team was James corals to now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document\nMeanwhile the battle over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end\nThis week judge barrel how ordered the national archives to review it

Americans many jobs for Americans he\nAnnounced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve\nThis week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control\nI think what they're doing is wrong alright for some perspective on that we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it about since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nThink it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing do you think then at the\nPresident's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and held sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nNo I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the institutions well insulated from the political when the president the tax could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do\nAny risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and helps sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes [noise]\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up to his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime\nGerman power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve\nFrom political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome thank you for having me on [noise]\nListening
