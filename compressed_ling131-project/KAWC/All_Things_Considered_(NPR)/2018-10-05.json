called the opportunity atlas it is a map it's a map that uses tax and US Census data to attract people's income from one generation to the next and it reveals some uncomfortable truths\nIt turns out even what block you were born on can make a big difference NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports that in one New York city neighborhood the divide is especially stark when\nPeople find out where ... was from they often react in disbelief how how did you come home and you live there and it's like almost as if it's like I Can't believe you made it out plus he was born into Lyndon houses a brick complex public housing to several thousand families\nRight next to Brownsville in Brooklyn nearly forty percent of Brownsville lives in poverty\nAnd if you look at the opportunity out less and zoom into Brownsville a lot of it is exactly what you'd expect black kids raised in the area thirty some years ago now make about Seventeen thousand dollars a year same as their parents\nBut once you head across Dumont avenue everything changes\nBlack kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents making around twenty six thousand dollars a year\nTo find out what happened on the other side of Dumont avenue people told me to go to church [laughter]\nDavid Cay Brawley is one of the leaders in east Brooklyn congregations in his office he tells me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning of ... in the civilization burned out homes empty lot people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had

dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the men in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was growing and we needed something that was much better for the children\nWhose philosophy is Audra mom she and her husband came to New York from Honduras and beliefs fleeing poverty they identify as both black and Hispanic they say they're grateful that public housing with available when they needed it but jumped on the chance to move on when the children were born\nI didn't like elevators up and down the elevators for my children because it was a lot of people living in the housing projects\nFor a lot of people in Brownsville him surrounding areas coming up with thirty thousand dollars for a house was impossible for the Blasio family it took generations worth of savings\nMy mother build her first ... that eventual loser was hard work and she used the trade to build a house out of timber eventually to build a house out of concrete cement block just like the story of the three little thing\n...

colleagues at Harvard found that\nThe sooner kids move out of an area with such limited opportunity the better they will fare\nWhen the ... family moved they didn't just got back yard they shifted their future like a shift change in course here's Reverend Raleigh\nI'm not surprised when I look at this map and see the see that as planted there has been a harvest\nThere are a lot of factors that determine a child success having a mom like Ruth ... tough but loving is definitely one of them but it turns out geography also matters a lot of kids who moved here from public housing did a lot better than those they left behind\nReverend Raleigh beams when I tell him to have to pull off your children are working on their masters and PHD he says to me and my house is in Brooklyn gave children space to do homework a good night's sleep\nWhen people have ownership of their property ownership of the community you have a better chance of redress or core issues such as education and quality of life\nA neighborhood that can focus on more than just surviving the day to day Brawley points out that those quaint thirty thousand dollar near my house is built on land once sold for a

jarring but in person it's completely an spectacular people bustle on their way to work cars zoom by just another New York city street\nAnd you know it's it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their minds after procedurals out like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person instill approved Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final they'll comes about thirty hours later I mean sometimes maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and they are eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd today Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that the Republican enthusiasm may said if a cab and I'll get confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much ink you well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges pass to have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I uh eventually did reach them by from the did than told me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run was had been pre filled by the prison we've used when I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the free thousand the characters but he says the bill out\nSo you filled out the form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called buck a way to buy my food on the computer a hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI\nCharacter spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it allows\nI did not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you that it's a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nWhen you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there actually a lot more uh\nTheir place of work a and looking for something else so you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically I mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional and business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that\nActually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nA it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nAs Cardiff

Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the Koran McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what does the reaction\nWell because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described ... chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes is blank um he said that the\nThat that was ... raised in life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this and said that show the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that\nThe tension here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there than another trial related to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a present that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community field but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that would require a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago

for the big announcement was John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees Joe Malcolm joins me now welcome\nIt's pleasure being with you and my thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up yes I'll be\nMore pleased after it's done tomorrow now creating the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I\nLet you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and ugly questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nThe thing to the rule judge and they should have been in a from a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearing\nMore than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum

the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing to the road and they should have been in a from a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar\nWho know him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what comment on I\nHad by the way he acted like in a ...\nI think that response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was face so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clinton that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law\nAnd not based release based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about the sacrifice that wealth is er reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat he found the tactic somewhat the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because he's not the Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the call it but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's dreams and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously indignant that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics today is it\nNation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually going to hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question

will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics city is it that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political edge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you [noise] it's good to be with you at the heritage foundation's John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate is huge and how says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from employers if they can't find more earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... get implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year\nBut lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that have historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero bacon says remember\nTo keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting president trumps policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate buy more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist ... the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have case but\nThis is really a hero\nBacon says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policy makers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chairman Janet yell and said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally began raising rates gradually and has continued that pays under the feds current leader Jerome pile\nIf you followed the view many people on the fed and many other economists they would have started to slam on the breaks the unemployment got around five percent and they never would've allowed to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm ... woman you know the women

moment we're living through you'd be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and move to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October ... twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit soon on the Weinstein story on your right none of us knew what was going to happen when they said that out into the world we\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigation of sexual harassment me knew that this a part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editor it's I'm Matt\nParty like to say as we are right hand and he said Harvey Weinstein is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which one hundred years ago by trying to park\nAbout Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly we were reporting on Fort

to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that\nEspecially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also saw moments like

ago today ... thank you\nI I don't know that I can say what that means other than we're going to have their debate I think in this country about what it means when women come forward a and how our
