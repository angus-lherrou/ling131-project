all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to

John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing it's safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch\nStatistically you know you see when when you say ... percent it's significant that ... percent but then when you look at all none of us we talking about four to think of who says votes said this is something of says so from my perspective it's really what\nDrives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty you know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turn that we are saying that is danger than disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent yes we're looking more them well she is a police officer and meditation and we can get an investigative activity um Wednesday handling and they'll persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it if it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm On the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate thing the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years because of that on type policing United States so when when you put the two together the propensity to us violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event\nThen you have the the cut us off the outcome so somebody's looking at let's take

conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with the\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um death and the ones that are part of the ambush on top meant that activity is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given that particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their life and then some this technical issues how you approach and the ... and how you go to the house ah well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous\nTo me that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have Eighteen thousand police agents that few cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would help us make gay the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome of premeditated tucked evicted that was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one

considered\n\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology that's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would you really quite well with well controlled facial images that when the elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images and the when the elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at\nThe task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right\nSo how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple\nIf you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nFor for all tech considered comes from the ...

the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals they're cooked by a professional chef all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in the experiment are going to be adding capsules that content suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers\nWas that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead and food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and as he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were from page ... there were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them everyone is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there was this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressman or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association\nAnd and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yeah it's once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out salad so look outside went out bar acts went out we arsenic without dry you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out selling so look outside went out bore acts went out we or cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these out ... extremely dangerous compound\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation [noise] in\nPart because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused than even obsessive and and who you stand up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a
