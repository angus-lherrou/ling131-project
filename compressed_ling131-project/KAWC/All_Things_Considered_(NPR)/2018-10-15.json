program in Florida where relief efforts are underway in areas hit by hurricane Michael access to food water and other supplies is still a challenge NPR's Joel Rose has been there reporting for the last couple of days Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are trying to come back into their homes and and clean up after the storm\nBut you know it long lines as an improvement because earlier in the week you couldn't find any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs um so you know we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up\nAnd get these things out to people but it's you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the harder hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east of Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm um that are a little more difficult to reach so you know the emergency response is getting underway but I'm sure it's going to be awhile before it reaches everybody who is affected\nAnd communication is still really tough in places where phone services down the Internet's down how has that affected rescue effort\nI think it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service as non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City and the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to you know tell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here\nYou know I Need this or that kind of supply or even just I'm Alive you know I mean emergency crews are going door to door to try to you know figure out who survive the storm and who didn't and and I have to think it would be a lot\nIt it must be slowing this effort down for them not to be able to communicate with people by cell phone or anywhere almost anywhere in Bay county so it's um [noise] I think it's been a real hindrance to the relief effort\nPeople by cell phone or

protesting today [noise]\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Harvard University discriminates against Asian an Asian American applicants and here to tell us more is carry young she's a reporter with member station WBUR you are in Boston hey Carey high at first what are the arguments being made in the case\nStudents for fair admissions that group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing in admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic river or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering rates too much or that it's a deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allowed\nThe group also thinks that Harvard hasn't adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here it's at Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where they'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic wise\nActually allowed the group also thinks that Harvard has an adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here it's at Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or\nGPA standardized test scores things like that that they consistently or in lower personal scores from the admissions department and a a personal score is a number of the Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal ... letters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone faced\nBut the person behind this lawsuit is an Asian American right his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is true yes Edward Blum is the president of students for fair admissions and that is the group but technically brought this lawsuit\nUm and this isn't Edward blooms first court case attacking affirmative action policies in higher education he's also spearheaded the lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of Texas which he ultimately lost as you remember in the Supreme Court in twenty sixteen\nNow we did reach out to bloom for an interview up before trial but he declined we did speak with someone who is close to him Ilya Shapiro who's a he's a constitutional fellow at the Kato Institute\nHe explained blooms perspective to me this way\nAs a society we're already doesn't matter where government treats us all the same regardless so skeptical archer Asian American applicants and students are for her because of a stir illustrates the problem is\nWhat is Harvard have to say\nWell Harvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't have a quota pointing to the fact that in the last five years they have admitted about twenty nine percent more Asian applicants\nHarvard's legal team will also be presenting data that refused the plaintiffs analysis over those lower personal scores and W. B. U. R. spoke with Harvard's new president Larry back out over the summer a belt this lawsuit\nAnd well he couldn't comment on us specifics he did say that diversity is important to the school and that a lot of factors are considered in the submissions process\nThings Carrie thank you carry young as the senior education reporter for member station WBFO you are in Boston\nThe twenty Eighteen McArthur genius grants were awarded last week and we've been spending some time on the program with a few of the recipients today we'll hear from poet Natalie B.
