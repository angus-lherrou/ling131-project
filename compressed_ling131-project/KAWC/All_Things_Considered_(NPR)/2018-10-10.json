vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes then if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nRegular started jama in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exit on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friend died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill cruising find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified and the bad the action and be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is sometimes I'm the value of some of those limousine\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be a nationwide term jumper regulations that have made sure that these vehicles are\nA certain point\nSome stretch limos are safer than others he says companies can do a whole test where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before she the impact in the seat or is it not properly installed with certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior of the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safer limit when scientists as\nSome of the public not care about ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says\nThey seem to care about the price\nRose Mary Shay hand as the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if it's safe\nI think it's it's really quite the unfair people are always care about safety I think most people assume that if they're in the business that their minimum requirements that they have to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limit safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there with a deadly Leno crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLiving at the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of of moving out of DC uh having states lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are

six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about the exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressure so you're saying the economy remains strong to shouldn't that be good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool Tibet as have emerging\nSell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy remains strong Europe has cooled a bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nOf course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S in China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the\nSalah virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that some ... five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued\nHigh levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens let's say That's NPR's John Ydstie

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into extent all last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and by\nAnd it says according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people it's a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nIs is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or\nThere there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did these intercepts I he did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up\nTo back off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people and the White House and the current leadership and Saudi Arabia\n[noise] when you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there was a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal cooking chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v weight at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThat Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many

seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back schools the sheltered people

caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during a hurricane we actually opened back up\nTo date for the public after the hurricane um

don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get them
