CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community cells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been eating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nWe occasionally you see hope that we are an important part of your life

Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a vote or meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidate\nAnd more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country how the around the women around the circle here in Washington DC including school teacher\nAre happening that night across the country how do we do this to go around in the ocean I mean the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nThink that's the trust was by the women's march I had this call [laughter]\nThis is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump so\nWhite women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believe that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was with black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWhat is the\nWife of why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice\nThere's would actually be an urgent issue and\nThat's what it is actually missing is urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I broke it up relationships in the middle of it because I didn't leave all the others leave office has said something\nLive all he did a profile ...\nMy dad is six to my brother's history there are all starts with fears slim ...\nEvery day in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Robie a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like it all your resources and all the euro dollar are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nIs all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara laid right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus and\nPolitics so I reached out to California congresswoman ... right now she's making her own day to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and some black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we've seen brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and uh that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example that cycle with ion apparently in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley

range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero and one of the debate that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do\nActs in public as a way to get media attention can you describe\nHow gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning magna coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content with going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again went on a media spree asking\nFor users and explicitly tie this then to the white supremacists organizing and the new platform of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and and each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that per sits on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements I Want to\nPlay a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours posts when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect to do it like that you want us to just or anybody that phrase armed going in that what you're proposing here and here's the thing he answers it bad or each or we want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that she would hope would be president on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store is they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that\nWell I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as supporters of gap\nJoan Donovan is with data and society a research Institute in New York City thanks very much thank you [noise]\nI've got ... ... ... every ... in New York ... thanks very much thank you\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe outbreaks sickened more than two hundred people in caused the deaths of five other investigators from the food and Drug Administration traced about a quarter of the illnesses TMI area fields and later to a cattle feed lot near a local can out\nTo find out how last spring ... outbreak continues jam packed local growers I spoke with Paul brierley executive director of the University of Arizona humans Centre of excellence for desert agriculture\nWhat happened last spring was heartbreaking not just for those families that were affected the for the farmers who take a lot of pride in what they do so heading into this season certainly there's worry about what could happen but more than that I've seen a lot of optimism excitement that a new season is here and they have an opportunity to to showcase what they do\nEverybody who lives here this time of year sees the fields but you might not have knowledge of what's taking place food safety is not something that's just sprung up\nTwelve years ago and in two thousand six there was a similar outbreak from spinach and California food safety always has been important but after that is just incredible was put into place both voluntarily by the industry and also by government regulation and so there's all sorts of procedures in place to train workers to do testing of water and product\nAnd audits to make sure that they are in compliance\nThe CDC's never did come up with this is definitely the clause didn't they say ... canal water in the vicinity of the feedlot was a viable reason for this happening\nIt's true that doesn't mean that a lot hasn't happened in the law hasn't been learned we've had government people we've had university researchers and\nTask force us to come up with all the hypotheses of how this could have happened they've increased the buffer around feed lots they have new procedures about sanitizing equipment there's new procedures for requiring a environmental assessment after extreme weather events\nHas there been any indication that any of the markets might be a little leery about Yuma area growing produce\nWell that's always a concern I think they've largely gained back that trust through the time that's evolved since the outbreak everybody just needs to be on top of their game to avoid anything happening like that in the future\nOne thing recently is something called block chain coming from Walmart what does that mean\nBlock chain is something that was developed as part of bitcoin a virtual currency you don't have anything tangible so you have to have some kind of system with legitimate what's not so blocked in was developed for that and it's a highly secure ledger if every activity that happens to something so Wal Mart has been testing so produce can be tracked from the field through growing\nThrough harvests Jews cooling through the shipping through retail thought stored in one electronic ledger that couldn't be theoretically modified one used for that would be to instantly be able to track a box of produce you could push a button and\nHave the whole chain of events that happened to that box to produce or the girl was behind it\nThey're definitely behind improved traced back it not only is good for the consumer and those affected by a problem it's also good for the producer because then you're not going to be unfairly caught up in a net of saying void that product\nOne more question on the topic it seems over the years of living here now is people who grow things don't like it when it rains [laughter] so as our one time hurricane that it made it here had any impact on how the agricultural season has gotten off\nA huge impact we drive by and look at the fields and then they looked beautiful but every day is planned out for what to plant what to harvest again this is a fresh product it doesn't have a long shelf life\nDrive by and look at the fields and then they look beautiful and every day is planned out for what to plant what to harvest again this is a fresh product ... doesn't have a long shelf life and when it rains in your delayed by a week it's a huge problem where there was a

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports\nOne problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means that the United states\nWe are the economic and the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president's so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right\nAnd so the question is why they're selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about\nSees especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly the sheer trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy puts a stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't pay well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on male I have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like when you buy and how you
