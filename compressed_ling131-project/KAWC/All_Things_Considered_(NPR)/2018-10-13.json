Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey at court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House is likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nI'm Mary Louise so we're my me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he'd been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mayor and western turkey for years and years ah but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you adjust to fight against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron watched\nHe's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he would simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia ... taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from assemble it can\nTake the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast\nThe indicator from Planet Money and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why she it's getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi ... which makes free does in fact a vending machine Scott you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I now I'm a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the ...\nSo this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you does in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a new lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we've received in product costs for manufacturers so there's always a wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of freedom is Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices kill a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this off and companies are known them um because of the parents have gone up as well because it\nLike the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies ... looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum parents see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now still so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking him going category alive many of the other hand categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power or\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally\n[noise]\n\nAnd that was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nBut for Planet Money comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming in providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nNPR's Greg Myre thank you thank you turned out that the cube Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no to the conclusion of the the Russians face was ... for the of some ...\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would suddenly underwriters as ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when\nYou look at these photos on there on our on our website because a bunch of Russia is random Russian guys going through and kind of fight thing at the military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up let her photo shows are boy ...

as another member of the group we firmly believe that it's so important to have more people are aware of how to do this kind of things and most of the times it's not too hard I caught up with him and

bellmore cats the truth these researchers believe is on the Internet you just have to know how to look Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington rain rain goes a\nLot\nOf New York and Boston and then you have your listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court not a player as she that's right the athletic ran who may is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat was a shoo them made famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nSo they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they sign just one clear and been quarter and yoga broken after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at people although it has the\nElement of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'll come with a big part of the appeal with typing in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also it's a complex thing for them as as a brand\nBeen white Twenty years since there last basketball she made him\nYeah so they had it for a in Nineteen Ninety eight and it was a very short lived they signed just one clear and been Carter and that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal with typing in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind them because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year and like you had about six percent of the week wearing their shoes lassie oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay\n[laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed sixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started to an end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is that for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have it's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that you\nKnow we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that meant made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting ... brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of ... through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at Pomona signed\nThey have six and a half million to bind followers on Instagram so that's why this huge nice as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really lenient on their players accounts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n...
