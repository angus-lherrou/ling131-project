week\nAll right we're learning more this hour from the FBI about him number ... packages that were address to a democratic political figures next week\nAuthorities say five devices were sinking identical double lined manila envelopes each of them with the return address a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reporting today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either\nOkay so take me through this the FBI said there were five potential explosive devices that they are also reports of more\nThat's right so the FBI says that these envelopes were addressed to George Soros he's a billionaire a big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan as the package that was intended for Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right on not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however\nUh that the package it didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted eights a suspicious package that was addressed to her they say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late I'm not clear at this point but\nThe FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that uh it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know about at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI gets gets in its announcement earlier\nWell law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the one set the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder\nNow the FBI itself said that all of the explosive devices were mailed in these identical bubble wrap envelopes the address is on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her last name was ... was misspelled\nEach package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individual uh put stamped on it but didn't have to mail it now\nThe package addressed a former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed the FBI says to the return a address which of course is Wasserman Schultz now she says today that she didn't send these uh she says she's deeply disturbed by these packages are disturbed that it showed up in that her

Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt suicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life\nConducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nThe confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert mazes and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here\nRinged by tall mountains desert mazes and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide things got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash\nOf teen suicides seven over at school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly it it kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley\nThat's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep you know pick up a player bootstraps mentality Kathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids I think that we unfortunately [noise] think of\nMental illness instead of mental health and it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver I think there's also the issue of\nAccess to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have in our home 'cause my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes ... says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAs she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologist but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by it tried\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental\nHealth resiliency curriculum beginning in rates [noise]\nFortune ... middle school eighth grader ... leaves in the

shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid in for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community is watching all of this is car each school she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team

double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there's so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like salt husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and that's ... a national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morse is the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super\nPowerful voice they have

John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation asked Mac found dot org\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the combination and sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican\nRon Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you\nWell Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an interest partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nA I have nobody to call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the\nMulti year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interests of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was that that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen I'd never heard the term\nSpecial interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and Central American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWould not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts that they are\nThe people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the fact that they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific\nEvidence in this chair bad but it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect checkup a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats won caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say\nI Wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support the Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison grand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what ever read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products German homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is just sheer he was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I can start handling this so I'm trying to go through this\nAs a business person would be a problem solver gather the information ... agreement in our community we you know we all agree one of the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and attorneys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its fields competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the

she focused on women children and elderly as a prosecutor in Maricopa County in private practice and later as an advisor to governor Janet Napolitano\nK W sees Lou Gump spoke to ... about how the job of attorney general has changed in recent years and what she thinks mark Burnett which is focused on the wrong issues\nIt's talk a little bit about the role of attorney general which changed over the last ten Twenty years it used to be a fairly consistently bipartisan position now that seems to shift a little bit what is your understanding your your view of that\nThe attorney general traditionally in Arizona has been the least part is in a position in state government and I think we need to get back to that quite frankly uh as I watch you know our current attorney general sued to take away health care from Arizona and\nYou know he's suing to eliminate the only protections that exists for people with preexisting health conditions\nI I Know maybe because I was in health care for governor in ... it's going to impact us here you know the human regional medical center people lose their jobs if he's successful at taking away healthcare\nIt's estimated that Arizona could lose up to forty two billion dollars if his lawsuit is successful I think we need to go back to looking at an approach of issues that\nYou know how does this affect Arizona's\nAnd if it harms Arizona and guess what we need to be on the side that's fighting for our people\nApproach of issues that you know how does this affect Arizona's and if it harms Arizona and guess what we need to be on the side that's

need to be in that kind of litigation where we need to be you know on issues where attorneys general around the country are taking the lead like the opioid epidemic\nUm you know we need to be

action\nAnd the current attorney general all in the last year and one month um but boy other attorneys general are just you know ... taking storm a this issue to make sure that we can prevent the harm that's coming out of it\nBeing from Arizona you know that it's much bigger than just the Phoenix area or the Tucson area there are a lot of rural parts of the state that feel a little left out of the conversation um maybe even feel like the attorney general has nothing to do with their day to day lives or talk to people about why having some when they can trust in this position it so important\nWhat I've heard because I visited every county most of them more than once I'm what I hear from people is that you know they're not used to seeing the attorney general around any more um we used to have a tradition of an attorney general a ... on your side and we'd come out and not only the attorney general but staff\nWould come out once a quarter and meet in a library or another public space where people could bring their concerns in their questions or you know Arizona is one of the top ten targets for financial scams\nThat's in part because so many people choose to retire here uh and so we need to educate we need to mobilize we need to make sure that we're accessible right here in your own home town so that you we know what's going on there you know if there is a problem and a trend that we know you know who to go after\nA and secondly so that people know where to report things uh and the attorney general ... you should consider at your local lawyer because in fact that's

show has been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times the me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nAs she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and at ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid\nAn extraordinary amount of money for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you ...\nBack in Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor that also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now that subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear when we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not all the advent Halloween is likely to Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the ... costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversation should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk\nUs through some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black these in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these characters linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twentieth century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\n[noise]\nExclusively and black face [noise]\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow the portrayals of Asian American pie and think of Mickey Rooney ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against\nUs and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOr the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about that and the panel it's all white piano which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocent people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so that was brought a contact we always start in a store vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when you controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with\nA different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery that's maybe in your conversation\nWill be better served if you spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank\nYou so much for Louisiana over [laughter] I felt [noise]\n\n\nThis\nIs NPR News\nI'm Peter O'Dowd a young Saudi dissident living in Canada worked with ... before his death\nThank you well President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and she knew you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measure trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places that so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S when I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador there\nCountries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTransnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to reduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it's in the end is the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations actually much my pleasure [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News the\nCerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out the ancient part of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismisses does that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober\nBut researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections about twenty percent of the survivor\nThose MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico doesn't bug says they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum it's cruel than most people thought but these results were rave more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDon't send box says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's much harder noticed that I think that's the way scientists the neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation father bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts with Sarah but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved in cognition means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\nMom and says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have linked to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to all things
