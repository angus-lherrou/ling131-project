I I go to our children\nAnd I heard the Iraq into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to Lisa flasher Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmothers are with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time innocent guy this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but at the attack on\nOn everybody in a community and markets are strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both so you know this has many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials well I wouldn't have\nHad tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support for the families that\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate\nCrime well I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gotten my so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our school at our temple that our churches\nShouldn't have to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers out to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah thanks taxing\nAnd other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during that service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... she'll Lugar said he that he held a special surface to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and bunch\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with her boys and with our actions we can ensure that\nThe hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there were some people who might have been afraid to come out today I did yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put your\nBeen afraid to come out today as well\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back on my open\nAnd affirming you mean that everyone every once in a while because everyone is welcomes right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today what's it more than you expected we had a couple of ah\nFolks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they do not stay to worship\nBut they do to come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I do have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses and on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events uh because he was a police officer in white hall nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nTo it was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge\nTo give me the bowl ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony would be much being held in the presence of children hit very close to home well\nThis church has recently and kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind said started here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years really\nAnd is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where are you thinking okay what what I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that tiny hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind and it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you yeah have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for the children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son older and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and ... said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and ... and there were you were going over all these things are very zero through or a certain number of people to look at your front of\nA certain order field are you should be there because her zero or your caller\nMassey what about you I don't get the sense

Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood with its attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah I mean people were out in scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of a fix president

little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to the point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school with the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials we've known for a loan for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a more mature a wedding or\nSome of the\nTwo of them are always a\nSanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nFelt like people run this or this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you thank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you have actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood after the synagogue you also went to other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy

synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back events happening right\nSomething different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the ... solar and cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what I Am more than she does that I have no\n... and since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with beef without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that well\nYou mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks Asia thank you\nFor ...\nYou're listening to all

former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWill some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role in this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who are doing everything it get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff in a a good general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside

Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal attempt to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat Taco Bell ever spent

like Maria Elena Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nInto trail so he tells the plot that he's a moderate but when you see is voting rights act that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that\nAnd they just hear him and they say wow you know he found this theory that opponents Democrat sending the car so Powell is trying to change that you know they need information we need to provide them for me\nAnd they say wow you know he sounds like this theory that opponents Democrats ending the car so Powell is trying

bought we believe that this should be fair they focused\nOn a new built out area fruit and vegetable growers who are largely left out of the new trade agreement people like Republican tomato grower

who's area\nAnd um stuff fall you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of the incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but McCarthy Powell also worries that the people her party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at the polls\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to to loading type the last few days of the

years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed successes also undermined one of the basic theory that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you put it in them\nJobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you\nPut it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the ... long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS

could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and going\nTo a different way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhether the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want Rowan stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me relevance stable inflation\nEven if
