I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor take them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way but all he said was was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited oh well we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given up the phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining thanks for having me [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou're

I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boy hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students\nAt first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialized the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble but these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt orchard Mason middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to all\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nHow a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her on the crowded wall\nDeporting keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that and say what they're going through so they don't feel like it\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing the blues sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's got to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is car each school she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of its high school's football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide had no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSeen as a pillar suicide had no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that hurts so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes or husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at the demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating

that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump has been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts that we have just been experiencing the worst to cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing\nThat the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important
