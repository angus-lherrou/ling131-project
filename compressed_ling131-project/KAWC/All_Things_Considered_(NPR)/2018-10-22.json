Ford testify about what she said that now Supreme Court justice\nThe area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after ... Ford testify about what she said that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I felt it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and a half step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me\nBecause I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and\nThen he starts to take her genes off\nAnd then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on its than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on his shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us out at at that window was outside\nWe all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys at the party started touching another young woman who was\nAlso passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a\nShe was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching or he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told that your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and find out later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I\nI I don't know why we've kept quiet\nA quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nSomebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what\nWe've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise] how did your family take it when you told them [noise] well\nLet let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh\nThey were very receptive on their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it will happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it\nThat's what they told but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that she wouldn't have done it because he wouldn't have wanted to be on film is yeah we film everything you know what they would kind of looting too well how do you feel now that you've got an off your chest you know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when\nI regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people\nSome women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a salted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good\nYou know your piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help these women then but I didn't do it\nDumps hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many

Istanbul on October second now all along turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of killing the journalist the Saudis acknowledged it only Friday after denying it for weeks\nThey say the country's rulers knew nothing about the operation claim viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the aims of the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slowed she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from is down below come to the program thank you so to give us some context there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there\nYeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a fellow by turkey and backed by the Saudis\nSo essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government\nThink there certainly has always been a challenge in a a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now it's particularly directed against Mohammed bin saw him on a known as as MBBS and this is an eye on prince right now\nAbsolutely absolutely of who king Solomon designated as the air and twenty Seventeen are aired on I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns\nUh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades and I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish regional interests and so I think what we're likely to see from air to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on MBA\nAnd so I think what we're likely to see from air to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on NBS\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new air called\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring that pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nSustaining members are a big reason we've been able to
