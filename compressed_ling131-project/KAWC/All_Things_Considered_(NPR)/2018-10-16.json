Native American ancestry with very high confidence or we believe the error rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and even though we have a Native American ancestry you're over\n... you know you can hear that she's also again printing this point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nAnd can also here at least who one of members of the intended audience video is the president himself a lady responded to although he has\nAnd no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this I won't\nA million dollars\nFor trouble if you take the test so that shows you earn it is you know [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDon't merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up a million dollars he or she wants this money to go she said to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard at the end the war in went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with ah the aspirations we mentioned the choose eyeing a run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really\nRealistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had his taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty rate is going to kick off pretty much it's in the mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of those of us it's ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered

for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run\nAmelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae ... women being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this raid wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nAre definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated where trans individual could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only

officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age until you are [laughter]\nAnd I I mean it it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before\nAnd I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidate fit into our national political conversation which fields so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene I'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian vet\nGina yeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how do ... what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it mealy discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em and share point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they will with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nTo one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive\nSo I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene in a male you do as well to those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm moving a is a tale of war crimes\n[noise] she lost her family and for a time for freedom she found the courage to speak out about the atrocities against her now she has won a Nobel Peace prize conversation ...\nAnd education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is it reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're great ... of the ... they're getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government are trying to give people a you know\nSteve ...

security issue maybe she had to ... I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out her sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections in the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different past the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance Latin [noise]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat\nWonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt was just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put a fire pillow to sleep\nWhen this crime happens [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] so yeah that was pretty rough that wouldn't\nBe a violation today but back then ... says she wants good conduct credits those were days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder a serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can see institution so I'm not a shame\nYou know and it helped me with my own my own shame and I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV a carton and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so there for so here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in the basement\nSeen it all but he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get the prison with the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary sounds people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one at it in Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six cannot catch problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are ... sells a guard would watch separated from a station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night this is what President cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nUD humanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to wipe giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions\nOften lead the ending up in a cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nTomorrow how women running for president are making a difference in the way they are rough you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Jeremy hops him for his new book journalist Ben Bradlee junior went to one Pennsylvania county that voted twice for Obama and then for Trump and profile voters there are taught to I'm a woman for whom\nYou know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and it turns out he wrote me to come here and I had to yeah he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened his suspected murder will have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very with NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during questionnaires time with the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe chair to talk more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including toward Saudi Arabia\nAyesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammad bin ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person or since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle Middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nSo that was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nFord in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminal portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley within the oval office recently and she talked about Christmas rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals I Can't\nSay enough good things about Jared and Iraq I there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about Katrina and about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy\nWith questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation it open and transparent uh but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leader to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear\nAt some of these dealings are are not transparent\nUp but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports are that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed\nA fun NPR's Ayesha
