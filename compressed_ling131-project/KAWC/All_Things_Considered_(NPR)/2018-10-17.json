be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be two people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run\nA million ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we've we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um\nAnd and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin what try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um\nWe actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to el GB to people do you think that shapes your experience yeah\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it I've got you know some wonderful fellow than in turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nBecause then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the algae community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beat GQ candidate fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene I'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people\nAnd we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community in our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina in the mail you do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us\nI Want to thank all three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for

at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern

health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and it's a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign at out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care that's here\nIt's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the ... provisions that ... that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that had something to change the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his initiation will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization once\nYou're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nLoo Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare

minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic

nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like

Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and oh and answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he had clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis and Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nBecause even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that so just to ...\nThe officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nJust to parse that sat there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which should take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLynn centers in immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and the problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour

ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough

reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities on the panhandle in many cases gets old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises out a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks\nNot a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families any of them were just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings

in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speed one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid

much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speeds

the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me why people leave Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats inhalation and diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that\nRace is sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often times the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they can do that but like ... in showing in the past few days and it has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that kind of found someone church action\nOut there and missions as a group of ...\nIt has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents burned missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see the repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans all to the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources an opportunity to people have available to them it's really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone who's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about
