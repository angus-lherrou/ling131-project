Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican\nRon Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives\nIn your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and it's partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the\nLegal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it ends\n[noise] I I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the ... year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a company children and our family units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I tour to the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when we were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds is opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts that they are in twenty five times so I I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific\nEvidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravan they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not\nHelping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is they manufacture and controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison Hernandez down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest river homeland security most of these laws aren't under my major's diction\nThis next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of arthritis German homeland security most of these\nGuys aren't under my measures diction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that was a move forward and and working with my colleagues or jobs or agree with that I can start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would be a problem solver\nGather the information fine tears regret meant in our committee will you know we all agree wants to do this or that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want enforce our laws and we don't separate families so try to go three problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and that may be successful breeds success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and

things considered here on KBA WC\nDemocrat January contrary to the first time candidate for public office as she speaks to become the state's next attorney general contrary spaces incumbent Republican Mark burned which in the general election\nThe fourth generation Arizona and says a family tradition of giving is what first led her to a legal career where she focused on women children and the elderly as a prosecutor in Maricopa County in private practice and leader as an advisor to governor Janet Napolitano\nK W sees Lou gum spoke to ... about how the job of attorney general has changed in recent years and why she thinks mark Burnett which is focused on the wrong issues\nLet's talk a little bit about the role of attorney general which changed over the last ten Twenty years it used to be a a fairly consistently bipartisan position now that seems to shift a little bit what your understanding your your view of that\nThe attorney general traditionally in Arizona has been the least part is in a position in state government and I think we need to get back to that quite frankly uh as I watch you know our current attorney general sued to take away health care from Arizona and\nYou know he's suing to eliminate the only protections that exists for people with preexisting health conditions\nAh I Know maybe because I was in health care for governor in ... it's going to impact us here you know the human regional medical center people will lose their jobs if he's successful at taking away healthcare\nIt's estimated that Arizona could lose up to forty two billion dollars if his lawsuit is successful I think we need to go back to looking at an approach of issues that you know how does this affect Arizona's\nAnd if it harms Arizona's and guess what we need to be on the side that's fighting\nFor our people instead of against them what issues duty on the horizon you'd like to see a a bipartisan or a nonpartisan attorney general's office right now\nI'm my opponent has the attorney general's office in court defending secrecy of donors to the Koch brothers network so that they don't have to disclose their identity the same way that the rest of us do\nA you know we don't need to be in that kind of litigation where we need to be you know on issues where attorneys general around the country are taking the lead like the opioid epidemic\nUm you know we need to be collaborating at the attorney general's office with local law enforcement with local communities and going after the drug manufacturers and drug distributors and we've seen a little bit of action out of the current attorney general all in the last year in one month\nUm but boy other attorneys general are just you know ... taking storm on this issue to make sure that we can prevent the harm that's coming out of it\nBeing from Arizona you know that it's much bigger than just the Phoenix area or the Tucson area there are a lot of rural parts of the state that feel a little left out of the conversation um maybe even feel like the attorney general has nothing to do with their day to day lives or talk to those people about why having someone they can trust in this position is so important\nWhat I've heard it because I visited every county most of them more than once\nI'm what I hear from people is that you know they're not used to seeing the attorney general around anymore um we used to have a tradition of an attorney general a ... on your side we'd come out and not only the attorney general staff\nWould come out once a quarter\nA ... on your side and we'd come out and not only the attorney general staff\nWould come out once a quarter and meet in a library or another public space where people could bring their concerns in their questions or you know Arizona is one of the top ten targets for financial scams\nThat's in part because so many people choose to retire here uh and so we need to educate we need to mobilize we need to make sure that we're accessible right here in your own home town so that you we know what's going on there you know if there's a problem and a trend that we know you know who to go after\nA and secondly so that people know where to report things uh and the attorney general ... you should consider at your local lawyer because in fact that's what we should be\nAll right that's a January ... she's running for attorney general a Democrat

all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish in Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national\nUnemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent that's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash\nA decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee emotional yeah I'm sure it is crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on over here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nThen Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck current workplace policies at eighty see you again today Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes Ruben everything a little bit of everything\nThat eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs a little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflect the bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed\nMhm did\nThe ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that\nPoint was used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like he's me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nAre running\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrill heart [noise] Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off now go to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that day [noise]\nDrove him sick hurting\nWhen it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that day [noise]\nThroughout the Camp Six hurting the freeway enter\nOur tour guide is Jeff Rob he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left that we liked\nThe trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic\nJams hog it harms\nOur cars are driving by themselves on a crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost\nOf another logo United Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that

[noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate with three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that's historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing as fast as my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips in a down in restaurants more\nEli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that on Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around Labor Day an immoral Davis share a fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more effort to protect their spending more with us\nIt wasn't just consumers who are spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending\nTo a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular with high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number [noise] despite the big cut in business taxes\nThere is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people and businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing and car markets\nJacko also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now\nThe U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working and spending
