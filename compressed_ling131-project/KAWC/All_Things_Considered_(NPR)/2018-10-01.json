barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic work charging for faster loaded the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact of California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you want to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements some times include things like zero rating which is the deal\nWe have rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix stored database restrictions and these are all\nRules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed the net neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now the California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing that\nSo many things actually so it's on a political level California\nIs an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a

of who's in the oval office\nAnd the department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies while this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr the tech companies and the consumer groups

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro it looks like North America will remain a free trade zone after all late last night Canada agreed to joined the U.S and Mexico in an updated version of the north American free trade agreement it will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the U. S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deal ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever develop\nIn signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter\nCheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U. S. agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade dispute even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partner is ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico have reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night just hours before a White House deadline Walter do cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted\nAnd later the FBI has just days to finish its new investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh do\nQuickly you could do a polygraph of all three people involved and the alleged sexual assault you good polygraph all three of them\nMore on what else the bureau might do given the short timeframe that's in about Fifteen minutes here ... a devil you see\nToday is K.

investment opportunities firsthand institutions advisors employers and individuals choose T Rowe price T Rowe price invest with confidence\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know for change and I'm Ari Shapiro there have been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house the latest book by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book it's called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration alternately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well the real\nPattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy so they're shock there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge\nFor the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shock there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the apartment\nBut they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ... especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency it's supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nThis is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nDoing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think they'd be able to do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out of those are people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended this book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the bar and any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is with the same tornado that's going to come take her bart is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\nIt imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage she doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown\nSigned top net neutrality regulations into law and the train station has filed a lawsuit that California's new law classes with federal policy tomorrow here from the professor who came up with the term net neutrality you can ask\nYour smart speaker to play NPR or your local station tiny [noise]\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case I I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and limited scope according to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth with those additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case so I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and the limited scope recording to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth was additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't uh at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI good requested additional time if they're found new evidence new information about why the background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the request\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOh You're welcome most as I Do even as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government at the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president there sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place that Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued\nA challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this

have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the frogs case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber\nThis she's lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in

area where there are more ephemeral ponds warehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans\nAfter the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity explained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nA drug commonly used to treat the bone thinning disease osteoporosis could protect many\nMore older women against bone fractures that's according to a big new study published today by the New England Journal of medicine NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nAs we age our bones tend to get dinner and dinner and dined read at the University of Auckland says millions of older people break a hip

president elect of the American College of physicians\nWe're not going to reconvene and immediately changed the guidelines\nBut everyone agrees that older people should talk with their doctors about
