months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about the exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand is that usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressure so you're saying the economy remains strong such ... good for the stock market and economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are

shouldn't accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled a bit as\nHave emerging markets and the IMF\nGave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nOf course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S in China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the\nSell off for virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today\nAnd that some ... five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another crack at it and we'll see what happens let's say That's NPR's John Ydstie

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump at a rapper Kanye West met for lunch today one topic on the agenda gun violence in Chicago west told Trump he opposes stop and frisk police tactics\nThe president's ideas have different greatly from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nA different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nFew years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rates in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some butter gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI have directed the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fest is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means that turns out the opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk [noise] from says the widespread\nStopping and frisk getting a potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stops which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in we really\nHaven't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan at the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they uh get knocked and therefore chose to do nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former\nAnd that this new consent decree is more of the same But Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in we really\nHaven't had any keep from them and Cal now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore chose to do nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word of justice William loses stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more police and\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked\nAbout it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously you\nGuys even in the stories\nAcknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ab loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew is alive and those were the words from a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian Soyuz rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during an today\nThat liftoff had proceeded smoothly for about two minutes then came some real life drama\n[noise] I'm On my head and I have five cats and my family out of\nThe crew American the Hague and Russian Alexei option are safe after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that so we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station and twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nSo this was going to the American ... first time into space the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut\nWas a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this large and wood working together for a couple of years we've ran out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top\nWhat kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job\nSo they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched working together for a couple of years we've ring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely actor\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to isn't based today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong\nAnd then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows\nAnd then once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up and the different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want to apply\nIf they ... to come home and they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and has to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nIs interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a\nAs a more of a danger than others and that he had

crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference ... almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible
