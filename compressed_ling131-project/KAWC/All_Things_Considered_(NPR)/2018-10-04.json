Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor officer now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to have the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. jets inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures didn't Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds would find any child in our care for any parent\nHGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da Jess had custody of their parents and at the time the age I said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAt Central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database\nPerry of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child and our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated wild da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the age I said there was a central database of the locations of\nParents and their children at Central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children and anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chess does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the jets also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents [noise]\nOh yeah more than a

raised in the area\nThirty some years ago now make about Seventeen thousand dollars a year same as their parents but once you head across Dumont avenue everything changes\nBlack kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents making around twenty six thousand dollars a year to find out what happened on the other side of Dumont avenue people told me to go to church\n\n\nDavid Cay Brawley is one of the leaders of east Brooklyn congregations in his office he tells me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning of ... and the civilization burned out homes empty lot people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession than the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city governments sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the man in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was growing and we needed something that was much better for the

that can focus on more than just surviving the day to day probably points out that those quaint thirty thousand dollar near my house is built on land once sold for a buck or now valued at as much as

morning edition is everywhere else and yeah we got out of the euro and one roof compound ... reporting from bunkers dreaming alleys jungles and desert but most importantly\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it from Democrat to great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this and energize them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd us today Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this isn't a state of North Dakota All right that's right and I mean a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if you have an gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks I'm watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey note there the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone the did than tell me what exactly to do first and that until they're sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the prison we've used when I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the character spaces of bailout\nSo you filled out this form do you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called buck a way to buy my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question you\nKnow I think it's relevant because first of all the other one should learn from the V. so usually committee or what is taken oath and what is also trying to move to so it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking is\nIt's a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony that was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think ... moved confused that was passing out but the black no freeze means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you that it's a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job and that's a nice little\nChat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from an area [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just a share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years\nSo it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else so you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically I mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUh but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have\nBetter options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit and when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have\nBut it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it and is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others you know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector\nSo consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional and business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this is been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari thanks\n[noise]\nSupport for a Planet Money comes from

lines for us announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking\nPlot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw with examining of substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year\nSo the Sergei Skripal ... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what do these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic ah servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterm shrimp further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be falter misleading or the hackers

then we've been way\nIraq and young musical deer Evan Hanson about suicide and teen mistakes now young adult novel for everyone it\nSarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide she uses to actual canon to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized\nThat means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor what does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon rock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that are men grows within Iraq vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental block to realize that China impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming up through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to\nThe assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did it take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\n... part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fallback to actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] Sarah Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows congratulations
