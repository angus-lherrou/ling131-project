instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom\nWell what led up to the whole moment yeah so a pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\nRegimen type air to one uh he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department and especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case\nUm Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August to impose sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Bronson um that release came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier\nToday does this mean anything

grabbing headlined in a tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists they're suing can't because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark nice the he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia\nWhere did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February ...\nOr who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where\nDid this law come from\nIt was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that\nResulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way to federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that dislike disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to um be his opponents say that Brian ... is part of this process as secretary\nOf state who's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close\nWe have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work at the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ...\nElections in enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election process is our local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in\nThe may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this\nParticular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are\nCracking down on voting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that prime camp you\nThat was my knee the as the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber

Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office\nWhat was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal is like a Trojan up things and send it out or something I don't know I was for once upon a time you noticed down was ... been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the ... you would not that much of a surprise\nAs easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and I imagine it as some kind

was really easy to laugh about 'em into election not you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nYes if you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything Rodney just said this is not performance art he's not going to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels um he\nEven said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reached\nYes fans his fan follow him they're influenced by

Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us [laughter] and so many of you [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but\nTime I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth and value are determined by my parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know the it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously justice exits as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere were definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that you embody whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and not ...\nAnd being a woman in a context that was obviously justice exits as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there were definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quite right or I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nAnd daughter in the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and we said very good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the\nPeoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is that you talk white you this that and\nHeard a lot of that and gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a
