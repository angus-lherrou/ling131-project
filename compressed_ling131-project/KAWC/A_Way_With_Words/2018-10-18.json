Petersen thank you so much for being here to\nAlso here in Studio Arizona Public media dancing on ... and from our debate partners Joe Ferguson of the Arizona Daily Star in the ... are NPR sister station in Phoenix ...\nThey finally begin here are the rules for tonight's discussion each candidate will get a sixty second opening and closing statement in between our panel of journalists will ask questions from the list they prepared\nThe candidates have not seen the question the question is will be directed to one candidate who will have one minute to respond and the other candidate we'll have thirty seconds to robot\nIf one of our journalists out they follow question both candidates will have forty five seconds to respond well alternate who get each question and we will strictly enforced the time limits if a candidate repeatedly exceeds has a lot of time we may seed extra time to the other candidate in an effort to balance the opportunity for our audience to hear from both of them\nNow for opening statements first based on a drying beforehand Mr ...\nThank you very much and what's that goes on a public media and the journalists that are here to ah help facilitate this discussion uh\nThis election is important and uh there was a public meetings giving the voters an an opportunity to access and decide which candidate they could support in this very consequential midterm elections the consequential\nFor a lot of reasons but one reason that I Want to point out is the the deficit a night but two thousand eight team this year the deficit is going to be seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars\nThat that deficit is tied directly to the tax cuts that were given what eighty three percent of the richest in the country and the multinational corporations benefit from those tax cuts those are consequences that affect every American and when a majority in Congress\nHas an opportunity I Would it be part of that majority to begin to change some of these decisions that have been made that in the long term are going to hurt the American people\nThinking ... and now Mr Peterson your one minute opening statement\nThank you learn and thank you I was on a public media I was born into Dallas Arizona and grew up on the Indian reservations my roots run deep and the district living just outside of gerrymandered district does not make me care lesser blamed me to the fact that the district\nHas one of the lowest K. through twelve educational test scores and all of the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts this includes graduation rates\nIt does not blame me to the fact that this congressional district has ... per capita incomes in the country that does not blame me to the fact that our veterans do not receive adequate health care or the border\nIsrael with drugs and human trafficking nor does it want me to the fact that in the sixteen years the incumbent has no solutions to improve these conditions and raise the quality of life of its constituents\nUnlike my opponent I have no obligations to special interest groups\nWould never call for a boycott of the state I'm committed to work towards measurable change in the incomes ... education rankings veteran care\nAnd border security and eight term sixteen years my opponent and hasn't been unable to fix either because he is unable to her because he is doesn't care about politics has become a family situation and he has profited from it\nIs unable to her because he is doesn't care about politics has become a family situation and he has profited from it not the people\nThinking this appears in now on to the question did trick three includes a majority of our state border with Mexico so this first round of focus on issues related to border security and immigration the first question goes to Mr ... from a VPN Nancy monthly\n[noise] Mr getting however there are many people across this country who feel that undocumented immigrants uh especially from Mexico and Central America are real drain on our community resources what's your take on that and can you give me some examples but I I think\nWhat has to put that question and\nIn in the context of what what has occurred for the last Eighteen months it even prior to that we've had a a a a very divisive ah\nAttack on anything immigrant in this country by the president and others we've had an enforcement only policy or by the president and others and his apartment of homeland security what we have is a border\nIs very much an issue of economic the economic failure on the part of other parts of ... of Latin America but more importantly what we have at the border is\nAn opportunity and what we're concentrating right now is an enforcement and division it's no secret that everybody running for office goes and take the picture and all that lives in front of of the wall and says this is what I Want to do\nThe issue is much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just continuing to batter a dead horse about an issue that\nIs political rhetoric and really know solutions and be offered by the majority in Congress\nAnd is your parents and you have thirty seconds first fine\nWell obviously the the borders are complex situation it's going to take an enforcement of the regulations that we now have but it also involves a comprehensive immigration reform and I'm for providing away for for the people to be treated with dignity\nAnd where they can earn a path to citizenship and I'll discuss more of that later\nThank you the next question is from Joe Ferguson at the Arizona Daily Star for Mr Peterson\nTo Paris and the ... reports doesn't even hundreds of migrants being arrested in ... Arizona that served in the past few months what the federal Bruce into these mass meant mitigation patterns\nWould you be that question of course the ball patrol reports groups of thousands even hundreds of migrants are being arrested in Arizona desert in the past few months what's the federal tuition to these mass migration patterns\nSolutions to these mass immigration patterns is is threefold one\nWe have to provide border security we have to provide comprehensive immigration reform we have to provide a path for citizenship that includes dignity and we're promoting our red white and blue ... plan the red plan would be where people can\nUm announced that they are here and then there's going to be a moratorium on the um\nOn on deportations the white plan is where Congress will agree and pass and fund\nAnd impervious wall on the Mexico and us border and three when the wall or in the when the barrier not the wall but when the barriers complete then the path to citizenship can be established so that everybody does in our community can uh live here with dignity\nOr how they you know thirty seconds for a response\nThe issues is is is a is an issue that cannot be easily\nResolved with a ball it cannot be easily results\nThe issues is is is a is an issue that cannot be easily\nResolved with a ball it cannot be easily resolved enforcement only attitude decision is a is an issue that deals with poverty\nIt deals with persecution it deals with political upheaval and Central America in particular and it deals with with with the very fundamental native people we saw the moms and and the kids to flee situation\nAnd to look for an opportunity and the United states is viewed by many in the world is that opportunity so the fundamental issue is building a capacity within within the ... the countries that are sending people and people are fleeing bill capacity civil society rule of law long term uh\nUh local governments on the ... century's and and the and the federal government so it takes leadership to accomplish this obviously it hasn't been done to the degree that it needs to be in the past\nFive forty question comes from Ferguson this one is for Mr Pearce and Joe\nShapiro and this is one of nine districts in a country that border Mexico what does the law she can fail to understand about life and economics here\nWhen life and economics on the district are very important\nWashington fail to understand about life and economics here\nWhen life and economics on the district are very important\nWhat we need to have is someone who's going to work hard to improve the economic and living conditions in the district it saddens me when I go to know gallons it saddens me when I see parts of San Luis it saddens me when I'm In parts of of of of the\nSouth Tucson in the west side and to see the the state of the economic and living conditions in the district so I don't think a lot of people across the country understand that and that's something that we need to do\nIt takes leadership it takes working with a business and government and the the local institutions to improve the opportunities for our citizens to is to improve their wages\nAnd cigarette ... thirty seconds far as the stereotype about the borderlands and it is prevalent in Washington a among Congress and the leadership in Congress right now that this is a political issue and so people culture diversity potential\nAnd opportunity ... are not part of the equation this because this is political fodder in DC they can't take a picture to leave and never stop to understand both the history and the importance of this border region I\nThink Mr ... we have a follow up question now this one comes from the ... the county's indicate which candidate you'd like to answer first as a minder both candidates will have forty five seconds to answer that question\nA mystery hunger among all of your legislation that you have supported and tried to put forth on the border are what are you most proud of and what what has been your biggest accomplishment\nI thought I thought the the effort the legislative efforts are\nHaving been\nAccepted as legislative effort and when I began this process very few supported that moment of changed considerably in the last four years and we have some opportunities\nThe successes are convincing the previous administration about the need for stimulus packages ... son at least so that we could start to build up that infrastructure\nThe quarter going from the valley is a Tucson or that now receive twenty five billion dollars very proud of that and so it has been a consequence of having someone in the White House that was appreciative of that\nAnd supported the local communities are legislatively it's got to be comprehensive reform and uh so far has been an appetite by these majorities in Congress even tackle that\nI Need to stop you there Mr Peterson yeah forty five seconds to respond [noise]\nAs far as uh the question that Mr motor sports just huh yes certainly well one thing that um\nThe incumbent has failed to tell it says that he had very little to do with the that money going to the border communities the other legislators worked very hard at that and and he's a\nHappy to be in on the on the goodies on that\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned that that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nThat includes our segment on board or related questions we now turn our attention to issues related to the environment the first question is from a VPN Nancy Montoya different instruments or to have a reminder one minute response please\nRamos how ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water um if they're good at ...\nI'm going to have ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water on Mr ... to ... um about the Colorado River watershed odd situation what should be the federal government's role\nI in having some kind of a drought contingency plan what should the federal government's role will be in that\nI think it's a federal government's role was all got to the Colorado River has to be full active\nAnd right now just got a city back under this administration and see what the state of Arizona and their own stumbling around them what to do with a water management plan for the state given droughts\nGiven scarcity given the finite reality of that resource or the federal government to step in and provide guidance the Colorado is a resource for Seventeen million people countless businesses\nFrom here to Southern California and be on\nAnd so it is a resource that needs to be preserved we can not allow uranium mining around the Grand Canyon to preserve that water source and we cannot let this assistance to continue to happen without having contingency plans and this inquires choices and this requires a\nUser's a to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a ... step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this water and manage it much better than we're doing now\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for response\nWill do the water issue is a state issue that needs to be resolved between the participating states in the central Arizona project\nOf preferred that the federal government not not be involved\nAnd as far as the local sources of water currently we are to the city of Tucson is on CAP water and my biggest concern is the contamination level\nSo I think one of the biggest things we can do is for a legislation that will create a national standard for for where the water quality and this is one thing that is missing in and we need scientific help on this\nThank you now question from ... from the Arizona Daily Star this one is for Mr Peterson\nPearson how ... works in Congress to prioritize what are often seen as western issues such as federal versus private land use\nPrivate land use 'em should first be taken up by the state one of the things that are I Would be in favor of is that the federal lands more of those federal lands be turned over to the state so that this could increase the educational trust when an increased revenues from the state trucks funds\nAnd with so much of the federal lands are in the state being controlled by federal and a\nTribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the say trust lands and I think we should also\nSwap out land that that should be in the state trust land some of our state trust land is the name of proving ground so we should change a swap land out so that that land that we can't use right now that some of the human proving grounds be part of the state trust land so creative things like that should be done that would increase the revenue to find our schools\nAre highly you have thirty seconds for for\nThe public lands in Arizona and along the southwest are essential\nAnd a oversight by the federal government is essential\nRight now this administration has made the public lands uh uh one dimensional resource extraction oil gas mining period\nAnd that's a are public lands and our waterways as well like the Colorado or a run national resource and I think that the prospect of the federal government could bring to this is that we need to protect those that he'd be conserved ... what do they need to be conserved and more importantly as we look at climate change\nAnd that reality and as we looked at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands\nIt'd be conserved and more importantly as we look at climate change and that reality and as we looked at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands becoming valuable in terms of how they fit into that picture\nAnd remind you will stick to the time limits any uh overcast will result in a penalty later that sinister Hama this one is trying to tell them anything from our NPR sister station in Phoenix ...\nHave to have two questions first or do you favor Arizona implementing strict water conservation throughout the state and secondly in a follow up how would you work with the Arizona Governor to balance out our water needs with our gross\n[noise] yeah the ... the the domestic use the household use of water are in this state has increased ... actually is we have grown in population\nAnd and that has to be accommodated and and the issue of the use of water by mining companies has to be accommodated this has to be looked at in terms of how much they use how much certain ... certain crops used in terms of how\nThe high use of water they had that has to be a factor and and and the governor and\nOther elected officials must begin to look at those options of those hard choices that they're facing a I think to ignore the fact that this finite resources going down is a mistake another thing I Would do is this a shared water a permit that is given to ah to developers like along the ... that the court just went for\nAssured water seems to be has no criteria to it a assured water should really mean that scientifically assured water and I think many times they're handed out as part of a development agreement when in reality there and our water we're losing\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds farmers thought\nWell we're going to be fighting all over the world for water and it and in Arizona we really need to address that so one of my biggest concerns is local\nAnd that local concerns involved or water table which at the moment has too many contaminates contaminants and this problem needs to be addressed because if there is a drought situation Tucson is going to be one of the first ones to be suffering from this\nI think the question in front of ... for Mr Peterson\nYou balance the urban and rural needs in this district that includes metro Tucson\nSome Phoenix suburbs plus vast stretches of sparsely populated town how would you balance is all out\nWith the needs of the district are similar in that we all of the areas in the district require\nAccess to jobs they require access to quality education so these opportunities that exist in the difference a district are not unique to a new urban area as opposed to a rural area\nSo we need to provide resources in in both urban and rural areas that are going to be beneficial for youth\nProvide a job opportunities increase opportunities for them to\nTo do better in life and to improve their standard of living in an economic and living conditions\nThis really needs to be done on the reservations that needs to be an older small communities and this takes cooperation between the business sector of the private sector government and educational institutions so that takes a lot of work that takes a lot of cooperation to in order to do this\nThinking this or how they you have thirty seconds they\nCreate a balance and I and I think what was Seventy percent of the population is in the urban areas in this district email\nAnd Tucson primary and but that's only thirty percent of the land mass Seventy percent of the ... rural smaller communities in rural areas and what's needed there is not just the issue of access is the issue of infrastructure and the the issue of we catch it a health care\nBasic services broadband even get into those communities and so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of of the federal government to provide\nThank you Mr ... how are you there and we did a follow up question often related to the environment is some kind of Tron or district or issues related to a congressional districts three is on comes from Nancy Montoya [noise] I'm\nFrom Mr Pearson it's been a lot of the political reality is that a an elected official at the federal level is only as powerful as the committees you get placed on a if you are like that or what specific committee would you say to be appointed to in order to help this district\nWell first of all in helping this district I can help the district most\nFrom working from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress\nFrom working from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress I understand that you have to buy yourself a position on a lot of those committees but I Will work locally fairly by yourself\nWell I've understood that some of the positions you have to contribute money to your uh to the leadership to get a position\nSo I'm going to start locally and improve the economy and the living conditions in the district as best I can and I'm going to do the best I can to improve and gain access to committees um in in ... in Congress what committees\nWell the education committee is an important one we need to get more funding uh for here and also the um education or the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on the immigration reform\nThank you Mr could hardly yeah forty five seconds\nSort of re elected will repay the committee say have\nAnd that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority I Will be chairman of the national Resources Committee\nAnd the second most senior member of the education and workforce committee so to some of the things and legislation concepts\nThat President majorities for the last eight years and not allow even to to be hurt or a committee hearings will now have an opportunity to be debated and go through regular order if I have that opportunity and I'm reelected ... that I Would stay on the committees that among\nThinking now for the remainder tonight's debate or panel will be asking questions covering a variety of issues facing the district and the nation you know for ... years on Daily Star question now for Mr ...\n... am glad you mentioned regular order Congress hasn't passed the fall but for your budget in a very long time that it passes a bunch of short term temporary measures you know and it's continuing resolutions he's get federal agencies little room to plan to make changes to get Congress and the president a tool for negotiating policy\nWould you advocate for or against the pattern and bought a budgeting\nAgainst I think one of the things that the house of representatives has to do as a poll equal member of Congress and up an important responsibility for the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget\nAnd to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money or you haven't done that just been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under the continuing resolution till December seventh right now and nobody could plan\nWe don't have an infrastructure bill we don't have a transportation bill we don't have a farm bill and uh I think that the American people deserve a much better they deserve some consistency and some ability to know\nWhat that decision is the impact on them for that year and following years and we're not doing that\nIt's your parents and you know have thirty seconds for response\nWell obviously we all would like a balanced budget at the federal level the problems are many in designing a budget\nWhat needs to be done as you need to get agreement among both parties that we're going to be at a certain spending level and to take into consideration unfunded liabilities those are going to be hitting us we have a future liabilities in terms of health care for elderly\nAnd so it's it's a difficult situation but we need to work hard on that\nQuestion now from ... from the money's got this question instruments your Pearson\nOr border towns and the the three were hurting economically um prominent businesses have shuttered main streets are drying up and go ... Douglas and sudden Louis\nThey're hurting economically a prominent businesses have shuttered main streets are drying up and ... Douglas in St Louis [noise]\nSo what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to the main streets well that's\nA very important problem that we have all along the border and and the border cities what we need to do and what I have spent my life doing is working with small to medium sized businesses\nAnd working within the community within the community organizations the nonprofit boards that I worked on the grading the consensus on solutions to the problems so one of the things that we need to do is work with the public sector of the private sector and the educational institutions in the community so that we can find ways to\nSolve the problems in terms of a growing the economy and you need to create an environment that will that will provide for businesses to girl\nI Will put a lot of energies into promoting business growth throughout the district and we need to create more educational opportunities this involves training our students with vocational training so they can\nAdvance in their in their careers and and we can attract more employers to provide better salaries\nMichigan Javier thirty seconds\nFor you the the border to build that I referenced earlier had a major component of economic development and and I think that it's a good time to talk about investment because part of this whole discussion is a magically it'll happen no there\nAt the role the federal government has an area like the border that you pointed out those needs is to invest in it ... device to fix those ports of entry or to work\nIn order to lift and diversify the economy along that border it's an investment strategy and by having an investment strategy then you begin to develop the economic development activity that needs to happen on the border without\nWithout it without an investment the federal government which has occurred for the last decade we continue to sit around poodles and our terms and hoping something will happen that's to be an initiative\nAnd now question from Arizona Public media in asking this question for Mr Gadhafi again and one minute response thirty second our bottles from Mr Pearson\nMr guinea have you been arrested for a protesting a some federal policies\nAnd you speak harshly about the president and about the Republican Party how does that serve your guest strict\nWell I think it it serves under the fence said you know I I said before I wasn't elected to Congress to be a potted plant I have a voice and I think that voice is representative of the majority of the district and I use that voice and and to point out\nUh what Trump is doing enough varieties of an arena is I think my responsibility\nTo question and to be an effective opposition to some of the initiatives that the Republican majorities are doing it in Congress and the thing is they're not doing I think that's my responsibility as well because if if we are going to talk about change in the future then I think people need to know where you're coming from\nWhat's your position is and not hide from it and I I think people that know me know that that I don't have a problem telling people what my position is and I don't have a problem opposing things that I think are hurtful to the district and we'll aggravated situation even more worse than it is right now", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "18"}
