wavered radio dot org\nHello you have a way with words\nHow fast or on the front Tallahassee, Florida\nI have to open a welcome what's up\nI'm a social worker and say you can imagine I talked to people a lot of men doing this for twenty costs here I've had several professional on personal experience it over the years where when I Am ...\nI'm from talking to start mouthing my word violently and it's sometimes distracting but it's also kind of intriguing look I'm Wondering if you're familiar with is is there a word for it anything can tell me about it\nAnd so are they listening with a particular intensity or they do they have a hearing\nThey're very focused now I've I've wondered maybe this helps them learn and help out and buy ...\nNow I work with that's with mental health background is an idea has something to do with my mother is up there now that have called me about something called ... which is a question of another person's word settled or not and I'm ... ...\n... very intensely and they will be losing my mouth\n... and look for mouthing what I'm finding\nThese our colleagues are clients clients [noise]\nUm you don't sound like a slow speaker to me that that you're speaking to slowly for them\nI don't get that than I Am I not contact persons sometimes that can be a ... okay good so I Wonder sometimes are they just not following that might be able to share it with complex or you know maybe at me\nBut it happened in enough different satellites that I I started to believe our pet but\nThere's gotta be some ... ... ... not enough people that do that mhm that this has gotta be something [laughter] whether it psychiatric disorder or a way for people to process information I have no clue and I couldn't find anything yeah when I started looking into that I Would\nSay dean dean on both of those ring the younger the youngest bell okay [laughter] being a little you know it's a pretty good guess I'm not an expert in this but as I understand that the clinical diagnosis doesn't require that they've ... the words and it can also be used to describe\nWhen they're anticipating your words or trying to see them at the same time or even when they repeat them just a fraction of a second after you save them\nSo but there's another word which is related which is\n... uh P. A. L. I. L. A. L. I. A. and this is when someone just repeats the last one or two words of what you're saying and again they can just mouths than to themselves they don't have to yeah vocal chords for three Powell yes\nSo you had one of those words and there's a second word but in general there's another theory here that I've read a little bit on again I'm not an expert in a clinical diagnoses for these kinds of speech behaviors\nBut his whole mirroring and the idea is that when you mirror someone else's actions including their speech and the shape and form of their words in their mouth you better understand what they're saying because like you can mirror somebody said tennis serve you\nCan move your arm in the same way and that can I help you understand how they successfully hit a ball in a difficult situation or yeah being a little more expert yourself and it's the same supposedly with the words that people are say so in a in an aspiration where someone has a hearing impairment or where\nWhen you mirror someone else's actions including their speech and the shape and form of their words in their mouth you better understand what they're saying because like you can mirror somebody said tennis serve\nYou can move your arm in that same way and that can I help you understand how they successfully hit a ball in a difficult situation or get yeah being a little more expert yourself and it's the same supposedly with the words that people are saying\nSo in a in a region where someone has a hearing impairment or where they're really just not getting the words repeating the words can help you have that second chance to re hear them but kind of in your own yeah\nYou know we were talking about diagnosis and and I think at the last thing you said grant makes a lot of sense to me that they're not necessarily a path I'll let you know mom I mean one of the listeners I Know on the planet does this and I think it's just her intent\nOf listening to another person she's she's very very present and she will do that\nStephanie women do this or they anticipate in your words they're trying to predict what you're about to say\nLike a final\nAnd how accurate do you think they are did they get the words are just kind of the lips kind of farm loosely moving along to what you're saying\nYou know honestly I'm trying to be cracker where ... ... can make a conquered them I'm not sure I can answer that because if I let it distract me then I'm not able to how I ended up that way possible\nMhm I Know what you're talking about I had a co worker and they do this and I'm trying to avoid pronouns and they would do full sentences of pretty much everyone they spoke to\nAnd their lips didn't match the words at all and it was like little worms ... on their face [laughter] very intelligent and very competent at their work and leave you know regular human being as far as I ever knew and and it was just I guess their way of understanding better\nAnd I'm sure there's a little bit of an under ... when I was young or one of my older brothers you quickly that Iran ... ... ... who were trying to rip out loud every word I had some sort of a little bit of that from my childhood that annoyed by there's\nOne more theory is worth considering and you might Google it to see what you can even look in your professional tax on this it invoke this idea that humans are constantly calculating the odds we are certainly in small ways in large ways trying to predict the future\nAnd from Jack in Caroline Raymond proud sponsors of wayward aimed at the nonprofit the producers and distributes this program\nI'm Jeremy hops an adult film actress Stormy Daniels told CNN about her first meeting with Donald Trump before he was president\nIs talking about yourself and on my work and I'm like so much to take that magazine in Spain\nAnd I'll never forget the look on his face [noise] I don't think I Would have stuck in that might not\nNow she's got a new book out the talks to us next time around here and\nJoin us for hearing now tomorrow morning from tend to noon Iran K.

[laughter] ... you know for a long time I've used the expression reading mortality your book mortality I think I Would use it on the show a couple of times and I may have learned it from her there was a piece in the Boston Globe many years ago but the idea is when you have that\nThat dawning moment that you're never going to get ... you want to read before you die yeah and I have a real me with the stock of books next to my bed which I think it's up to forty now oh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah and to just see them on the shelves it's it's like a memento Maury\nYeah I have to tell you my rule is they used to be a hundred pages and now it's instant like you have to impress me\nChapter one page one and you're not even fifty no I'm not even said I Will tell you why because I give a lot of books that chance based on recommendations and people have terrible [laughter] I mean though that's obviously just a joke but the truth is that it takes me a while to figure out who in my world\nReally has taste like made so my will try books that somebody recommend hoping they're they're my literary ... anger and that what they like I like so I get a lot of books\nThat on uh uh yeah this is terrible and this person does not match me in their tastes and inclinations would be really interested to know what our listeners have to say about that you're given the call eat seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three tell us when do you give up on a book\nOr as an author a novelist what kind of shop should people be giving you should we give you a chapter two ten eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven through your email words that we would radio dot\nHoping they're they're my literary ... and that what they like I like so I get a lot of books that I don't uh uh yeah this is terrible and this person does not match me and their tastes and inclinations\nWould be really interested to know what our listeners have to say about that\nYou give us a call eat seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three tell us when to give up on a book or asthma and author a novelist what kind of shop should people be giving you should we give you a chapter two ten eight seven seven Ninety nine Ninety six seven through your email words that we would radio dot org although we have a way with words\nHey this is even I'm calling from Maryland\nI even we're in Maryland are you I'm In Baltimore in Baltimore okay welcome to show would you mind Steven\nI have moved around a lot and for part of my life I Lived in Nevada and once I left Nevada nobody said now that [noise]\nSo what I mean when I moved to North Carolina kids on the bus would call it Nevada and I have gotten and many high because of\nBecause you know I was from Nevada and I knew the way it was supposed to be pronounced and seems like everyone else in the world as Nevada so I was wondering I Hope I'm not wrong but is it possible that I'm thinking correctly or the world wrong [laughter]\nAre you saying that you got in Fitz fights on the bus because they mispronounce Nevada\nNever as I Know still haven't been in one of those in my life I'm no just more a me kind of screaming at kindergarten for mispronouncing [laughter] just pronouncing the state I don't know why it offended me so much but it it truly did\nWhen you were screaming a kindergarten you were also gender Gardner writes\nWe can do with that\n[laughter] imagining a high schooler shouting I knew when I was [laughter]\nI I was probably like second grade and a really felt like I had to defend Nevada from being called in Nevada\nYeah right ... where you can tell people that if you're in that state that's how you should be pronouncing it sure day I grew up in Kentucky and I have to confess that I pronounced it like your friends in North Carolina\nNevada I never knew anything different until just a few years ago and now I'm training myself just seeing the van and because I run into so many people from that state who are very very insistent that it's in a in fact I think the Nevada\nTourism authority so little and the one I rented yeah hey yeah in some in some of their materials they won that word to get out there in Nevada\nNow my story is even worse I grew up in Missouri and there's a town that spelled the same but it is pronounced ... Vita so for me the state was paid for very long time because that's how you pronounce the talent Missouri well not so sure there are people from other states have a similar problem people from Hawaii\nUm most of the country doesn't see it with that stop in there\nAnd people from Oregon uh bits not Oregon or or ... you know it's Oregon ... ready to die I ... I was thinking about that yeah they have the same problem and tons of local place names luck you're never going to correct everyone on this [laughter] you might just hold on to like secret knowledge like a magic spelled you have and they don't just\nBecause you might just find a way to relax and just enjoy the fact that they're talking about a steep that you love and tell them really wonderful things about Nevada since they came up\nUm I guess I can let it slide but uh it's good to know that you know in the in the context of the state that I'm correct\nYeah yeah you are correct and everyone in Nevada like cheering now [laughter] ... thank you for your call where we're with you on this you've got the right pronunciation I Would try to pick your battles and don't fight kindergarten nurse stock that [laughter] but otherwise good on yeah All right\nFind a way to relax and just enjoy the fact that they're talking about the state that you love and tell them really wonderful things about Nevada since they came up\nUm I guess I can let it slide but uh it's good to know that you know and that and the other states that I'm correct\nYeah yeah you are correct and everyone in Nevada like cheering now [laughter]\n... thank you for your call where we're with you on this you've got the right pronunciation I Would try to pick your battles and don't fight kindergarten nurse stopped that [laughter] but otherwise good on yeah All right [laughter] very month I think Steven by by\nEight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nAlthough it will come away with words Hi\nThis is Brad calling from South central PA\nSouth central PA welcome to the show\nWhat are you thinking about linguistically today\nI work at a trailer shop with a bunch of mechanics and I've noticed that a few of them is an expression like if you want it to get twenty seven screws it say twenty couple [noise]\nAnd um I had a cat or anywhere else before and I asked them about it and nobody seems to know where it came from so I thought I'd ask you that\nInteresting and are they all from that same part of the country\n[noise] I think so mhm\n[noise] so instead of twenty seven they would say twenty capital\nAnd would that be\nThe same for twenty three twenty five [noise]\nSo it's kind of like saying twenty or twenty I was OK yeah some odd cents in Somalia yeah what's really interesting I think you might have found what I Would call them on polished diamond here um because if you did go round on this term I can find no slaying dictionary or dialect dictionary or\nAny linguistic research that has touched upon the idea of using couple attached to a number in this way to represent some unknown quantity I mean obviously obviously couple on its own can sometimes being two three or even for but it attaching it in its way to uh numbers really unusual\nWhen I look at the top on the Internet and newspapers and discussion forums I find that looks like a nice tight circle\nOf usage in places like Maryland Virginia York, PA and he's very PA and Winston Salem North Carolina Winston Salem is kind of the outlier here but you could draw a kind of odd shaped oval around all the cities which might suggest that there's a geographic\nNature to it I Need a lot more data to prove that so it's if I had the time I Would be spending a couple of days trying to figure this one I think you found something they fear a couple of days really interesting\nYeah yeah [laughter] yeah I Would really well established is the term couple three mhm which yeah which is just kind of across the United states north couple three meaning a few meaning someplace between two and four it's it's odd", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Yuma", "day": "04"}
