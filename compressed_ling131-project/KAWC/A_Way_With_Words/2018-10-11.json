know it actually thought of it is a term and then in in the hobbits\nCongressman logical for years and now in the street on a true\nYou know if I took a political recently the speaker of the work and it sent describing a some more [laughter] you know I don't know\nWhere you know this is happening\nOK okay this is good you've you've really hit some nights I'm mile markers on the progress in the inter relationships with a different kind of trolls that we have here let me see if I can add a few more a mile markers to kind of this map that you've got for troll\nFirst ... troll is ancient goes back to least old Norse in a variety of different forms referring to some mythological\nDescribing a somewhat more power to you know I don't know really you know this is happening\nOK okay this is good you've you've really hit some nights a mile markers on the progress in the inter relationships with a different kind of trolls that we have here let me see if I can add a few more a mile markers to kind of this map that you've got for troll\nFirst ... troll is ancient to go back to the least old Norse in a variety of different forms referring to some mythological creature often ugly often vaguely magical often I think that you didn't want to encounter\nThink of ah [noise] the the trolls and like a ... ... ... where there was a troll under the bridge or the ... yeah uh so did the troll goes way back but\nLeader and it's a separate instance of it and it has nothing to do with a mythological creature\nThe French came up with a troll meaning to bomb casts about\nOr to kind of scan for something or to slowly look for thing and we borrowed that troll into English and we use it primarily or did in fishing where you\nYou dangle debate over the side and your boat slowly goes down the tremor across the lake and you try to attract fish to slowly moving bait and you bring them and that's troubling\nAnd so we fast forward to the Internet I'm very early on in the history of the Internet it's a big social phenomena people started\nDoing what we now call trolling which is saying outrageous things\nSometimes that they didn't believe in order just to get a rise out of other people to get their goats so to speak or to just to buy their chops\nAnd missed trolling comes specifically from the fishing kind of ... which is you throw something outrageous out there on the Internet and see who bites maybe it's going to be a newbie who doesn't know that you're a big jokester maybe it's going to be somebody on the other side of the political spectrum who you just know it's going to be ... at the ... the thing that you said that you don't even really believe in\nBut obviously people know about the mythological so it's a very soon people who do trolling which comes from fishing were called trolls with the idea that they were\nUgly undesirable beast that I'm more causing all the mayhem and you didn't really want them around out that while yeah right [laughter] I think man the language borrows words don't stay themselves they they transform they modify and when we have\nSimilar words a lot of times the meanings intersect and we borrow from both streams in order to make a new stream\nWell that is absolutely fascinating I recognized that language my stomach I didn't expect this [laughter]\nYeah so the Internet trolling where you just say outrageous are dumb things on purpose in order to irritate her aggravate other people dates to at least the early Nineteen nineties a lot of times people will credit\nOf the news group ... urban but I've actually found it earlier than it's ever was ever mentioned in that news group in other places in using that in the in the news groups\nWell what's on cable TV with some regularity\nYes well it's mainstream now I'm not surprised that you heard it on cable news or ... feet on the news here is utterly mainstream because the Internet as mainstream movies we've been an Internet Society for going on Thirty years now\nRight and as you said the speaker of the house he is the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the they'd creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture when I have Internet trolls you know I think if somebody coming out from the dark nether regions\nThere's this there's this incredible period there where they think this is important Harry the where the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing\nGoing on Thirty years now right and as you said the speaker of the house he is the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the they'd creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture when I have Internet trolls you know I think somebody coming out from the dark nether regions\nWell there's this there's this ... period there where they think this is important to Harry to\nWhere the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing related in other ways\nBefore it arrived to the Internet idea of trolling so you can see people trolling for dates ... going to the mall and trolling for trouble\nOr trolling for information\nAnd there's another kind of correspondence here with the people that people often bring up which is trolling T. R. A. W. L. which is another kind of fishing we just throw it a wide net and see what comes in and so that further kind of pollutes our understanding of the origins of the term but fortunately this one has been fairly well research\nI find some new things every time I looked into it because new things digitized constantly\nAnd we have a pretty firm understanding of where this comes from now\nThank you very much Harry yeah thanks so much for calling but she ate it caused again sometime I Love your daycare much take care of things for the\nCall is eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three [noise]\nWe asked folks to tell us their terms for\nTaking a bath without really taking a band is sort of like a navy shower GI shower yeah yeah or just bash in your possible ... um we got a tweet from someone named true blue who said we call it ... not an entire bass Jesse important parts\nAlso leaving home without meeting and putting unclean closes called putting icing on gingerbread\n[laughter] icing on duty but I like that too okay I'm not quite sure didn't find by itself right yeah\nYeah but if you're putting the icing on you're putting on your clothes\nYeah [laughter] talk to us on Twitter WMA y W O R D hello you have a way with words\nYeah Hi this is Jeffrey calling from Gainesville, Florida\nJesse welcome thanks\nGrew up in northern Minnesota and there are there was this phrase that I heard and I haven't heard it anywhere else um and it was constructed like they would say oh for", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "11"}
