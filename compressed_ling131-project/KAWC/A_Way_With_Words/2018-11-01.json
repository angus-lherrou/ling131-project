also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds he wants to organize how we understand and observe the ever changing formations up in the sky and he wanted to do it in a way that was scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera\nIn it he proposed the classification system for clouds and he drew on his school boy Latin\nAnd came up with the main categories which were serious strata and cumulus not serious comes from the Latin for hair or temporal strategy is comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds and these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody at always seen but never really classified that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and look Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nCulture was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to\nGo to win so far as to write poems based on those names and some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's the half\nAnd he argued that the Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed and he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kind of hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist forge the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his house\nRichard handling in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist forge the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London there's a historical marker that says Luke Howard numerous clouds lived and died here know that may not clouds\nThat will be ... dream of when we come up with a word we want the acclaim recognition that knowledge um right going to be part of history right and he got that ... is your fan yeah I Know I met any of my dining his eyes with heart disease and blood or if the Howard\n[laughter] yeah forget the house [laughter]\nI never knew that story I just I just thought some scientists came up with yeah these names but we still use them today\nYeah absolutely and they're not intact and other languages right they are modified to fit the different languages that they've\nBeen borrowed actually I don't know that there is it pretty clear system of classification of class and I don't know\nSo I like how it plugs into in the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old saw about the red sky or when I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to happen a little later with\nOur weather exactly trace this guy with the painters fresh the wins around using little rushed talking about serious clown yeah\nAnd what I also love about this is that it was a way of using language to impose order\nOn something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was with someone who who saw differences in clouds in South patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nI have often thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence to humans that they might actually call us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans to weed sort organized we classify and if you were to think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with the things that we say the things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our community about\nSetting these boundaries and then this is a box and all of things of this type go in that box I\nHave to write the class is higher so I really like that and of course language is key to that right in ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across the passions that talks about language in a way that you really enjoy we want to know and we want to share it

Shelley the poet all these people were inspired by this whole idea of classifying a clouds\nAnd purchase Shelley wrote a poem called the cloud and it's long so I'm not going to read the whole thing but I'm getting read the first a standard which will give you a taste of it\nI bring fresh showers for the Thursday flowers from the seas and streams I bear light shade for the leaves when late and they knew they dreams\nFrom my wings are shaking the abuse that wake in the sweet buds everyone when rocked to rest on their mothers breast and she dances about the sun\nI we owns the ... of the lashing hail in white and the green planes under and then again I dissolve it didn't rain and laugh as I pass in thunder\nAnd it's so beautiful and rhythmic in so much imagery and and she'd be a poem that's taught when you're talking about personification in English class it's really a lovely upon that goes on and on and that's\n... and the public called at the clouds the clouds thanks parts of those beautiful call us seven seven nine to nine nine two seven three", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "01"}
