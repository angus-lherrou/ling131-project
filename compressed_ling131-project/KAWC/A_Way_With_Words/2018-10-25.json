email words\nThat we would radio dot org hello you're on the way with words\nAt my name is ... and I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show that's only how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a bit sea bug\nCrazy isn't bad the bugs [laughter] and now crazy that\nIs sad thing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she would say that part of it is crazy over this [laughter]\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as the north I've not heard it even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term Betsy bug it all\nNow and I had no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a bad thing [laughter]\nWell we can tell what a Betsy bag is it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's it's kinda\nBad big is your thumb and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle but it's also called abet sea bug or best bug or Bessie bug\nAnd um you see this phrase crazy as Betsy bug or different variations of that that throughout the south and nobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like a you know when you disturb it it makes it kind of\nReally like a little running when you when it gets annoyed with you\nKnow like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a ... you know they're pretty sizable and I'm In this beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kind of well maybe maybe you're right\nIt is [laughter] so\nThat's where there were there and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nThey are going to say to me I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us\nToday thank you so much I'm so happy live folk and with both of you okay for work and I kept listening as well thanks who I thought I actually hello you have a way\nWith words a little joke from will from Wyoming Joseph welcome to the show how can we help you I have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her power as a desirable\nI have a question about sub par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on our power as a desirable thing for states that you want to find yourself in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under our\nIs not something you want to find yourself\nRight right right\nAll right so we can explain this there are two different\nScales here two different measuring scale\nAnd so what you need to remember is that each sport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if he got a sixteen and basketball people that are not a very good games you get a sixty nine and baseball people like securing\nYou're sitting ready to go to a store [laughter]\nSo we're talking about different measuring the scales for each part of life not just sports and golf has this really interesting thing where they start with a an agreed upon number so say sixty nine and you go a little bit above her a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and and some experience on that car so so golf is a scale that low to high and some with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of things in life\nAre the skill it's high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or that\nThe police that we are going to compare ourselves against it just to golf new low score and everything else almost you need a high score but that's what you're saying the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come some golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular part to standard usage of par\nWere part of the number that you're going to try to beat and go above them so it's a path justice thank you for your call we really appreciate it thank you but I already have a\nLanguage has its cord but sports oh it's just an extra ... words seemed to go\nThis was actually bought walls\nWell simply [noise]\nJoin us for hearing now tomorrow morning from tend to noon Iran case a double you see any point nine FM and K.

I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right now I used to but now I think which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of pilots depending on the podcast wait you take out your medical playing as quickly it automatically removed the silence and people paused or there's a break between segments or that sort of thing\nOh man I guess it depends on the topic what pod cast your listeners thoughtful\nPodcast become friends can mimic unfortunately so pulled Goodman silence and his book speaking of language facts assignments that I really want\nThose are the moments that I really appreciate how rare they are having to going to say even in a church which we think of as being assignment place there's still some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and\nThe kids in Bible study writing or ... even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real silent\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about the right just letting those thoughts float through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on science is a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three\nEmail words that we were radio dot org hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is a\nWill calling from Lexington, Kentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure we'll get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] ah actually is a bit of a more of a nomenclature question before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand\nSo I was calling it the washing machine for a while a which apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine\nSo I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official moniker a washing machine whereas the dishwasher\nHas this to sit through it and why can't you call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right\nBecause it's it's usually either the washer the washing machine and very rarely do you do in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of this out for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagree I may have had with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call the clothes washing machine or is that not allowed\nOh are you both from Kentucky\nI Know we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here we both move around quite a bit I I had some time in Los Angeles she spent some time in Japan of all places or\nOh let's let's set the second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can\nShe got some time and get an of all places where a Clinton let's set that second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for\nThe kind of a linguistics at first the first thing you've got to understand is that the machine\nThe dish washing machine replaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happen with the word computer we have this divide on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math\nWere also noted computer so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job then get the human name so that's part of the reactors interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher\nThe other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old centuries older than any other kind of\nHow ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes has been in ... in specialized up the word that linguists use\nSpecial like this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo wow All right now because of washing when you say I'm On a Jew the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes but he's really into\nThis thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is that dishwashers weren't part as the everyday\nHousehold right in this country until about fifty right now and that that washing machines were little or will the word torture meaning machine dishwasher due to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in intimate right\nEveryday use of it you know you had industrial dishwashers or rational dishwashers All right so it really works on a kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones that kind of\nTakes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out at the meeting for American football\nAnd in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football but if you'd say football people in their mind they think of the one specific more common kind of ... who are you are form so yeah\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger\n[laughter] I I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that the ...\nWell yeah you can but why\nDid they just to be that there are cuts witness maybe there was no degree I think\nThe one who love the laundry and presses the button to call it whatever they said well you're doing the laundry you call it whenever you want them out she's doing whatever she wants\n[laughter] that thousands of buying a ticket and thanks for your call All right thank you bye\nBye bye good clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Yuma", "day": "25"}
