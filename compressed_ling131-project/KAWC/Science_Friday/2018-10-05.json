[noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but about detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah I was a there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view that blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the store over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see\nThe gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of horses pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so sometimes the planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing\nTo the moon [laughter] hey says no and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and there's the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around a those are all plausible explanation ... uh but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and\nUh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such an incredible claim or it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you're right very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this very sure yeah\nYeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope ah from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh\nThe tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope ah from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple data sets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that I ... a better for you guys were looking at axle plant it's going to be like why yeah if it had been spectacular\nInstrument at the very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as humble orbits the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine humble staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out how a James ... or ... he won't have that problem and like I said the mirror is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly all the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downs officer another issue\nAnd I absolutely did the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law when we shouldn't made it twice as big we've had whatever half sure yeah you\nKnow so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's\nA I I don't know who's working on a bed and it's a ultraviolet and a red and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh they they come up with great uh names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is over I tell you this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nAround for another hour on science friday beginning in twenty minutes ear on K.

Scott experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at ... which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this was front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hams wanted you know create this poisonous quieter get from the bottom of the food safety\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras right he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher\nConductor on the underground railroad during the civil war and he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about a month that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never\nIt's poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ... he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also a night to enter a preacher\nOn the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about a month that\nHe took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party is feeling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are\nThe more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying we'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that\nUh the role of the government [noise]\nHang on travel golf\n[laughter] but it could take a drink of water [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say on the constitution promote the general welfare and this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an Africa as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation\nAt our way we think about food safety so did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws pads then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten the ... but that was the first great consumer protection laws\nEver pass by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you ask why only he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nI'm only frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nHumanities cage WC supported by the ...\nAt the next spirited discussion to learn the story of this remarkable magazine Wednesday November seventh from five thirty to seven at St Paul's cultural center for information visit K.

[noise]\nWell actually so I you don't have to have the cell there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power\nOf biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on your talk is that I have fun forcing molecules to have sex\nWith Oh yes I Do [laughter] well if\nYou think about ... you have to wonder why nature\nBiology the power biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and an end pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on your talk he said I have fun forcing molecules to have sex with Oh yes I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would divide such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nWe combined DNA that encodes something novel\nShe would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ...

of contentious news individual political races Ken we have better conversations\nAbout the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why\nWe're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey ... neighbor\n[noise] hey they're either and go ahead so odd\nDied previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nWomen or being a man who contributes suicide you the systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist systems so I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing at I mean that's um and I identify myself and it's such a way really changed my mind\nKnowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide your systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify ...\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system though I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing reminisced um and I did find myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about that\nThat's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening he's you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the program but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the call has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience [laughter]\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require map it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\n[noise] I agree I think that logic does not require math but logic is in a way parts of math\nAnd these things have poured boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not [laughter]\nLet's talk about some from a current event so it would turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues and tell me what you mean by that\nWell that's a whole other on a whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that just about whether you can be in prison for Thanksgiving things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence buried the paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser and an acute personnel let's just say that you as a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mom I'm the woman both innocence\nThe general principle when in fact that just about whether you can be in prison for things and things so going on from the presumption of innocence there the paradox because some people say well we have to put you pick someone innocent until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser undone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman on the accused Boston is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation\nAnd so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocence at the same time because I could just contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradox his for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting leveled or finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person for the innocent and then we can look up ... will that create for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and go what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by false accusations so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't free to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault all the time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo that ... is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes\nOn so many of our arguments at the moment ton device is because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or watch one that professor along but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the both will crime as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is on straw puffing arguments while you can take that false equivalence\nAnd then you can declare while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man jumped by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very ...\nAnd rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things the ... as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is on straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence\nAnd then you can declare while using everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man jumped by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that the question of knowledge or a ton of hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is meant to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Yuma", "day": "05"}
