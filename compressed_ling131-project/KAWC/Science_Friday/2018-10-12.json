miss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even the mob at a press conference has\nOne of the first two American animal successfully launched into and returned from space missed bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth\nAnalyzing their communications the structures of their societies and the brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says the neatest stone and assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animal that went into space wow what got you fascinated with studying scar\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season\nBut the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter]\nUm but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie so how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do do they each have each personality of the room and you give them names like you keep track of that\nSome ... square one of the challenges of working with school monkeys that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram Mac so that's about two pounds there's fifty of them and they are\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of it some\n... square one of the challenges of working with monkeys or that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram Mac so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time foraging in the morning for insect but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of school monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch things pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd out with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and\nI understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch tennis [noise] right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and\nOnce the adult walks desert then that's the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those wipes for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself\nProblem we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider monkey slept let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls I'm so they're basically\nOf all the other one of the spider monkey swept let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does it ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize Earl\nI'm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver so um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that that's the sound that we hear is that rises there there's usually this is those squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because square monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys\nInstead of bird how hard was it how much time as are taking you to know the difference to study this hour they make so it's\nNot something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about squirrel monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes\nSometimes he does he like it she loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nSecond hour at science friday's starts in twenty minutes at one o'clock here on K.

years in the wild\nWild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then reach ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a compass that's just telling you wearing north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more north east\nEast and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded that what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of the euro their map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their elastic dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lives you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said it but but salmon live in principle lives right they travel all that way how many miles to their journeys tech\n[noise] that is pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nFan and they usually hedging these really tiny streams mild inland and I have to go back there [noise] that is correct and they don't just have to navigate up steam after find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort and\n[noise] you know the sad thing and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys in wages they use something more broad scale and then the term we think they're using magnetic nap and they make information\nNow I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIn\nThe ... the same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know the year researchers looking at a different group of Sam be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nSo these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never sets in outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nOr ... and yet you found that they still have these jewel magnetic maps and the that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these in one\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for a map and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as my dad field intensity\nAnd so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear but it's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strength and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nThough these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the men need a receptor itself a is still elusive\nNow why why it important to your wife and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nIt's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense\nJust to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine also possess disability it's another group of individuals that does that mean\nSelf uh is still elusive\nNow why why it important to your wife and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so\nWe wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine also possess disability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps of diverse amount not amounts of these days\nBut we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nAnd so how did you go about testing reach for though\nThe aid from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you touch copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that it allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nMhm so what you're doing I Know from my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnifies the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nSo we are present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of metal type right that right somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas\nTo give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials so what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos\nAnd we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific guy and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the main interests with those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these two should get\nIn for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale than I Would not those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nStory of this remarkable magazine Wednesday November seventh from five thirty seven at St Paul's cultural center for information visit K.

I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they try to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration database\nI think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand sixteen warmer there there are a couple of things that we are talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure\nBut there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchased a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the role that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against 'em or election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers eat whole books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still are not have confirmed whether or not they're they're certainly wasn't an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you kind of what our used they're often or a tablet or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the smaller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them or that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise [noise] well\nI'm I'm well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped\nUm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um perhaps to influence the elections ranging from [noise]\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems\nUm in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about\n'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states um they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then they're voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several\nStates um or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan on paper ballots and if we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the death con um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um and you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and would it be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing because it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of\nBrute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to ... hour day right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to\nThe my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election\nWhen they're in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing\nThat um there were mistakes made but a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but\nWouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes in the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines are right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks\nThat we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I I could just jump in real quick point um I I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and as an example of that my an obvious example\nReal quick point um I I I\nI I think there to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that might an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nListen for you coming up in twenty minutes at two o'clock here on a double UC eighty eight point nine of them and K.

friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen hundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the eyepiece he see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs that to Kelly the vendors she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you I Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh you were each are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for seven to forty two\nTo break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years as Dr Kelly ... she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much for it to be with you\nOn a certain amount of shot out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one of the half degree increase in global temperature all your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even at one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big change [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference and good for example\nTo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with\nTwo degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me which for coral reefs where the report found that\nOne point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under that to point zero degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible\nOn there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make\nUnder one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under a to point zero degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened\nOn right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even when the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about it on to it would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but not ... need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew you to report won't go there with that can you can you answer that lead to commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that\nOn the scientist basically is that all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together detail technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators calm make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually indoors this report\n[noise] [noise] mhm [noise] ... a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina oh Jana\nYeah fellow so culture and I think what ends up confusing\nPeople when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us in agriculture\nIs the high temperatures for the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced revealed are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this was really critical of the or the ...\nFellow so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in agriculture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced revealed are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this was really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year":
