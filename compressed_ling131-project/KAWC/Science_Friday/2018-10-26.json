I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute an odd way ... when did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you could really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really fun way to have it movie made\n[laughter] except for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of an engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking ... and the numbers sure what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a choice I think we're\nI think that's a real quote of as you you ... you know right I did I did I I met him once I'm\nAt a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way up by ... I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak to engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drugs and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective which he has reserved as you went as you knew him and well I didn't really I don't think I knew him that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask her own office so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit of\nPerhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you know you didn't get that impression too much into moving\nNot so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that record concentration and diligence\nYeah and there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI engineers have a whole variety of personalities so I think he saw a few different personalities in that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer there is a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight where they had the Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and\nStruck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight where they had been Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying a ... a news you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this on floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nThat you were really crammed in there the cockpit is right in your faith the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up till can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nThat is going to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nAndrew are you there\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment [noise] um yeah I was saying it just since you mentioned in the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous mission\nAnd that was just looking up all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success or failure in that sense but a ... a fantastic a moment [laughter] captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very concerning um uh the big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the last so the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know ... Apollo one whatever how do you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out a\nWell I you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been at um air force bases and there's many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flight so\nIn in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to last us like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nSupported by visit him of presenting Rio de surveys Abreu fast October twenty sevens from five to nine at desert sun stadium a limited number of VIP tickets are available that include early injury to VIP area as souvenir mugs an opportunity to meet him sees big dean Baba and more information and tickets available at Rio de surveys the dot\nCom in Yuma sunny today with a high of Ninety four degrees north wind five miles per hour\nTomorrow sunny I near Ninety five Parker will have sunny skies and a high of Ninety three today with north when five to ten miles per hour and tomorrow in Parker sunny with a high near Ninety four degrees\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movie first man\nFrom the personal hardships the astronaut overcame to be jarring dizzying process of astronaut training\nTo have that story led to all the missions and since that time ...

Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration very few women\nAnd he was the first African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool purse to hang out with I mean she's done dancing and acting and was on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and\nUm you know insurance that very inspired by the civil rights movement I just feel like she's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie about and I love to be addressed you see something about\nHer or him you're nodding very much in agreement\nOh yeah I may Jonathan ... is very cool I I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about it you can you tell us a little bit about her street on um I I think pretty much what the college that jazz is what I Know of her as a she just a lot like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different\nThings from science to the arts and leisure [noise]\nAh on age I miss having yeah there's certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for ah women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell their\nUh-huh yep so movie I think that would be amazing stories or um you know or like this amazing than it is a treat from a tweet from episode how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nOr perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for something like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes story right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mercury ... Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe with the ... some kind of Netflix theories about about them also some kind of documentary series that was or regard as\nYeah um [noise] and all the people who were in a control room and all the other places and you know [noise]\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting ah this this is the movie um about the roads have astronaut certainly fifty years ago and still be fifty\nYears since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen\nWe have the right stuff once Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago with so much has happened since what do you think\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible is like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to because of that\nUh and that that like I think that there are plenty of storage to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get their due [laughter]\nYou know that's when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're ... and other places ... we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other Asif there's so many countries\nUp there right now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like uh there's many ways to make her into the story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like\nThe space dog like uh there's many ways to make that are into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back we're also imagining the future is your what are they talking about NASA these days about\nA ... well what are big project is actually trying to get back to the mood so that that the Ryan as the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of uh stories to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nTo the flight ... for the astronaut to fly on it mhm ... and made to Arizona Welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I I Would think it'd be interesting to uh make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop a launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it in the end it effected them in ways that many people did though of course in fact if she'll be crew but oh\nI think that many of the engineers have a story to tell as well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a I'm a that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh\nI'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident Mm [laughter]\nYou know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today that was in the Nineteen sixties\nI mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon and the the mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do um the\nAmount of a prop we name when Neal said he wished for more ...

I'm a shanty why she couldn't afford a commercial than she passed because he'd seen them in the market and she said well it's either a Senator Pat or milk and we need milk and from that I'm wary because he's a bit of an extraordinary fellow um spent twelve is\nComing up with a low cost sanitary pads machine that can be money they'll ... can be afraid to fly all the women and there are now four thousand of them all over 'em pulled over the world\nBut the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided that the best way to do that\nStanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah so he decided that the best way to do that obviously was to wake up his own uterus in the form of um a a a goat plaza filled with a goat blood\nAnd I'm Sorry yeah sorry it was a football field with goats slogans blood and he attached it to his clothing and had a little pump\nAnd went around all day and every so often pumped it and so I tried to simulate the experience of a men's dressing woman\nUm he learned a lot [laughter] so I think a lot of men would if they did that [laughter] um\nAnd also because he lived in South India where it's hot he uh he was wearing white so which is pretty much every woman's nightmare and I'm not a ... century pad advertising has told us over the years and so you know there was stains and leaks in east are a lot of time checking behind themselves like women do a lot and um\nHe eventually came understood what was in such pets and\nHas revolutionized synch pets in India quite an amazing fellow\nNews amazing it's a good you know more men should try that a company out the trials and tribulations\nOf what women go ask him with football [laughter] I I think there's so many great little um moments in your book on a little statistics that just jumps out let me go through a few of them you have a staff that every three seconds someone received a blood transfusion\nWow you know the joke behind that is they ought to find that guy and stop him where [laughter] but\nIt's such a ... in the states is that she every two seconds is that right yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of the biggest and idle idle makes sense\nI how how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell what I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the mask donation and I'm supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old\nAnd in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they they ... they started in pretty similar fashion that people who are selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did\nAnd it was even a union of blood cell is in New York and other people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling that blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties uh adult to in Chicago called ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit best friend he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do um was to treat blowout as a commodity really so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you use blood you should supplied lots of so he sets up a blood bank\nAnd I know in Chile that transformed I'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the U. S. um the notion of paying full blood um died out and it's now a whole donated not illegal to sell you a blood\nIn the U.S but it's just nice to frowned upon not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college you know lots of college students who were selling their blood for for money just you know for to have some spending cash\nCan still do that but you you what you're doing is selling blood plasma I'm so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of\nLiquid in your blood and um yeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and\nCan do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and the sixty dollars a pop selling a plasma us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd now you write that the U.S is seen as the old pack of plasma [laughter] like where do the cartel of plasma\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow picking the breath through your nose short cut deep into your brain ... notice anything different than maybe how the room smell [noise]\nRecent study suggests that breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory\nAnd that's a note to view mouth breeders out their hair to untangle how olfaction is linked to deeper parts of the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on the professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors aren't welcome to science friday Hi\nThank you I'm happy to be here we're happy\nTo have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several key aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing\nThat smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our external world\nAnd the way that this information get from these neurons inside of our noses into the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems\nInformation relates through a structure called the ... before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose\nInto the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives a little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provide the sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\nSo just the act of breathing through your nose to nose also since the air is coming in and alerts these this pathway in the end point in your brain to save something interesting happened\nIt yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are the kennel receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythm just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the\nDriven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or why I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special Tibet sensory Oregon\nUh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that the study is sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger [noise]\nUm but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth or do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as as tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's that's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouths\nUm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word\nUm and it definitely impacts flavors and and tasty us us to talk about\nYour study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's a very interesting point um we did not use fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located\nVery very deep almost in the center of the brain and making them very hard to reach noninvasive Lee so we can't record from these areas from electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory Olympics structures\n[laughter] if it falls factoring in memory are related to you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell\nA right that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory\nDecline um and well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms navy altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that\nBe altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing it's so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we are looking into and in the lab to do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nMove so that's something you know you're going to be following up right yes on ... any neurodegenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two states just by analyzing the shapes of their breeding waveform\nOr are we the only I'm going to just throw this high because I'm really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals a breeze through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really ... watch this and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Erin and still live in one that was laid off and on one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is it's typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "26"}
