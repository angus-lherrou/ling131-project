C. dot org this has been made possible in part by a grant from Arizona humanities\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the specific guards plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd can individual behavior still took the hand of faith for the whole group or the hives indeed the legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and no pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat my did my PHD in a honeybee lab and but I went Robie and worked on ... and that's a third of a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees until I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only these bumblebees have a very different like psycho right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in a life as a hobby queen\nOr she's living on around the bumblebees are different and they have an annual eat social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerging economy and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring IDs clean to have to crawl out of there over wintering thought and start their own that said they spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and\nSo they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary and sex are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought him to show us with ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go than it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that anthrax or with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\n... in the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees at the same and swings my lab actually studies ends um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forging how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... home\nYour broker maps with you and John Jarvis harvester from I'm here in California looks like stuff I see on the sidewalk since ... even larger than what you are a little bit longer\nThere but yeah and they don't score sheet and then once you can see on the sidewalk\nAnd well why are you interested in the\n... and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they called her friends to the food sales and everything I brought here as in the cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head oh so\nIt looks like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes you is there like pouring plaster Paris it's exactly faster players from Home Depot\nHow far does that goes around and just the whole life and now that says the top part about six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when Kass as his ink um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and food flows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it's much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said that the drone don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because\nThey have this part of their life or they're living on their own and we've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or were those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during the larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nNo I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your input start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets style\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um\nThat's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were done by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer and it's also live in big groups where the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas bees will and put their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will also there is a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places so there's some tomatoes and some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have ... counties that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... can be up to a million individuals\nAnd just been trying for Halloween I Know that you also started social spider borders social spider\nBeers on the western college

science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said too strict about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole she'll bang but he's our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back tickets\nLast week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n[noise] it ain't\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes for\nUm the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble\nYeah 'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to end in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star will be considered a short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do\nThose tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects of you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes and I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it will abound sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours the quality what what is one of the genes doing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I Would like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works\nI'm from a kind of a lot of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nUm be a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you refer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep and improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on now what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep\nAre not in our brains they're not in our heads they're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain that are expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study beam all one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have\nIn the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed and the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso bi Moe one is what's known as a clot seen\nYour clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't know what collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time I had the output mechanism that allows you to tell the time\nThe majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulate sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we look primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow to sleep and more importantly\nHow to recover from sleep loss and what do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that are the hit on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it sets to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking to the circadian clock that regulates your daily\nRhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down at night um synchronized has a clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock would still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here yeah\nI had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you are speaking out in the south\nSo napping isn't as a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they ... years now and that all I Do have one or the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon and no one can complain they can write it all I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is laughing is very important if you're not getting daily suspiciously and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not than getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually what's about recommended but anything from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that they're ...\nAnd you're still napping that goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much so that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine\nIf the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons sometimes between one of the three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't\nBlame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me back to where it let me go to the questions on that side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day because yes\nAbout two weeks or even nine zero San jose ...\nIf you'd like more information you can reach us a nine to wait three fourths of and six nine zero of service of Arizona western college for more than forty five years this was a double UC Yuma K.

family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... rolled back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damages for these companies because the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what other industries have also tried to get a has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's\nBeen ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem they've had researchers who helped author the eye PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuel years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nTo voters across all the taxes and flip the state they're challenging so are the people we don't like let me know so are the people don't like lesbian so are the people who don't like strong woman\nAt the time on the U.S\nListen for Latino USA tonight from seven to eight here on a WC eighty eight point nine of them and ... a WC dot org it's one

the dot\nCom that's science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of seats actions happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet look at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd wanting to vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\n... for for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that land to Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us the land to series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and\nC section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um started socio cultural acceptance that surgery as a normative on thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first it's area and so it's it's it's it's complicated\nWe've seen the rise I'm In a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean\nFor example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver last talking about over by us there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital and getting the sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there [noise]\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's an accepted norm is part of the culture and in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and it's not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI don't want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and watch the sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology\nAnd why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be vice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C section strike the due to do you have to approach this do you ever ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the right in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and [noise]\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who makes a recommendation for instance area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\n'em the progress during labor in terms of the cervical dial Asian I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy [noise]\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only Brent delivery unit that might put some pressure on to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that um patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to the [noise]\nAll I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time that they're having a ... birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nUh her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome ...\nI actually had an emergency thirty why do we um [noise] and I think for that for that but when I got pregnant for at that time I really wasn't given the option of Elbert after\nThat I had to do all of that\nUm is it I said on my though I I look at what they I I look at what were the very end mighty you'd get pregnant and um it really was it was like my provider\nMurray and maybe you've written in the ... and um it really was it was like ... or\n... you want to have the time I was like oh I like that but I wasn't getting their risk and then it it it will make it truly is that um and so I think that um I was able to\nInformation you can contact us at night to wait three and four seven six nine zero\nAnd Parker sunny in a high of eighty seven today north when five to ten miles per hour tonight mostly clear lows

[noise] this\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of seats\nAnd this\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of seats sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony go and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and a lot a lot of folks on on the line and let's see we only going to take it to everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research mid were free in the u._k. how does the approach the er compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says area and and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was associated with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of birds are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nUh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows them they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nTony going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and try to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary there in a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd then the last obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people you see a heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing\nDo you test nonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate trade sings using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definition for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definition for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiastic and for the dark and then also some other operations issues for a unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor ... for do if you were only from so phone down here in Boston and so there's this old me now to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on says there and delivery rates is that\nIf you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another who take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter the thrill of it to this and services I have to wonder how much would you encourage her to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\n[noise] will ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or were wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field in in ... in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one and in time or is perceived to be in time [noise]\nYou're you're ... the main issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U.S a dummy embarrassment is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay\nYou know it's good to ... in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were at mandated by the doctor due to complications throw chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nAnd um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section due to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like what are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nAs questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slide I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... bird census area and are fully fully discussing Tony what about this ... who's charge of sexism\nTheir point well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gets birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happened um it's no less are no more regardless of what the motives delivery is and sit there and delivery on certainly makes you just as much as a mother on as having a bad time for a", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "19"}
