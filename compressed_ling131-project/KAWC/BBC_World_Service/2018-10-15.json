among equals in the old folks should say has a very a significant position and not sense now Moscow is saying that they will no longer a maintain its relationship with constant typos that basically stumble\nUm and that is all because of a crisis in Ukraine now what's happened in Ukraine is that ah the spiritual leader the ... the patriarch of some ... has essentially allowed Ukrainian church to a declare independence from Moscow not something which uh Ukraine\nOut of the church in Ukraine has been a little campaigning for for many many years but not specifically picked up the ticket out after\nA twenty four team with of course the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the political crisis and indeed the conflict between Russia\nAnd Ukraine that's been a raging now for some for years so
