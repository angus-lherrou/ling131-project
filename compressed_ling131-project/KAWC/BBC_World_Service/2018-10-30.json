your tea an elastic cloud computing more and more at sea three dollars a art and from\nSomeone else who seems dissuaded ... is President Trump he's routinely claimed that millions of people voted illegally when he was elected two years ago\nHe was never offered any evidence for that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes cost to vote to registration forms\nThere's no actual or real verification done by election officials once they get that for him to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nExample of the problems is there's a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nNon citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check that's a problem and is the problem that in many states you're not show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nGive them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they tell you that you are staring up specter for problem where there isn't really a problem how you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand a what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election\nI don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory it's tens of millions of votes it would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and us probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level\nFraud to change that and that's probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\n... taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of voted suppression and what your political opponents say it's the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate passing the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on races to believe that for example African Americans\nDon't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose cute it's a problem that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to depress turn out\nThe number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready booming is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight for voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud\nI think it's a very small problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there\nThere might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and has made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nThat if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out surely you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solution to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution\nA lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast that there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that\nHave voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there is actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or be swayed from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been attracted to the ballot box evidence you have that they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at\nThe dynamics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the end and a Republican claimed as many different Asian or that these laws have helped\nThem whether it be that it out and carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to lose I asked ...\nIf you look at the case the frog that weren't covered most of the time they weren't ex felons\nWho didn't realize they're an eligible to vote there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they talk about it because there's a very very steep price to pay when you're talking about potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines\nAll for

Eighteen sixty six after\nThe U.S civil war and the very first part of that amendment says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of

U.S government or the immigration services ... to process or children born here on us soil or if it's just a in regards to ... the children and on undocumented migrants would not process their citizenship papers would not treat them as citizens\nAre and they would be subject to the same rules that are applying to these undocumented migrants another language and that constitutional amendment it was really a gift to frame or is intended it to be to apply to say foreign diplomats and American Indians who are not considered full citizens they were sovereign members of their own nation\nUm but the but there was a Supreme Court decision towards the end of last century\nAnd also learn more about it here because there's a report that is that you might have seen is as from the WWF or conservation group protect nature um and many people have been talking about some of the figures\nAnd that they have been pushing out they are talking about how mass\nConsumption human consumption exploding human consumption is the way they put us\nHas led to massive wildlife lost that particularly talk about first break species mammals fish birds and the peons reptiles\nI'm an doc up close species there was an average of sixty percent lost between Nineteen Seventy two thousand and fourteen [noise] um [noise] we have a guest who work with\nAn endangered species very different\nDr Esteban ... is South American regional director for ... para global wildcat conservation organization and particular working to conserve Jagger is around the world here in the u._k. with you work at an ecologist spokesperson for the British hedgehog preservation decides he\nAh so quite different Esteban is joining us from ... in Columbia high Esteban\nHow you doing a very good to have you with us also wants you to meet you um are you somewhere along the I'm twenty five which is a massive Moshe way a cutter ringing London\nSmoke quite a ... you know how the rest of us to meet you where are you that you know just outside very close to my house you don't but not a long journey back on you were very\nGlad to have you and I find that figure is a little bit confusing when I was reading them the sixty percent I think I find it easier to think about um the human consumption that has changed the amount of animals and various species here on the plan is Esteban what did you think when you look to the report\nAnd we've seen it coming I think it's no surprise and specially when your like needle work with a large carnivores\nAnd we've seen it coming I think it's no surprise and especially when you're like me to work with a large carnivores these are the first animals go extinct though extinction has an order\nA large animals that require large rages on my phone number is that means they depend on the other prayed to live that basically also threatened or the first to go\nTo is the issue for jak you it\n[noise] they should which are worse than from that same point they're large on their ... so they need huge areas or rain forest or welcome serves the vine up to survive so that is of course contested by extensive agriculture and Human Services in general [noise]\nSo what what area is is that typically I Know you're speaking to me from Colombia but you look at South America [noise]\nWell the the stronghold for John whereas in South America is the Amazon the Amazon basis for jaguars exist have existed in all the well conservative school systems load two thousand meters above sea level\nIs from Mexico to Argentina and we call got the job or the or doors on our aim in Congress to try and from served that kind of the at least the representation of that kind of activity a rage wide\nAnd do you know what the figures are when it comes to how it's changed let's say over the past [noise] forty fifty years\nYeah yeah absolutely we've we've lost at least half of the population you know war is between fifty five percent of loss in terms of its habitat and its population so they're going down every day\nYou you're looking at hedgehogs instead I'm\nMissing anymore I used to see them when I was a kid but what are the numbers when it comes to how they're doing\nA fascinating the figures on that is similar to what's happening with Jackie\nI'm an ... if you look at the job and you think it's such a small benign all animal it's a very suburban Atlanta but on the ... to me I I Do hundreds told around the country and\nEvery single talk I go to people saying butting heads of state is the same thing we know who's the head of the country is down by a just in the last six senior population down by the\nEnd of an areas down by over I saw in rural areas possible that the hedge population of the United kingdom has jumped by around Ninety five percent of the end of the second World War ... declined but it's interesting from from what I found a thing\nThat joke is it called the ... mountain needs surprisingly\nLarge amounts of faith to be able to move around it needs to be able to ... to move between\nI won't do anything with the head choked street campaign in the United kingdom have the same thing we're trying to keep these cars all day while we're looking at an income we're looking at connecting people's gone on the full scale exactly the same for them\nSo why why did they what needs to happen for the hedge has there were all kind of safe passage for them in certain places explaining to understand around the world to you that might even I don't know everything had choke\nOkay go ahead Charles ... is a small ... can lay up to around one point to kilogram\nThey don't have a fight or flight response if they are\nJust a stable Rose Bowl so they're very easy to get close to land in the United kingdom every single time there was a ... about how ... ... favorite animal hates the head choking single time everybody that people not pet talks in this country\nAnd the positive ... federal aid from the point you've just made did you used to see them in your ... you used to see them regularly but we don't do that any more difficult the population declined\nThat's from the point you've just made it used to see them and you'll see used to see them regularly but we don't do that any more to be called the populations declined dramatically noticing now the head shop but I'm\nWondering you said the love is there but I haven't been enough to help with their survival I'm curious Esteban is there a love for Jagger is there because I Would imagine that love translates into action\n[noise] yeah well actually with the jaguars it's also an iconic species but it's had a journey along the ages in the minds of humans\nSo it used to be in the summer Indians and ... those people used to be a semi guard on the president and all the legends on history all both tribes and respect and then when the call of the undeveloped land use schools in the past\n... cows on ... avenue pig but now there's an age where we are recognizing after a while but I Do not represent their will\nWhile they're at the top America\nOn of course we all work and a lot of people that are\nAnd valuing it from their arm chairs is changing\nAnd just briefly from us about what would it mean\nIf the jaguar became extinct [noise]\nAlways thought it would be a doctor because it is one of the way groups plays a key role in the maintenance of vehicle system so if we take out the John Edwards from the equation will get a lot of past like ...\nLike it up or also was increasing them their core flew over trying to change the old eco system depending on what they eat\nIt will label trickling down to shadow onto amounts of water and clean water we have the rivers\nWow I'm I Want to turn over the hedgehog back in the u._k. you it's a hedgehog we've gone\nFrom me being up they tend to think about the hedge hoping\nTo make one that we can actually form a relationship with unlike your time with any other pull my love life I think that we are talking about a two very different species in this country because of the population declining dramatic rate all how big of\nA pain in countries like kingdom we looked to choose which have got elephants we treat ... tigers and we got what you should be considered you know things you should be facing the we call them\nOut by calling the small and the nine months to live with that I Do I think it's going to be told we begin to\nFocus last potential just because it's a way of also with nature it's a way that she forming relationships way far above and beyond the God and you come in and you see this you can get those notes on the head choking when you get snow to the hedgehog\nYou on those those with an animal what you think of the Ninety nine percent of all animals that have ever lived on the planet in the top one percent with the blue ... on a Tuesday magnificent the new one was in school just practice at rice up that with the jak you are in terms of like Tony\nMinds we can get hooked up with that they're having on those that no you\nHave made the patch I think for the hedgehog and also I think for the jaguar when a tank Q. I also want to thank Esteban just fascinating I mean those than just put it in context so well why don't you tell us what animals you\nAre thinking about in this story plus four four seven seven three zero seven five Nineteen twenty five is our number is up to hear from you [noise]\nIt's not for four seven seven three zero seven five Nineteen twenty five is our number is up to hear from you [noise]\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service some of us was made possible by the American public media with support from sea of pre certified financial planner professionals trained in providing holistic financial planning and the client's best interest was make a plan dot org\nOr it could be stopped or a number of ways but sending troops to our border particularly military active military troops to engage an armed families who are escaping desperate situation is absolutely the wrong approach [noise]\nBut so the two hundred billion dollars that the usa sense to these countries to help with um where does that money going [noise]\nAnd where is it because I've been doing anything [noise]\nWhat was that we have\nWe have provided aid but it's the corruption that exists in the end the governments\nNow are there because you are a desperate to that in another country does not give you an asylum protection usa but it's not part of the asylum ...\nCountry does not give you an asylum protection in the usa but it's not part of the asylum criteria\nI Wonder do ... and James though if people make their way as far as the border and we think it will take weeks actually them in terms of the long gone and finished I think by the time they mice reach but you know would you trust and orders and I said they're called the immigration agents border agents\nTo take those people on a case by case basis of whether they have um you know appropriate is a need for asylum because each person would need to apply individually [noise]\nIt it has been done we've been doing it because we do have every day we have illegal aliens crossing the border and so they are treated humanely and going back to Senator Obama then Senator Obama\nHe was saying the same thing that President Trump is saying now the problem is that it becomes a Democrat Republican issue not not a lawful\nUm issues Senator Obama they're they're I mean here it from the horse's mouth he when he was senator he was promoting that the sovereignty of the United states of America is important and that we should protect it\nI mean at holiday and I I Will say doors with every president there has been there has been more deportations I think historically that's the way it's gone what they're Democrats or republic just each\nAt president that has taken office I'm more people have been deported from the United states who understand what you're saying in some of those respects but Julio we're hearing James in North a totally different take\nOn what's happening when it comes to immigration is this something that you are hearing in El Paso Texas is not an echo of conversations\nUm when it comes to the surge of immigration yes we have\nA we we have immigration shelters right now that are at capacity or the\nThey're basically opening up new shelters in different a church building a ... a pretty much a students' eyes releases more people to them I didn't want to offer at one point of clarification however uh there there's a term that he's being used or when it comes to sue the care of and then but people seeking asylum being\n... illegal immigrants and I do want to clarify the asylum regardless of whether it's requested at the port of entry for in the middle of the desert is one hundred percent legal process so they are not illegal immigrants because they are requesting this legal tiles of asylum at the beginning\nThey have not requested that yet they have not reached the border one state step on American soil they become illegal I Will also say oh well we are anticipating we are anticipating that\nThe seven five whatever the number is ah that they will be stopped at the border and some will step on American soil and they become illegal at that point\nLet me move to another topic that has come out today and actually is all ties in reading because a President Trump has been speaking to a website called Axios political websites on has talked about potentially using an executive order to\nEnd birthright citizenship which would mean that babies that are born to um people that are legally in the country or non documented migrants would not automatically have American citizenship James did you see that's what you eat\nTree or non documented migrants would not automatically have American citizenship James did you see that's what you think\nThere are absolutely up you know\nThe there is a a sort of obscure constitutional debates on that point but I think we all we need to sometimes just apply common sense\nFor approximately a hundred and fifty years the assumptions the acceptance in our society is that someone blown within the soil on the soil of of the United states of America is automatically a citizen\nHas never done any harm it is what we have always done it for the president proposed otherwise though it's simply\nA bigoted attack on immigrants and brown people and it's designed again to sort of stir up the base and and then and secure more votes for this election cycle and it has nothing to do with the reality in which we all survived today\nTo lower its do you agree with James on this point\nNo of course not\nBecause I'm the if you read the whole tax of the [noise] the fourteenth amendment\nThere is a there is language that says\n\nA child born to a legal legal\nIn the United states a non\nCitizen\nPerson in the United states is an American citizen\nIn the United states as well as far as\nThe legality up whether they're here legally at that time the child is born I think\nThe wording is slightly different James how did you understand this year\nThe fourteenth amendment does the rink reference at all to the status of the parents in any way shape or form or is this the end again it's like are are we to assume that for ... years the entire country has sort of got it wrong too you know and we\nCan change that I can actually read the language should make it clear um\nSome of the fourteenth amendment of the U.S constitution adoption they seem to take the text provides that all persons born or naturalized in the U. S.\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there often doctors the tricky fish doesn't say that but that's what I'm telling you are citizens off the United states and off the stage where they reside so the debates would be me would be about ... what does it mean on subject to the jurisdiction there all the bus\nDeclared regular ... addict as it got kind of clue that the discussion included that if the parents were\nHere ... non\nHere in the United states having a child in the United states\nLegally if they were here legally the child with the un American to lead\nThe replay bad at all but again that time they want and then I went and saw it I understand what the discussion is and I can see your area very clearly how polarizing ... comments will be also coming just a few days before the midterms ... just before I let Julio go\nIt doesn't look any different than al Paso Texas these days\nIt it really doesn't um people who have lived in the past with their whole lives like I have a we're used to seeing border patrol agent and but on the border itself and you know just driving around the city as they go to and from the office\nUh with uh the deployment of National Guard troops and what do you expect that deployment of these of five thousand of soldiers or I really don't expect anything when it comes to day to day life just to see or feel different in El Paso or see that's what\nReally don't expect anything when it comes to day to day life just to see or feel a difference in El Paso or see that's what [noise]\nThank you all for speaking to is really a set up shop is also James Garcia ...
