elite in August for an indefinite training period wants to be football star I miss him can is maybe the journalist Indian South Wales and I spoke to her ... maybe they view and today I asked her how did this game go\nIt was his first opportunity to stop us and this time he started as a strong ... spiky replying on the wing and obviously the odds of the world will on him and he was a little bit anxious on that occasion\nTo not to enlist in Sydney he's certainly looked a little bit more comfortable in terms of thing out in the middle but it certainly didn't have it old he's on why I think it's fair to say that most pundits look particularly at that the top and we're probably scratching their heads in terms of just what ability has as a football\nBut he did score twice what does that mean\nI think it means that the jury is very much still out on this experiment than it is indeed an experiment you signed both himself in the lead up to the match\nSaid that this would make or break that if he got to stop it was a show of fights by the management that he had would donate fitness and was able to stop the game\nAnd he felt that he had to deliver now in the top I mean some described it as a die of performance art probably wouldn't go quite that far but certainly\nThe finish wasn't they that instinct that you say with a kid growing up with a football at you know and they go from the idea of trail for just naturally now his way to say and how to move on a football pitch you said both doesn't have that and so I think many are questioning whether at the age of thirty two he can learn that\nBut certainly in the second half as you say\nMore dynamic he's finished on his first goal and the fifty feet made it was a very good go that the taping was absolutely appalling but you can't take away from the fact that you signed boat for a strike\nOn and it struck his job is to put the ball in the back of the net and that's what he beat so certainly you get to take for that performance the second go you and I could have called blindfolded about my age [laughter]\nOh no you would have with with wild lake behind [laughter] there was no one in front of all I mean it was it that are putting it why\nYou talked about fitness levels did they seem to be there this time\nHe was struggling just you know ten minutes into the match\nShe's certainly still is struggling with that spade insurance and different style of athleticism that's required and the the movement required to apply football and you must remember this was he was playing for an island time which is the talk sloshing it's dry but playing against the sick and divisions side\nAnd it's the all states and so\nHe wasn't tying against taught fought a position he was playing and we're surrounded on this occasion bought some of the based mariners pliers started he'd have quality bold thing to leave it to him\nBut he certainly struggled with the finishes waste that instinct Steve ply and finding spicy certainly struggled to spot he stayed he doesn't quite yet know how to use it and I think it's fair to say at times he eats somewhat low clock or\nA baby giraffes sort of old lakes he does look like that on a
