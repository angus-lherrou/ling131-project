headman province now before that he was not very popular in his ... province he was known to be switching side\nPursuing he's on interest but then came a time when the Taliban are inside of the ... the provincial capital of Helmand Province ... and uh they were fair that they were going to take over\nAnd then he comes in at that time and he literally saved to the place he created this militia

[noise]\nYou're listening to us on the BBC will said it's not an ... editorial meeting the ring was gripped by my colleague from the tech you said as\nHe told us what they've been hearing from the tech his media about that the parents Trombone Shorty the gym and this was last seen of course entering the consulate in Istanbul and just say for two weeks ago we've been checking in with ... from the the ... all of this week and she told me a little bit ... for an update\nThe latest safe again then there is a team searching the conflict residents now this was meant to\nTake place yesterday but em later in the day I'm the because the family of to cancel it was still into buildings so to Saudi authorities did not allowed to team to get in\nSo they're after new evidence is reachable substantiate the turkeys official line which is um [noise] say they said that the that Mr ... she was killed and tortured\nIn the consulate as soon as he stepped in to the building so we have more gruesome details on the Turkish media animals into foreign um international media New York times on the Washington Post\nSuggesting that um will again this my disturb people even hearing that his buddy was dismembered\nThat he was kept kept potato so those details and that there were a blood every fire so and again and those aren't the claim that BBC cannot verify at this point because there's no official statement but those aren't the leaks from um named Turkish sources\nAnd the other day when the consulate was searched president Adam said that some of the rules have been painted over\nBut then to search team has used some toxic materials to support the blowouts sane\nSo and also due to some sample soil samples from the garden [noise] um yeah those are all a pretty gruesome men horrendous details that takes an old so I think um it is very interesting that those deals are sharing with the public\nBecause only easily um there were because official line as we are yet to hear but it is alleged that\nMr ... was killed in a ... an interaction and ... and um when something went wrong or this is do the Saudis claim to the international media again\nAnd they blame 'em the Saudis blame the rogue elements within the state and this argument is also what the President Trump also agrees with parents\nWho we know that President Trump sang it at the beginning of the program really to this report saying that President Trump is saying he doesn't want to walk away from Saudi Arabia despite these ongoing concerns about what happened to ... to show Jay [noise] um [noise]\nWhat implications does ... for the relationship between ... and the U.S thirty mines\nAnd they blame 'em the Saudis blame the rogue elements within the state and this argument is also what

the U.S that reminds us actually say Mike Pompeo is in it and I both today having meetings yes\nHe mentioned presidents are done he met the foreign minister spy chief\nAnd um you know top level meetings so and I think it's worth ... remember that it was the day after he visited ... uh the Saudi king and print it saw a month\nSo apparently there was this traffic of diplomacy to ensure that this conflict is rather has rather a global significance and is not only a bilateral conflict with the Saudis\nAnd the Turks I think in this stage turkey has per se you a very clever strategic by bringing ... over international media has been an actor in this conflict because older leagues for me to the international media\nIn terms of the relations turkey wants to have its leverage first overdue Middle East region they still going to have influence and also older the relations between Saudi then turns out to be trained for some time because those turkeys\nUm support or to the Muslim Brotherhood which is funding Saudi Arabia\nAnd it is clear that it was a ... not to lose the Saudis bringing us on board and meanwhile I'm referring to judiciary to a security and avoiding a ... to make this conflict politicized conflict\nSo I think even the statements coming from the Turks um even the United states with Trump saying yeah but the king and the print have denied any knowledge of what happened all those words had been meticulously chosen to avoid I'd rather be conflict [noise]\nAnd I was ... from a BBC tech you're speaking to be a little bit and they were on the line page

stay initially for a long time there was a lot of things to do back home and they thought that would be able to tell them\nThat's why a lot of us went into politics quite late\nBut eventually or in my
