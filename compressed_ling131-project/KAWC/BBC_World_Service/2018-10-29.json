I'm trying to remember where I met a but it was just last week I was reading some articles and it was really talking back to New Jersey in what they had achieved and how it has become a beacon an icon for other countries are very time to read this today but thank you very much for joining us as I mentioned we're very glad you and your team I safe\nMatthew ... so I feed on journal is currently working with BBC Arabic documentary [noise]\nTwenty minutes ... are you with us from the b._b._c. um we want to turn to Pittsburgh down and no doubt\nTwenty minutes ... are you with us from the b._b._c. um we want to turn to Pittsburgh down and no doubt you have seen details of the synagogue attack\nAs survivors have been telling their stories of\nHow they headed storage rooms to avoid the attacker and ah when the suspect was detained after a shootout he reportedly told the officers he wanted old Jews to die\nAt the eleven victims there were named on Sunday into the husband and wife a woman age Ninety seven\nAnd the ATF ... they're Jewish non governmental organization that are based in the states they do this year early study into anti Semitic incidents in the country and into hasn't in Seventeen they recorded on this Tuesday has an anti Semitic incidents that was fifty seven percent more than the previous year\nAnd for the first time since two thousand and ten\nAnd incident occurred in every us states to say to the highest number of incidents where New York California and New Jersey Massachusetts Florida and Pennsylvanians Evan and now even both live in Pittsburgh are both Jewish you both very welcome to the program Hi Evan I never\nSaw this on Neil nice to have you both with us um well I haven't perhaps I could start with you I tell me tell me a little bit about yourself\nUm my name's I don't know I Lived my whole life here in Pittsburgh\nUm I don't want to go too much into detail Sharon fortunately identifying myself more specifically could carry consequences for me and my family at this point\nUm [noise] but uh you know Pittsburgh in general as having lived there for a long time um is a very peaceful community that has a great\nJewish community and it's always been\nYou know accepted and\nIt's always been part of it um I Can't speak highly enough about the city\nSo I haven't I mean let's chat about that for a moment though you don't feel comfortable giving more if your identity and we're totally going to respect that but I just want to hear a little bit more from you on why you feel that's necessary or why you feel perhaps it could be a trash\nI have a family uh that's also Jewish uh my daughter goes to school\nIn the affected area um and I would hate to call attention to that area and make it'd be a target for even\nSomebody whose idea of a joke at this point um I think caution was warranted\nUm and unfortunately I think the idea somewhere out there in somebody's head to the to do something else um well visibility is here because that seems to be the pattern lately with these incidents in the United states\nVery sad now that you're listening to Evan there can you identify with what he's saying [noise]\nNot quite not everything I thought ... years and I'm teaching at that turn on synagogue um I Believe we should stand out and be stronger we shouldn't be in hiding\nAnd I'm very proud to be who I Am I Am part of a Holocaust survivor my dad went to the Holocaust and [noise]\nI think we should stay strong and be together\nYes and I think there is you see there you know I was seeing the rabbi off the tree of life synagogue where this happened calling for a politician to stop using words of Hays I mean do you think the environment has changed over the past few years I understand you grew up in Israel now the book came to the states\nAs you fell in love with an American [noise]\n[laughter] I did move to ... thousand and four and\nNever had a problem in Pittsburgh not ...\nI did move to people Gary ... thousand and four and\nNever had a problem in Pittsburgh not one I Am part time lift driver\nWe have a kind of a ride hailing service shall we say yeah\nI'm I'm Jewish I'm\nI'm a teacher can scan on me turned sixty four centimeters and never won and fear all worried\nAbout anything in the city so has this incident changed anything for you\nKnow now it's that one bad apple fits bogus a beautiful place to be\nSo Avon and might be like to speak specifically to now though because she has one take but I think I'm feeling from you that you have real concerns\nAre real concerns but that's not what the city of Pittsburgh and clear on yes um so I agree with everything she said about the city the city is wonderful and all you have to do is look to the mayor of the city right now and what he's doing and even looking at the other community organizations within the city for example the Muslim community raised\nOver Seventy thousand dollars to support 'em the victims of what happened on Saturday So\nIt's not a knock on the city it's more or\nOf you know you don't want to call attention to yourself right now just because there are people out there in our community that look to do harm to you on social media or other places those aren't necessarily residents of Pittsburgh\nI also um agree with the comments that that was alone actor but unfortunately this is not the first time an incident like that has occurred in the greater Pittsburgh area\nThere was a similar incident and the year two thousand in April where a lone gunman similar situation um\nYou know murdered five people and they use those crimes were based in anti Semitic feeling [noise]\nAnd and I suppose that's what I'm getting at and I just have a another Minnesota I'm Evan Bush whether you think the atmosphere in the states has changed when it come out yet it has been being Jewish you feel it's different\nIt's not specifically because I'm Joyce ... just the attitude towards anybody that's different is no longer an attitude a except during Senate shifting away from that now and again\nI sorry go ahead no just ... go ahead\nAnd I agree we should definitely pride disrespect and acceptance when you forget to do it and we don't teach our kids and that's the outcome of that\nSo you feel there is an individual she gosh has permeated the society\nIt's really interesting bus I'm just as we go and then you feel the city has come together over this year getting so Saleh ...\nAbsolutely I have no doubt the city will respond to the right way\nTo thank all of the communities and pitch slogan the Iraq Iran war for the support love and care that we're receiving it's really touching and hot for me\nBut we loved having you on thank you both we wish you all the best stuff is Evan
