be this question they say okay you were young impressionable [noise] you know easily ... but you should take some responsibility for what happened\nI've taken that responsibly I've already spoke up at the world I've I've done that time I'm not blaming nobody else but Robin myself for what we did this made that clear but how many times do I have to do to\nLet's look if you don't mind that the consequence of Frank's announcement you didn't lose your record deal you're Grammy was retired and and and that was the first time in Grammy history where\nIt was called ... what are your friends family the people ... holiday reacting did you lose a lot of your friends at that point\nAh we lived a very secluded life you know some of my family was not really in touch with my family had the time and a hanger ons we're leaving step by step because we had a an entourage of people who come around just because your famous because you're paying for dinner\nYou fly them places and those people left pretty quick ... so that's another reality that came into play\nNow they will consequences they were on the consequences passed along the way in which you an rope had reacted let's focus on rubs reaction because this change with seismic wasn't that it had an impact on his life are you able to tell us a little bit about that [noise]\nWell you know or you know we we went from uh being celebrated to being joked about it has to have an impact definitely one hundred percent\nJust a matter how'd you how you take it and fortunately Rob didn't see a life after moving nearly I saw her life after moving early you know within dissipated that didn't move and we train would stop\nFor a it came as a surprise and um unfortunately he\nWent into a destructive mode and decided to do more drugs in order to forget what was happening to us at the moment\nAnd then one day five you receive the devastating news about drug where were you at that moment when you received this news what was it like\nI was in Los Angeles I was in my living room and I was watching TV and a manager Kamala\nReceived a call and it was devastating and it was like having a out of body experience I assume they

believe what I was listening to what I was just told rather did\nI was always afraid now worried at this moment would come because the way he was treating himself was not good to himself [noise]\nHe was trying to escape the pain because it was painful to lose it all\nIf you had to turn back the clock now if you had the power to change the way you on life play down would you change anything\nIf I could go back in time and\nRecord those songs everything would be different that's the one thing it would change and and all these like which fix robs death and have Rob stay alive by removing that day out of time I would have those are two things I Would change\nWhat are you doing these days ... what are you doing with your life now\nFact in the matter is a fat more than I speak to the person that's in\nThe human being you know never stop believing that music in his life and music is the cure and music is saved me the reason why I'm here today because uh I never stopped making music I decided about seven years ago to move back to Europe\nAnd I got him to death music scene that are worth ... producers in the meantime I met John Davis one of the original vocally some of the daily and together we've been doing shows throughout Europe performing the classics did you\nMeet the original vocalist before everything was revealed\nDo I make one one of them bread how and ... because Frank made sure to two separate everybody that's what happened so it was pretty much the only person I had met and then John Davis I met like about forty years ago\nJust tell me what that relationship like between John ...\nWhen my relationship ... awesome you know because he he's a musician and someone who who was part of that entity\nAnd he's very funny because back in the days there was four people on stage was not to people and he was my voice so when he talks to me some time I get flashbacks because that's the guy\nWho did my vocals so we have a good time with touching people with the classics and uh we get we're looking more and more shows get to hear about the fact that we're performing together and people were coming to find that he's a great guy [noise]\nThese local species that you

within the north slope of the mountains\nAt some point somebody with a motion sensor hunting camera\nWill likely capture another one on film and I hope they do I think it would be fantastic if we saw them re populated area would be um really awesome\nFor me it was just important to know that we can do these types of studies and we can show the importance of why we need to protect these lands it's important to know that we share them with the native species and so knowing that we have\nA robust wild and diverse population of different species is really valuable\nI was able to combine something

I was that it was so old could\nBits and pieces fell off the set this was entirely different she gave I guess what I Would only be described as ... remarkably confidence and steady defense of capitalism ... conservatism as she called it an most particularly of coal\nHer approach to ... she was basically scientific sort of have an activist look you may not like my dad was sort of free trade area deal with the European Union but think about all the alternatives the chaos of no jail over chaos of domestic domestic political turmoil and as you just suggested that possibly know prices at the whole\nBut as we all know she was speaking to a very divided audience were the signs of healing between the two sides\nHere's what I'd say about that she was left still standing despite gazing attacks by pro but particularly anti Europeans she room a much relatively unscathed but look she has no fans of the woods it really is important to remember these divisions over Europe have not gone out of way and\nOne speech of course doesn't change the view of many are in her policy about her weaknesses as a leader but here's the thing called a lot of people are thinking well maybe we should not perfect but time is running out through a place where after all Britain is supposed to be leaving the EU next march\nShe seems to have survived the comfort but the really hard task because you had ... had\nA I Would say so I mean she survived this but looking ahead she has just a matter of weeks now to try and get a deal with the European Union but she has\nSo little room to maneuver I don't think the u._s. gonna make many concessions because they see a divided weak governments in the u._k. a divided country why should they make concessions but she has little room from a new from she was to give too much away\nThe ... and the policy wouldn't like it if she went for no deal the pro Europeans and businesses what's I Walk on of all you're doing\nSo it's going to be immensely difficult to get that deal and then have to come back and sell it to a divided policy and like throw out one of the focus come up from these conferences you know a lot of diplomats foreign diplomats from friendly country has\nBeen a lot of them they were in Liverpool last week and they were in a bombing in this week and they said to me you know the politics of your country have gone mad so it gives you a sort of sense of the sort of talk that the reason that others are facing\nThe BBC's Rob Watson on event the governing conservative party's annual conference which is now come to an end in ... [noise]\nNow it's ... I Believe they found the first some evidence of the existence of an ex so mood that the moon orbits the planets outside our own solar system the team from Columbia University in the U.S\nHad seen data from the NASA Kepler space telescope studying the perimeter of nearly three hundred planets which had hinted that the existence it's such a moon professor David ... from the teen told me that they use it the more advanced Hubble Telescope had been the game changer\nWe always thought they were very likely to exist because I mean the current system we see so many of them so I think the real question was not so much whether they exist at all but one of the properties how big do they get\nWhy is it important to tablets days\nWe're interested in ... for a few reasons one of them is that these men could be ... in that ran right I Would say that something that science fiction plays plays with a lot has a lot of fun with that idea things like that and go for Star Wars or did the idea is that\nI Would say that something that science fiction plays plays with a lot of it has a lot of fun with that idea things like\nA ... for for example in Star Wars or do you the idea is that maybe means my affects the habits of the of the planet that they orbit we think the moon\nDoes influence the U.S have seen fast by stabilizing the liberty of thee for example\nAnd finally we want to understand how moons phone we only really have a few example was a ... system the earth moon appears like a maybe a one off event but is it may be the inevitable outcome a planet formation by looking at the moon's outside of our solar system we have to be able to\nDo to deep understanding of how these things are those in the first place\nSo just to be clear is there an assumption that if a planet has the mood and going round it's at least one there is more chance to do that that might be life on the planet\nNot necessarily but I think if we find a notice twin for example one of the questions you might ask if you're interested is habitable is whether it has a moon twin\nAs well as for example as I said that liquid ... destabilized by the ... but also even tights we know the ocean tied on the U.S are driven by the presence of the main and so early tides especially when the man was much closer to us and early in our history and even ... played a role in kick starting life on a planet\nWhere is this possible first discovered XO moon\nIt's a long way away eight thousand like it is a a we might be traveling that anytime soon Amish want us to actually most distant stars that kept to look at 'em and that's why it was so challenging for us to pull off this detection and why we needed additional tell us get time to do it\nRight the Hubble Space telescope enabled they did it\n[noise] that's right so we threw a hint of their signature with a capital data we had three ... of the planet in front of the stock three times that of the planning for him to the style from that as we thought we saw a wiggle that could be a main um but we didn't have a conclusive evidence that points so we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope\nAnd are we able to get a much more convincing sticking out of that you\nMust be looking for the tiniest ... said some way so distant\nThat started that tiny signatures in in ... we really see two signatures which give away the moon we can tell the planet comes into its eclipse ... about an hour to LA that tells us that something is\nPulling on the planet gravitationally and we think that the moon and the second signal that we see is a bit in the brightness of the style which has caused by the moon passing in front of the style the shadow of the moon if you like in front of the south so these are tiny signature but we think we have strong evidence for them\nIt's a thrilling possibility of extraterrestrial life that that most people have felt at some stage and in light something that actually drawing the scientific Korea\nI think so I mean there are certainly are some of my colleagues who work on looking to accept clients who are like to say that they really didn't like the question of how the whatsoever but for me it's always been the logical and point of this endeavor when we're looking folks on it like things I mean\nI think a fundamental question of fundamental driving force behind why we do this has to understand a uniqueness in the universe how unique because there is the solar system and indeed ourselves um said to me looking for life on these worlds one day\nIs um the final part of that question\nThat was professor David keeping from Columbia University in the U.S telling a story about the best evidence yet of the existence of an ex so moving don't forget if you want to

way of the u._k. and in the long run this will be a plus projects [noise]\nThis is value appreciation because we get more back for the power when we have more of a sudden we use also for the food is very important that we still will have\nA lower electricity fries than in a\nNeighboring countries but those\nWho worry that the cost will go up a justified and that can that\nThe price will go up a little bit when you connect through your mouth because you have a larger markets filters in the end of the price will not be a much change but it's a little bit because of the cable in a situation

Trump's I on the edge of the optics are cool\nJust did the arguments about climate change about noise tussle if you like between the rich is as a fossil fuels and the clean green energy of hydro electricity did they seem quite far away\nNo actually not the tone and we can feel if not the fear we can feel that we are sensing future that we may be a actually a\nIn our area as we may have the rights of temperature between seven and Fifteen degrees\nAs long as that actually the one point five may have greater impact on our area\nAre you seeing the way that the weather is melting the ice and so on you know this is just because of the Arctic area being more vulnerable than the rest of the world than the the impact may be as big as the end of course it's unpredictable\nWe don't know at this point what will actually happen\nBut locally we\nOf course have a very strong connection to nature we depend on the clean Arctic waters and oceans and we have done so far thousands of years and we are dependent on the uh the oceans giving us actually the fish\nOn which we live on which we live in ... if you want to sell I Know you've got quite radical plans to Trump's say if you want to set a radical plan that you'd see in combating climate change is it easier for you to sell\nI Know your citizen I don't know if you're just eats yeah but we are now facing a transformation of our local infrastructure for instance next year we will have people to pay for\nExample for driving the car aiming them to drive less aiming them to emulate but hey you should try yeah yeah I was self with the aim of driving less because we need people and how do people take that of course it's not easy there is\nYeah yeah I ... when the aim of driving less because we need people\nAnd how people take that if an idea of course it's not easy there is a ... every change in every society eh it challenging but people tend to understand that there needs to be change and the city has to ban the

all this money to fulfill fields and yes actually trying to lead the way on the\nNews of course the thing is back in those days we actually we are very lucky that we were able to face that finding of the oil the way that we did\nAnd now using the oil so that they will be over you and good for generations to come actually very long after the oil itself has sort of feel that the so to speak at by of
