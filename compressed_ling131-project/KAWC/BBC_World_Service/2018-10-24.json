to you about why they were unhappy\nMost of the workers where students who came from far away they shed their worries with me because they saw that I've already had life experience I Lived in modern history and so\nI had a lot of capacity of listening because of that they started focusing their problems to me and then that led me to try to help them\nWith someone else to that at sea without to

and it was hard work but then one day he's the boss was demoted\nAnd as a direct result of that he also suffered a pay cut and ended up in a position where the fossil fuel prospects when he came to the workshop but it was clear that he had blamed himself for what had happened\nLike that she worked out that he himself couldn't resolve this problem\nThat he wasn't to blame and that the company and his position wasn't the most important thing\nThese days he's thankful for his life and to [noise] he's able to laugh now [noise]\n\nSometimes friends of mine worry about that I spend too much time dealing with these heavy subjects I understand why that things that I tell them the ... to me my conversations with the participants a boom and positive conversations\nIn these conversations I can

more at constant contact dot com and by progressive\nWe started just pounding on a panel with our fists and Gabriel\nTook the brunt of most of that effort [noise] get real setting on the ... he was too tired to continue ... punching the panel with his fist so we started actually using his head and using his life as leverage to push the panel of words\nAnd he was able to actually make more progress that way but he put so much forced into it that the handrail actually broke off of the side of the elevator\nAnd that was a bit of a scary moment because I was holding cell phone at that point and we both fell into the water [noise]\n\nYou might have nearly dropped your phone emotion before amended that anxiety it's got nothing on the cell phone that was the only way out but I manage to keep the cellphone dry as we were falling into the water\nHands and head bleeding finally they were able to reach true the panel at the top of the elevator and get just enough signal to place the cold to emergency services\nWe were yelling at the water's the water's rising it's not stopping we're stuck in the elevator we may only have ten maybe Fifteen minutes left of time to breathe before the elevators completely submerged that night because of all of the flooding there was Ninety eight percent more emergency calls than normal\nAnd the fire department or they weren't able to get a hold of them so nobody could confirmed that they were on their way and the same thing with the police the entire time we thought that nobody was even dispatched yet and by that by then the water was almost at our shoulder levels\nBut that was two people that had the dispatches called partners comfortable run by net and comfortable Josh mcsweeney\nYeah we were right up some notes or we just finished a cold and just parked the car and so just look by timing you know the call came over\nIt was lock lucky because the comfortable with just a few blocks away and lock because they weren't even meant to receive that cold they share a band radio frequency with another police division\nYeah so we share a band with twelve division which is our neighboring division\nThey had something like okay this is the twelve division and then they give you the description of the event to exactly and the dispatcher that night said over the radio that the next school was not for them that the twelve division\nGive you the description of the event to exactly and the dispatcher that night said over the radio that the next school was not that then that the twelve division and\nThere's two people trapped in the elevator it was a very different call you don't get that too often you may hear about some being trapped in the elevator but not when water is now rising through the elevator\nWhat'd you of being within your rights to as I said oh this is for another division it's not specifically for us we don't have to take that call yeah like that that could happen they didn't have to\nBut the court seemed so a gym and the building was by chance so close by\nAnd so we hear the call we jumped on it we can hear the dispatcher she's becoming more excited on the radio saying the water's rising it's going to rather quickly and so as we're going our thinking oh my gosh regular faster and faster so we start going lights and sirens\nWhen you got that what was the scene\nFortunately there was about four or five people by the elevators that are right there that are already trying to help out\nTo people in the building directed to police officers ... down to the basement\nOr kind of a sudden those kinda funny as we're going there was one guy that was quite adamant for us we should use the elevator you know and so like it's working you should use it it'd be quicker or like I don't think we're going to use that elevator\nSomewhat misguided I feel like it might be a an obvious case in point as to why that throughout I I don't know [noise]\nSo wisely the police officers choose the stats but the building is so flooded it that they can only just see the top of the door to the basement\nAnd I just said Ryan I'm like I'm I'm looking at that rate is that the the word that we're looking at the top you know\nAnd then run just looked at me for that has changed like well we got to go and then just really took off his belt and his chest and then to start walking in the water\nLaw and\nThe offices are inundated with Nike smelly wars to buy to are able to get into the basement and they swim others add to the elevator doors and\nI can hear them now panicking their police officers were drowning please help us\nWe heard people kind of a muscle and talking on the other side of the elevator and I'm trying to find a way to open up\nAnd then we just start pulling on the door but it's locked [noise]\nAnd by this point how much had to have risen from when you arrive\nFoot maybe on our side and so we kind of happened as soon as quick somewhere on the other side\nWe didn't even know at that point if they had enough time to get us out before we ran out of breathing space that because they were struggling to open in\nThan comfortable buying that goes to get a ... to help which opened the door the officers can barely reach the floor that basically trading wars have plus an orderly pulling against the strength of the door that also fighting strength of the ...\nFirst we started on the right side and Ryan started try to pry the right side of the elevator and then it wasn't budging than I Try wasn't budging so then I asked the two guys in the inside if they can remember which way the door open 'cause it could have been the middle that opens the rights I left side\nThey didn't know which way the elevator door open and I just remember thinking in my mind like I Am not going to die over a year left my right situation\nBut they could you remember which way the dog\nIt Gabriel I think had had a good idea which way it open and then we we agreed because it it was the only way that it made sense because that's how panicking how ... we had is that the we we didn't know which way the elevator doors open normally when we got up to the elevator that we use every day\nNo one remembers that yeah I mean I'm sure everyone that's listening is going to think about that now [laughter] yeah remember jumping into back into the water and at this point\nYeah I mean I'm sure everyone that's listening is going to think about that\nNow [laughter] yeah remember jumping into back into the water and at this point the water was that about just at the bottom of my neck I yelled out to the police officers that I'm standing facing the elevator doors and the door opens to my left I'm facing the elevator doors wide open to my left and that's that's what I remember saying\nAnd so Ryan has a crow Barnes is right away just you know went to the left side and uh poodles forced into it and uh he was able to pop it\n[noise] the doors open [noise]\nWhen those doors open [noise] uh that was the first one that I knew that if that were going to see her family's again [noise] ... very difficult to explain the feeling that like relief\nOr far yeah\nI'd say a combination of of both it's not any one one\nFeeling but then it was also a feeling of finally uh letting my survival instinct in that adrenalin subside [noise]\nI did lifeguard and training as a child and I forgot how to swim for about three seconds as I'm getting out of the elevator yeah\nHe's like I Can't I Can't swim I Can't swim so Josh grabbed him and they ended up swimming to the door\nOr so we can go to the basement [noise]\nIt's almost like I just let the police\nOfficer dragged me out because that was the first moment that I can let myself I'm relaxing like a whole body just sort of\nLike a [noise] yeah [noise] if they had arrived five or ten minutes later [noise] what'd you still be alive [noise]\n\nWe played around with the idea of that I used to think about it in a you know in parallel universes what's what's going on with different versions of yourself from physics or quantum mechanics but I'm pretty sure that in some versions or I saw other universes I'm I didn't make it out of there\nI think I was more rattled then I then I realized I'm immediately afterwards at one point I had the realization that almost died ... how do you deal with that I think I cried for about two or three seconds and then put myself together\nThe officers left they didn't get to say much Gabriel ... and then they went on and just lay awake in bed\nI slept for maybe two hours at night and you're replaying things in your head and [noise]\nIs overwhelming that really started soaking in on the way back to the station the gravity of the situation and you start realizing that did reach it's safe to people's lives in a um so yeah so then you get kind of a second rush of adrenaline\nI guess it's probably hard to to think of yourself in the way that people describe you which is of course and using the ... hero but I mean did you have a moment of patting yourself on the back that night I didn't [noise]\nI was telling Josh today even 'cause we work together as like I still have a hard time thinking of using not work\nWell you might not be able to describe yourself that way but what would you hold on one second I just got I got to do something really quickly\n[noise] greeted told me that part of the condition of agreeing to this interview was that he wanted to thank the offices for what they've done and that I could connect them so I called him [noise]\n[noise] you know it's\nNice to to finally talk to you that's for sure\n[noise] I mean I never wanted\nTo maybe just something that I don't ... enjoy good barbecue can the police\nOh absolutely I always enjoy good barbecue can I\nGet the police officer talking to an engineer yet so typically not the most emotionally expressive people on the planet but I could tell that they mean a lot to them to speak and what better way to show your feelings than three grills me any way\nThey experience has after all changed clean them\nIt would be a complete ... to say no one of the things that has definitely changed is that ... at the time that a happier even though the small problems that we have an a day to day basis I was appreciative of even having to stand in line at the or the
