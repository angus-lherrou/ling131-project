hope that he will have a chance to live\nIt breaks her heart but she goes back to the rice fields and the boy it's taken in by nuns who are in a children's home in a city called sun tech near Ho Chi Minh city at the time known as signed on the baby's name is to eat\nAt the age of three to have contracted polio and was put on an adoption register and hope that someone might take him in and help with his health care along came Christian and Thomas ... an American couple who are visiting Vietnam they were interested in adopting children from difficult backgrounds to try to give them a better life\nSo they went to the orphanage inside jak where they found to eat\nIt wants to be a milestone moment for him by Nineteen Seventy four he had left for Berkeley on the west coast of the United states about to start a new life as part of a loving an unconventional family with many holidays to celebrate\nIn America I have six brothers and sisters to more Caucasian or I have a older brother

family makeup we did do every single holiday from ... to Christmas to Hanukkah to a Vietnamese New Years\nDespite being so young when he came to the United states to me was traumatized by the war he left behind in Vietnam his adopted mother Christian told him that when he first got to have a new home in California he was afraid to go outside and would hide food that people gave him to store for later\nIt was interesting because into these memory his trauma wasn't about Vietnam at all what was more traumatizing in those early days for him would be in and out of hospitals because of the ... contracted in Vietnam\nYeah I mean I was on her like completely honor that they even invited me the table so to just have a loosening up get past the formalities now is just amazing for me I mean that's one of those experiences that you'll never ever forget\nIt wasn't just about rubbing shoulders with high ranking officers for two week about being accepted by his own people and be with them

have to loosen up get past the formalities that was just amazing for me I mean that's one of those experiences that you'll never ever forget\nIt wasn't just about rubbing shoulders with high ranking officers for two week about being accepted by his own people and be one of them comes like that and yet in any general with such a big moment it had a strong impact on him\nSo when he went back to America he wanted to know all the Japanese food culture and the language that he'd forgotten he became friends with some local young people who also been adopted from Vietnam to try to get closer to his roots\nI figured that you know the next time that I was going to go to Vietnam I was going to be at least a little more prepared so the thing is is like even though I mean America I I went to like little Saigon and I hung out of the coffee shop\nHe would go to a friend's house to eat on me and learn the language or at least try to learn a language one of those things are getting married and getting on to this was a chance to go back to ... or signed on as to he still calls that\nI wanted you know that second opportunity to look for my family I went there the first time but says we're a you know members of the of the peace committee and whatnot and it wasn't right now had a birth certificate it said mother and father are known but it was signed by nuns\nDowning so that so I figured that I Would try to at least go to see the city of ... that\nI'm sort of if I didn't find my parents know that I'd been there and that the people\nWould be the reflections of my parents are who I Would have been if I grew up in Vietnam when my mind going back to Vietnam second time trying to go to so that was not easy at all we stayed in a little mini hotel my our guy was a you know army or used to be an army general whatever and have like a little two bedroom\nA motel and ah we rented a car through him and we went down the first time I had my friend David dang and um that\nThey are also a disabled Vietnamese from the war\nOr to do my translation cars still at that point my Vietnamese was basically hello one two three four and um that's about it\nWhat is it easy to get around when you say easy because we're on crutches you know I I could get in the vehicles and whatnot but like going to the restroom and stuff like that was an issue because back then the toilets were just\nYou know the two footprints in the hole in the ground so drives you find somewhere just sit on or or have redefined the bachelor just sort of hang your posture over a lot of work\nUsing the bathroom wasn't the only obstacle to he faced on that initial journey down to get in the south as we are now\nWe went trying to go down the ... like the bridges out\nSo [noise] um there was like no way for us to go across so my friend\nUm when I had they went to the orphanage that took my paperwork that people work that I had my passport my will rise Vietnamese passport and my my birth certificate and on that birth certificate there's a a nun that's signed it just as a way and they\nUh they told her that says right does not work there anymore she actually works in ... which is the other major city down on the mic on delta [noise]\nSo we we ended up going there we didn't go to so that that time 'cause the bridges out we found her sister does re when she was amazing um you know she's all like not that many uh or friends have come back you know\nVietnamese passport and my my birth certificate and on that birth certificate there's a a nun that signed it just disarray and they uh they told her that says right does not work there anymore she actually works in ... which is the other major city down on the mic on delta [noise]\nSo we we ended up going there we didn't go to so that that time 'cause the bridges out we found her and says or does re wish it was amazing um you know she's all like not that many ah or friends have come back you know to find the ... the birth family\nShe apologized and said that you know that was during the time of war records may not have been taking care of people move people die so finding someone that you're willing to have is\nYou know one in a million but she offered to\nBe like my surrogate mom well and and that that what was that like man that for me that was amazing I mean I like I got a flash in in my my hands like I felt so good you know it was just like\nOkay you know or maybe not gonna find them but I'm okay with that\nYou know because she said that if I needed to I could bite her and whatnot and she could uh be my\nMom and and so at that point it was awesome it was the right thing to say and you know after that first initial trip I was like in my mind okay I had already made up my mind that I was never going to find\nThat I was never going to find my parents\nNow that points to we have made peace with the idea that he wouldn't find his parents and it was more than content with finding sister got me but he would still determined to make that difficult journey to Santa\nFor me it was a matter of closing a chapter at that point in my life I just wanted to close the chapter I Want to do sort of make right in my mind that I've done what I could do\nAll I wanted to do that the trying to go back before I left because I didn't know when I was going to come back from Vietnam\nWas go down to ... find the church maybe give some money to the nuns thank them for taking care of me\nYou know looking around the city figuring that those people in the city of reflections of my parents come back up and go back to America and just sort of close that chapter in the book [noise] go back to college you know become an American become an artist become whatever but then really focused\nAnd you do make it to sat back and you do make it back to the orphanage ... which is amazing in itself how did you feel when you when you made it back to the orphanage ... did you remember anything\nComing down you know are the roads are terrible as it was like a five hour six hour drive but you know just the anticipation I had a few hundred dollars because I was planning to to leave a Vietnam like three days after four days after something like that so we will have that much time\nGave it to ... which still with him helping out with the translation he could speak to the ...\nYou know the nuns are greeted us we had a tour around the little a school or whatever church\nWe showed them I ... I was here at you know Nineteen Seventy one ... and you know I I had three hundred dollars I gave them three hundred dollars and like I have like to thank you very much you know I Want to give you a little something I don't have much I mean I'm only twenty\nUm but you know so we're sitting there they come and they have like um\nThese like frozen yogurt that were eating and\nOne of the non she like totally leaves she got back and she's carrying like a legit\n[laughter]\nMy ...

there's my picture\nAnd it says when you talk to you\nYou know I my birth certificate and then on my passport I came over to America would win corporate and we didn't know whether it was my original maimed or whether it was made up so that the paperwork she can be done and [noise] so you can send them to America but I've seen that a knowing my maybe pictures like oh my gosh that's made\nYou found you three thirty he found maybe you I was a totally\nAmazing I was totally stunned\nUm you know and and and then of course I looked at mother and father okay first of all I I didn't speak Vietnamese I really didn't know what anything said [laughter]\nIt was my friend that was really tried very but under a ... mother and father was unknown right and you look down to less than it does say polio so I'm like\nI was like wow okay at least on the ... we don't know about them or anything like that so I'm not totally like afford\nI felt like my my ... my my my blood with boiling like I was all lightheaded but when I was like wow that's awesome and I wanted to know more but I didn't know but then\nThe non started introducing me to people\nWho would have been in the ... the same time I had been you know whether the order younger but around the same age and I I thought that was kinda weird I came there when I was a week old\nI laugh maybe year two years [noise] ah like I'm going to remember so I found that really odd and they actually introduced me to this one one girl who was actually older than me by seven years\nAnd back then during the war and what not a lot of times the older girls took care of the younger kids like carrying round feeding him on and it turned out that that woman\nThat they introduced to me was her name was a fair\nShe does not live in the orphanage anymore she lives out in the countryside and that morning she decided to come into town to visit a relative in the hospital but whenever she comes you just said that she always dropped by the nuns and says Hi and whatnot and so they show in the picture and she's all like\nDude I I Know your mom\nSofter only here where he really get to meet his birth mother stayed with that you're an outlet you find out what happened next I'm ... and this is the extraordinary journey which get three gentry bumping our own away from the United states where he lived to Vietnam where he was born\nTo re gentry bumping our own away from the United states where he lived to Vietnam where he was born to me it wasn't just searching for his birth parents he was also searching for the last part of his identity more on that when we come back\nI'm In college I don't have that much but you know I I wanted to let her know that I was doing OK\nIt had been an exhausting gay for everyone including two eats friends trying to translate these huge emotional conversations sully heading back to Ho Chi Minh city taken to his mom with ...\nI'm In college I don't have that much but you know I I wanted to let her know that I was doing OK\nIt had been an exhausting gay for everyone including two eats friends trying to translate these huge emotional complications sunny heading back to Ho Chi Minh city taken to his mom with them\nYou know it was like the longest drive back up to Saigon that I've ever had I mean I sat there and had flashes of crying she cried were happy we're you know just everything and then we got back to the ah many hotel I mean here in the room you know we've eaten something it's time to get ready for bed\nAnd and so I'm sitting on the floor I have leg braces and uh 'cause I'm walking crutches and I take off my parents and and she can see these like British is a plastic and steel and I'm I'm ... and I take the socks and she grabs my legs to look and she was completely\nLike overwhelmed a\nPie by by my polio she didn't know that I had a shared I'd gotten sick but you know doesn't know the extent of anything or she didn't know whether she heard that had gone up to Saigon and gone to America but you know during the time war you don't know you know people say whatever but\nFor her to really look at my legs you know I learned later that she she was really sad and that ah her sad this was the fact that she gave me in her mind such a difficult life you know being disabled or whatnot\nAnd so we we finally get on the bed and she's sitting there at ... this is the first time you know having among other like a mother mother my adopted mother is great but like you know I'm Twenty years old and an all of a sudden I'm\nLying my hand on her lap and she's sitting there just looking down at me and I'm completely exhausted and I'm trying to\nTo get some sleep because I Know that tomorrow I I have to go see this other piece walk I keep picking up at her well trying to sleep and and she just looking out at me and she doesn't blink she hasn't move\nShe's just sitting there she's completely silent and she she I don't think she ever thought that she would ever be able to find me because she knows that because of the poverty and Vietnam and you know after the war and all that stuff that there's no way for her to even begin a search\nTo eat you told me earlier that you had this fantasy about meeting your mom and that you were in this field and you're laughing and the sunset and it was kind of his id idealistic picture and and there you were lying down on her lap her looking at you what we say what was the reality of being with your mother\nWas a it the picture was completely wrong [laughter]\nBut um\nI don't know it's like there's just so much I wanted to do and so much I wanted to say I wanted to do something a for her to let her know my sincerity I didn't have money to really give to her and so I went out I had long hair\nDown my back and I went and had a a a rated and cut and then I came back with my friend and he sat down and I presented her my\nPonytail and I told her I don't have that much but I Want this to be gift you you remember the sun that you lost the SAT\nDo and so much I wanted to say I wanted to do something or for her to let her know my sincerity I didn't have money to really give to her\nAnd so I went out I had long hair down my back and I went and had a a a rated and cut and then I came back with my friend and sat down and I presented her my my ponytail and I told\nHer I don't have that much but I Want this to be gift you you remember the sun that you lost the sadness that we had a not going up together of ... not being able to take care of me but also I made a promise to her\nThat that I Would try to with all my heart make a life with her after\nDuring this time to you also found out that he had an older biological sister as well as my half siblings but you still had one burning question for his birth mother\nAsked her you know who's my father uh where's my father he out in the rice fields and she said well your father's Filipino like Filipino\nPeople wonder why we're on to something\nI guess they do something I did I I I was all I Know I've been amazed you know I must be mountain Vietnamese that's why I like it [laughter] so after asking about my father my mother is like ah\nMy father's Filipino or his name is fun to lay on my chair as he lives in Columbus so good and that's all she had a little bit and paper\nAnd then of course I I wanted to go to the Philippines again I didn't know how it's going to do that when I was going to do that and Colombia Laguna Columbia Laguna has like\nFifty for a neighborhoods so it just is completely daunting\nAnd it turned out my father and America was going to sing with the Philippine national orchestra about Jose resolved with a\nFrancisco Feliciano so I use that opportunity\nSo we got there I had a little times I rented a car or I actually went with my my er my father I'm from America we go to Columbia Laguna from a manila it's like sixty miles or something like that\nI had no idea what we're doing you know I figured you know would go look around again maybe you know someone suggested going to the ... office so we get you know I Walk in and and lo and behold like\nRight to the ... is this office has said bureau missing persons\nAnd I was just like

World Service the time in the newsroom is Seventeen twenty three I'm trying to mental health something we often talk about on the west today is world mental health ... might have seen those as a global trend um many so much as I did somebody loves his report from Ghana\nAbout concerns with traditional healing Centers for mental health issues and they're it's been one of the most watched videos on our side over the past twenty four hours earlier and sully joined me ask you to live yet the ...\nFrom the BBC Mina team who's been gathering young people's experiences of mental health issues around the world and I started by asking Olivia what sort of stories she's been hearing\nA competing mix and I think that diversity of experiences that people have depending on what country that from the not even that depends on what community group that from the algae chi chi community or staged disability but particularly on the conversation that's been happening all ... today is about ... black mental health math is not ... to people\nFrom around the world from Nigeria South Africa et cetera have been speaking to us about ... minutes they face and the lack of support that they had and that we have from one\nTwenty three year old woman coots ET who lives into hundreds that conversation\nAround it is still theory taboo we need to be more sensitive towards it to allow people to speak up about what you're going through with out being labeled\nNeedy crazy attention seeking if like myself you cannot see professional how surround yourself with people who are understanding and remember to always be gentle with yourself\nSo words from each of their tanks to her as suddenly is also with us I mentioned his piece from Ghana study good to have you with us very distressing to watch or reports perhaps for those that have no ... watched it yes a tell us a little bit of what your investigation found\nThis investigation was a prayer comes in a traditional healing senses the common knowledge that are these people treat a lot of people with mental health issues so we've got a few of them and what we found was it was a picture we found everywhere people a lot of them\nTo her as suddenly is also with us I mentioned his piece from Ghana ... good to have you with us very distressing to watch her reports perhaps for those that have no ... watched it yes at tell us a little bit of what your investigation found\nThis investigation was a prayer comes in a traditional healing senses the common knowledge that are these people treat a lot of people with mental health issues so we're just at a few of them and what we found was it was a picture we found everywhere\nPeople a lot of them crumbs up in a in a room with chains all over the out relax tied to a wall or pillars in the room because there was this particular come we went to a prayer come where they had moved from chains and then they put them in cages is very very small rooms with\nMetal bowl with big popular on them and it's it's it's very difficult for an adult to move around in these cages and very distressing\nAnd I think is well that's something interesting in that it's it's not just gone at that faces they kind of issues and they've kind of stigma attached she'll see that's a very extreme example but interesting anything she looked at in other woman ... she's from Nigeria and she was saying you know I grew up in a place where I thought how Disney such thing as depression had\nSimply because people just don't talk about that and sometimes it soul mates a kind of silence that can be harmful when it comes to people trying to communicate or even deal we even acknowledge that they might have a mental health issue\nBecause certainly I mean chaining people has been outlawed for for some reason it continues\nYes the the problem with this is the enforcement of the law some of these ... they said they don't have any alternative and they they can't keep aggressive fish and some other ... about the ... and they moved away from it\nBut at the stepping issue is they've moved away from the chimney and no use in cages which is even more serious\nAnd with the ... places that people go family sometimes bring out other family members that are very distressed and there is just a lack of psychiatrists and I suppose the mental health system within the country\nThe infrastructure for mental health treatments is very little very very small and and poor and you know the numbers of psychiatry is in the country or I just know great so they are about Eighteen psychiatry in the country of the population of about twenty seven million people fast\nSo that mean that is some Fager yeah so obviously there's a GOP which must be field and these ... field is ... and you know also there's a stigma and that's not a lot of education about mental health\nSo people think that if I have a condition which is mental which is mental I Need to go to a prayer come 'cause the spiritual to get help\nAnd indeed I mean again just to kind of have a sense of international residents I mean again the talking about going ahead that this is something that is that they

these ... comes aware that there is a bad in India and and and they probably are thinking of moving away from their chaining ... office a little bit of hope the government also seemed to be to be ready to enforce the band that's also offers a little bit of hope\nIn previous years it became a nuts and the sheep and now ... what a government would've policymaking standing actually provide the
