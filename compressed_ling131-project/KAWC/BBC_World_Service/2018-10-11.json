fully its rockets and he ... he understands went from\nThere sitting on the top of the rocket in a Soyuz capsule and that part of the rocket\nCapable of blasting away from the rocket such that they can go on a different trajectory and then once all that separate than the process begins to bring the capsule back to earth which involves losing the crew compartment and the shroud slow way and then\nThey have to get on a trajectory to slow them down a little bit so that the parachutes can deploy which eventually lead them to drop to the ground somewhere in Kazakhstan\nI it sounds so dramatic is incredibly tricky to pull off\nWell it's done automatically for the most part of the crew will monitor what's going on they know what's supposed to happen next and when and they monitor that closely and they're ready to provide commands to the system computers if necessary but for the most part it's automatically does so\nAssuming that all of that worked properly the crew\nSimply monitored and make sure everything was going well\nWe're hearing that they seem to be find that it's going to spend one nice in hospital which is also incredible\nYeah the you know ... entry is can be

about\nThat is part of it yeah I mean space and had commercialize it various space tourists companies are such lactic a Richard Branson we have from him any this week\nTalking about that being a quiet you know imminent space tourism to be launched by his company blue origin space acts or other companies in in the in the game and um and this is probably the big fuss commercial opportunity for for for companies who want to make some money out of space aerial that global she's the founder of the MIT Media lab\nExploration initiative I'm One of her areas of study has been creation of comical ... space homes\nFor tourists to stay in once they grow up there\nRight now the market that we're looking at 'em in the near term it that these trades and like I said being able to support flexible

is quite a sight to bitch ... clicking together or anyone who's ever tried self assembly furniture that is certainly a it's a joy joy\nBecause these things a false you big if you think you really gotta you putting up very very small payload space 'cause every pound on the low cost and they have to also be assembled probably robotically or semi sickly or not because they didn't want to be putting people out there to do the assembly\nNow I'm thinking like why can't they put my furniture together but anyway you know whatever they want the technology to do to space um but also some other surprising ways to make money\nYes I mean you can uh you can do all kinds of things that saying one of the idea is is um space mining from tourism closest you need lights systems for people to go up there but if you can send robots up\nOr they can actually take the money for you it's thought that was space mining is focusing on water which you can find in abundance like asteroids impulsively the moon and I'm quite sure what they're thinking about this can be easily access but if you have robots um they can maybe do the training for you in\nAn age to air is very useful to provide fuel and

world can get a\nYou know just like to females all two miles it just doesn't happen to do it happened so that was wearing the natural world can do about that later and if you will but this was really a study trying to break the rules of reproduction ready to try to figure out why it is the mammals need a man and a woman or a male and female in order for these babies and so\nIf you just have the two bits of DNA together take born mouse and another female mouse's his son was to get it doesn't really work well you have to use a very precise amounts of genetic tinkering in order to make those two\nCompatible and that's what this team of research the Chinese come you saw some don't try to figure out exactly what it is the need to do in order to make those bits of DNA from two female mice impossible to produce a viable offspring so very complicated\nYes but to that but there is no male genetic material whatsoever\nThere is no matter what your material whatsoever in these ... and they attempted to do the opposite experiments just start with two male mice in charge of it all spring\nAnd they succeeded that each so they were able to create embryos and they were born but they they died when they're only about two days old say fall less successful and which one\nAnd this one the the mass live normal healthy life spans and then went on to have mouse pubs at the end when they bred normally with ... so the the female male mice yeah the the all female solution seems to work much more effectively than the male\nOkay um people are going to have lots of questions about this I mean does it have any ... for humans alive\nNa I'm well some researchers think the in the very very long time when the when the when the scientist says in the very long time they made a long time or a ... that it might help some same sex couples to make children a genetically related to themselves but the church is so far away it's hard to even describe him was\nBecause there are few safety concerns
