the house and rotten don't license tag numbers of cars that were in the driveway overnight and once we had that Susan and I wouldn't go and visit the woman he was with different woman every night so we we kept pretty busy\nHow many women did you get in touch with an oh\nI'm not sure how many I got in touch with and now that we found Thirteen that were diagnosed with HIV\nEach time one of these women got in touch with you to say yes I've been tested yes I'm HIV positive how would you react\nI Would cry I was just so devastated that this had been going on for so long I'd been seeing him for

democratic votes is arguing that has sent to the policies no longer on the fringe\nShe's not for the left she's really speaking out to what needs to happen it's it's the logical changed that needs to come from progressive systems of government\nSo you're saying the center of gravity of the Democratic party\nHas changed is changing the center of gravity for the whole country has changed because there are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical\nUh the history of our Democratic Party has been progressive always has I mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid this is just the next logical step [noise] uh I think it's progress of ever say\nAll right and do you mind if I ask you a couple more questions or I\nHave young they can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old amount of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to to the mayor of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo so think about this race for the house seat here as a bellwether indicator not only of how things are now\nBut how they may be drifting\nOver the next two years\nSeems to me that if Don Bacon\nOver the next two years\nSeems to me that if done bacon the Republican nominee winds here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female rural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning\nObjectively moderately to the right\nHere with the race at all as I Am head\nOn the doorstep counter eastern seems to be winning hearts minds ... votes but would it be enough for victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fund to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to the donor\nI Believe that there is a potential for a movement based on current political standings\nAnd maybe I should hope versus I\nHope not necessarily believe for that democratic votes said well earlier I spoke to rugs on MORNING political reporter with the Omaha world Harold she told me that is unusual congressional races shaping up to be the most expensive one this swing district has ever seen at at the moment she says the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEven raise one point two five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had before she got a lot of money from individuals as opposed to committees are groups are companies or whatever\nUm and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of figure head and progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district does as we heard that from the former ... become this bellwether for how the Democratic party is is running and where it is going\nYet so the um progressing groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones in this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs it something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top and the Democratic party or is it simply a national picture\nSo the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive than you are seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about mid some elections which don't generally get huge turnout and that's going to be key to that so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but we'll let necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that ... to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should get voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and the hurt and she's doing a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy trying to turn out the vote\nAnd you don't see many I've had a dumb bacon is sizzling bacon advocate but he said on the TV every coughing up but you don't see her\nShe does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might seem more ads from her because she got that one point two five million on but she also has been\nYou don't see it she she does have some and she's not focusing on it as much you might see more ads from her because she got that one point she five million but she also has been a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path\nThey take time what about the Trump factor how does how does he play into this race in this state so Trump um came here and spoke in Dayton stuck on stage with him on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet\nBut you're also seeing Republican mad about how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican winning is that they are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the ... these other women say that we are\n[noise] whereas I'm wearing a from a well how old she was speaking to news has changed car so I'm used to them in line Jamie I hesitate to suggest that the piece was anything other than to ... but have you got anything
