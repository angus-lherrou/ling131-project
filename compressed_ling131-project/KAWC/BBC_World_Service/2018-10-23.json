have gone there before\nAnd I was just a tap point at some that are which is where the photo was taken so Josh and I'd planned out a hike around ... point being a focal point that's on that\nSo we're on a hike and we made it tough point for Santa\nCruz kind of waiting around scope and things are planning some photographs out so I was actually during that time for that happened I was actually waiting for Josh to\nWalk out onto that same point took a couple of that so I was already over there with my camera ready and my son is ready anticipating Josh walk out but the couple had walked out

now photo I kind of ran over there to to try to figure out who the the mystery ...\nFor a few where those couple were not ... or\nSo after I snap a photo I kinda\nRan over there to to try to figure out who the\nThe mystery a couple of was a asked about twenty twenty five other people came up short because there is at least three to four other bride and groom photo shoots going on like twelve to ... and there had been at least thirty to forty people up there\nWhen I was up there at the same time so and Josh hadn't seen anything 'cause he was just kind of wandering around the pointing waiting waiting to\nTo walk out on there so\nSo you had seen this couple and the distance on a ledge you took the fight so did you realize how good the fights I was at the moment hitchhiking I always\nRotate

supposed to happen to her chocolate for post to catch this moment so I made sure\nAbout who just steal someone's thunder steel someone's photograph or anything like that so I looked around and there was there was no photographer and my immediate vicinity so [noise]\nSo we think is a couple who uh is a very special moment a moment to propose so I guess you would think they'd want to help his folks

truly special moment for them for them to be able to hold onto it with you know knowing that some stranger capture their proposal I think that would be amazing\nAlthough I guess we don't know if they said yes and we now he has his while a yeah maybe it was some kind of magazine shoots\nThat's all unknown to me which is kind of why I took to the Internet too it just because the whole thing was a mystery to me and I just I just generally want to find out who the ... or um I've talked to a couple of people up on that point at the same time a sense\nThey don't remember seeing anything so yeah
