begin\nA\nCatherine learned about those reports and many more later in fact she wrote a book about reading her file cold\nMy life as a spy investigations in a secret police filed but when ... first arrived in Romania she was an optimistic and ambitious twenty five year old with little idea of what Romania hadn't store\nI had been prepared by my upbringing to imagine that it would be a great place with people standing in long lines\nAnd I didn't find it to be that though there were plenty of lines I knew practically nothing about Romania I'd read a few books in English but my remaining at the time was not really good enough for me to read so under prepared scarcely begin to cover the states with which I went in\nThe one that I started off with was for ... which means folklore is then after that it was mostly name like\nThat a cockpit Vanessa keeping order violence that on a\nWhy you would never arrested I Believe that I was on the way to being arrested in Nineteen eighty eight because\nWithin about three weeks before I was leaving there are a number of documents send the file that have a very long title I Can't recall now\nBut the idea is a preliminary to bringing a penal

Seventy unfolding as most were superficial acquaintances especially hotel receptionist butter on Fifteen people she considered friends and two of the informants were particularly close to\nA few years after she got hold of a file in two thousand and eight she decided to approach these two close friends it was quite a remarkable\nSet of conversations she ended up part of a very long conversation by saying you did me so much harm and she feels that I should have known what I could be getting our into that I should have known better than she herself could know\nAnd that if I nonetheless persisted that meant that I was prepared to bring unpleasant is down upon her head I've thought about that a lot [laughter]\nVery peculiar ah Angola vision but I can see the logic to it that she explained why she decided to do this when she said that being taken to the secret police\nHeadquarters was terrifying enough because everybody knew what was in that building and here they were taking her through its a main doors\nAnd she also said that when she was quite young her grandfather was picked up on the day of her birthday and taken away to prison and they never saw him again\nAnd so she had always associated the secret police with horrible things so when these ... start out by saying well you know you have to know that we no longer work in the way that we used to like with your grandfather was she said immediately made her nervous\nThey kept saying it was important that she showed that she was a patriotic Romanian and tell them anything that I was doing that\nI shouldn't be doing and uh there might be a little problem with her job if she decided she didn't want to do that and so one way or another they in a very gentle manly like way threatened her\nAnd the second person that you you manage to meet up with had had a different reaction yes\nThis guy just made me furious all the things he was telling them that were very personal\nLike they'd ask him who he knew I might be sleeping with and he would come up with some names and things like that\nHe told me that many of the things that were in his reports were not things that he himself had known the officer would say who are you sleeping with and he'd say well I don't know when the officer would say how about you know a B and C\nAnd then the officer would say okay so can we write them in on your report so the officer was feeding him information that he didn't even know himself\nTheir honesty that that help you forgive or have you forgiven\nYes and yes there is a process that I went through of basically saying All right what right do I have to be so high and mighty about this what what I have done in that circumstance after I'd heard a number of people's explanations for\nWhat had been I'm done to them to get them to report I thought I Can't swear that I wouldn't have done the same myself and given the fact that many of them had agreed to inform so it's to protect their families or their job\nTheir honesty that that help you forgive or have you forgiven\nYes and yes there is a process that I went through of basically saying All right what right do I have to be so high and mighty about this what what I have done in that circumstance after I'd heard a number of people's explanations for\nWhat had been I'm done to them to get them to report I thought I Can't swear that I wouldn't have done the same myself and given the fact that many of them had\nAgreed to inform so it's to protect their families or their jobs and so on and I had never been put to that kind of pets\nBut you took it one step further you made the decision to go in and try and meet to try and understand and engage with some of the officers who had been on the other side of the spying that's right they told us about that\nI was sitting at my computer one day in New York and I thought how about I look up some of my ... officers [noise]\nAnd I got the streak address but no phone number for one and the phone number button no complete street address it was just the name of the street but no house number and these huge apartment buildings that means you've got hundreds and hundreds of people at a given street address so I went to the street\nOn which he was listed in I looked at every single house number and name\nUntil I found his and then I went off and bought a bunch of chrysanthemums as any good Romanian visitor would do ... and he answered and I said I have flowers for you and he ... me in\nSo I got up to the top of the stairs I was shaking like a leaf I thought my God what am I going to do now you know this is actually working\nAnd here with this guy standing out in front of his apartment door looking to see who is coming up\nHe was wearing some sort of khaki trousers and the or rather loose mustard colored Jersey he had a almost entirely bald head and the nights so closely trimmed white moustache and almost no teeth and I ended up in the flowers and he thanked me and then\nHe invited me into his apartment\nThere was a a chair right next to the door and that's where he ceded me and the most marginal possible locations\nAnd he stood in the doorway of the kitchen opposite and um then we've started a conversation that was mostly me I was a\nReally really nervous and also trying to be the most engaging possible person so that he would be willing to continue having this conversation so I started to remind him what I was doing and he said Oh yes I remember that he remembered the name of my landlord this was from forty years before\nAnd that my project had been about folklore and so on [noise]\nAnd then I'm reminded him that I had been stopped going into a military base and I said there was it was perfectly understandable that you might have thought I was involved in spying and that was when he began to smile and then he sat down\nAnd uh the conversation went on for about another hour hour and a half and it was quite friendly probably bothered you long enough so I should probably leave he held out his hand and said ah\nCome again next time we'll go out on the town border to mean for you what did you get out of that conversation I got a tremendous amount of confusion and\nUpset because this guy was perfectly nice and friendly and he was smart he didn't fit my stereotype of the secret police person at all I had this strong sensation that I had made a new friend and then the rational part of me would say you idiot you know this is\nLong enough so I should probably leave he held out his hand and said ah come again next time we'll go out on the town voted it mean for you what did you get out of that conversation I got a tremendous amount of confusion and\nUpset because this guy was perfectly nice and friendly and he was smart he didn't fit my stereotype of the secret police person at all I had this\nStrong sensation that I had made a new friend and then the rational part of me would say you idiot you know this is ridiculous you spend an hour and a half with a former secret police officer and you think that there's a new friend and\nYou said reading the fathers well strangely you started to wonder if if you really were a spy\n\nThat's called an interesting thing to say what did you mean by that well\nFirst of all they had a number of documents in which they said things like\nShe does the same kinds of things we do she puts pseudo names on the people she talks with so that they can't be recognized\nShe writes ... notes in a special code so that they are hard to read and so as I read the ways in which they are viewing me and seeing me as a possible spy I can see why it might appear that way\nSo they have a view of what spying is and when I Try to get inside their minds um it seems to me that I can follow their reasoning\nCatherine vetted read that and don't forget you can see one of the surveillance photos we spoke was taken of Katherine\nBy the secret police to visit our Facebook page search for outlook and of course will always love to hear

World Service we broadcast from the middle of this newsroom an update you on the stories as developments come in to us\nWhen the we've been hearing and talking about over the past our is the resignation of US ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley one of the most high profile women in the Trump Administration she became a tough local trend\nAlso as we look to ask her Twitter bio mentioned the UN is gone\nAnd take long or what ... um is with us as well we're going to go through the announcement in just a couple of minutes Hi Tara hello\nGood to have you back with us on a U.S first we got the team to put together a quick explanation on who Nikki Haley is\n[noise]\nNikki Haley is one of the most recognizable faces in the U.S administration she moved from politics as the south Carolina Governor to diplomacy when she accepted the role of the U.S envoy to the United nations and January two thousand Seventeen\nWhen she became governor in sweep out from the time for free money to do the job I mean youngest in the country\nWas using the U.S south\nI'm coming from an Indian family but she says she ...\nShe was born in raw to run down the law and was raised as a Sikh lasik investing to Christianity she's also spoken about racism she experienced while growing up\nKind of power and me who she up on the ... the parents\nFrom President Trump for her job with us\nShe was seen as the outside having being critical of a U.S president [noise] I'm Sorry to have to be describing her\nMother writes in voice in the White House turned\nOut to Mrs hey these high profile but that has been speculation about how positioning has south of the top job but she said she doesn't plan to challenge Mr Trump\nPushy prior to the max is currently unclear [noise]\nLike steady customs and Ben Davis on the ... same let's turn back to Tara ... who is in Washington DC so this was the scene that it was coming right to\nIt was it was a huge surprise I was in the downstairs in that building and the news flash on a screen and a woman who worked for the building was like what you know everyone was really surprised by it and she is one of the top woman and the administration and with her departure a very male White House will look even more male\nAndme knees speculation on why she might be leaving\nThere definitely was conflict between her and the president even during back in the campaign she used to say that she was a little worried about his tendency to shoot from the hip and she said you know something like that could lead to a World War and then back in August and twenty Seventeen when the president was talking about Venezuela he said that he wouldn't rule out a military option\nThe head and she said you know something like that could lead to a World War and then back in August and twenty Seventeen when the president was talking about Venezuela he said that he wouldn't rule out a military option and I was there and that moment during the press conference and she just looked at him like what are you talking about\nBecause only then now we have a chance to know what that the truth lies\nHer little bit about send them ... yesterday on the program do you think these allegations are taking place now\nLike sewing them before I have also spoken out and said that they have to allow these men to speak up and trust them\nBecause only then now we have a chance to know what that the truth lies\nHer little bit about send them ... yesterday on the program do you think these allegations are taking place now because the me too movement I mean it really was Fox of good twelve months ago\nIndeed India has been slow and even now I'd say it's it's a very very small drop in the ocean and the hearing of it because he would have gotten involved but the logical me too movement is really happening within the journalist it fraternity in India this was actually stopped\nBy an allegation against a standup comic artist ... the ... by a woman and then multiple women came out\nAnd because all of that happened on Twitter and then with some apologized it encouraged other women to stop speaking up\nSo really the key thing I think has been social media where the movement started taking his own life over the last couple of days and then it was not just sexual harassment act will face\nBut I'm enjoying this talking about bad behavior of me and journalists\nTalking about sexual harassment with colleagues over ... was naming and shaming them look quite a few pounds having anonymous as well and it has led to action so a lot of media houses have now is that you did a sexual harassment committees\nOr um you know to investigate these charges have off the men's journalist uh stepped onto the moment or can you stay away from physicians or follow where they come on\nTeam so some things that are very tangible you know we've also been speaking to people in India on the phone and asking their general reaction to sexual harassment allegations if they think me too movement is needed now in India let's hear from one\nRuining thing was his in his own thing from New Delhi or don't do that this movement of any use because the un and introduce you to really fix the system all ... and not let him read it but we do it by these women who have NO NAME in any industry and the uh just a newcomer\nTo get some being by making this let's go let's allegations against instead of this political industry women that do the murder or some amount of money and that is the more before making allegations\nIs that a prevalence you in India we are quite skeptical I ... a lot of like a ... a skeptical about what would it be the last thing impact of this and like I said especially in Bollywood which is more the part of the general conversation a you know the allegations amongst journalist is more being discussed within the journalistic certainty\nBut in Bollywood which is part of the logic on the mission\nThere is a lot of the fact that these men come on and\nWomen are seen as less credible and that is the problem that even these allegations have taken so long to come out despite me to being discussed would vote for the last one yet so that's why I said this is a drop in the ocean\nAcidity Ari Up thanks to her out of her voice to us\nDid you hear Luke yesterday Republican tater swift finally from Albuquerque he was angry at a post on us a singer had made on Instagram

about about the IMF package I Believe that this is not an ideal situation for the new government but they don't really have a choice at this point there is a massive forks deficit in Pakistan currently and that I mean that's from a very I'm Serious trade deficit or forty billion dollars\nWhich started from two thousand seven up until now and the new government is left with absolutely no other option but to seek this bailout because the terrorism situation in August on it and the energy crisis and focus on and the overall lack of investor confidence or the past and twelve years has led to a massive decline in exports and because of that Pakistan has\nA shortage of foreign exchange Pakistan's economy mind do is growing at a rapid pace probably the fastest pace for the past ten years but the FARC's\nA crisis has led to the situation where the government is seeking a bailout I Believe it is not an ideal situation it will lead to massive tightening up the belt which will obviously a trickle down and people will lose jobs but I Believe that in the long term the government is serious they're cracking down on corruption and I'm hopeful that in\nThe next coming years the situation will stabilize the exports will rise and we will be able to pay back our initial I Belong to the international monetary\nFund and other organizations so I Believe that this is a very good

next two years of the Trump presidency Republican county controlled both the house of representatives which is up for reelection in full\nOn the Senate stood at the seats are being contested but the Democrats are hoping to retake one or both houses of Congress\nBut will like the veteran journalist and author Thomas Frank has long been a shop left wing critic of the party arguing that has turned its back on its traditional working class opposes and become defined by what he called smugglers and complacency which culminated in Donald Trump's election\nHis new book ... with oblivion reports from a sinking society ... what he calls a period of sinking liberal hubs I lost but to Thomas Frank on the news out on the day off to Donald Trump's victory so out of them have the Democrats learned anything in the past two years\nBut no they haven't but that's not to say that they won't do really well this fall they may well sweep Congress this fall but if they do so it's because of what you know it's for the same reasons that that they always get rescued which is that the Republicans [laughter]\nScrewed up you know that you've got this guy in the oval office who is this unbelievable jerk who has a antagonized so many voters\nSo you know the Democrats have not taken to heart any of the things that you and I\nTalked about so long ago two years ago now\nWhy not do you think 'cause they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see it as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go for a you know the kind of policies at someone like that would put in place but that's not what they're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else\nIs a category mistake that's not who they are\nThey all go in in some of the front of me that they have gone for\nMore left wing candidates in certain places that you had always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so are are they are they shoot sort of a different policy already starting to rise up or it's just I I'm\nI shouldn't I shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are the examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez in I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples and these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to um talk about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine that part on your way and actually\nThe ... yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to um talk about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and\nThat pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that philosophy a it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't that it's short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nTo sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four with only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant\nIn this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people and that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back\nOn that version of themselves beginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition and around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it you posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nYou know remember I had all sorts of ... there that I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he if it's if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThan all bets are off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt guessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty\nYou don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as\nThey need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if the country stays on the track that it's on right now the economy running flat out the accelerator down unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I don't know who can I remember the um period of the Nineteen nineties when you know we
