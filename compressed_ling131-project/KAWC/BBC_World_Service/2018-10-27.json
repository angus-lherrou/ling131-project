World Service with me in golden [noise]\nTime professor of globalization and development at Oxford University\nPreviously I was director of policy of the world bank and before that was CEO of the development bank of southern Africa and was economic advisor to Nelson Mandela when he became president and the country of my book South Africa [noise]\nAnd the previous programs in the series of explode the dramatic consequences of the financial crisis which envelop the world [noise] ten years ago [noise]\nThe crash had a devastating impact on many countries putting millions of people out of work and eroding wages and incomes from which the number of countries are yet to recover [noise]\nThe failure of the world's well paid and powerful authorities an expert at the bank is quoted firms\nCentral banks treasuries and International Monetary fund and yes economists like me to stop the crisis will prevent the result in Europe crisis contributed to collapse in trust this turn politics on its head\nWe cannot say the decision and taken in Nineteen Seventy five by this country and joined the common market has been recessed by this referendum to lean the EU British people have spoken and the answer is where I\nThat's the biggest political shocker in American history the idea that Donald J from a man has never been a politician who never served as a general or the army is the next president of the United states\nEmmanuel Macron will be the next president of France they say the polling projection that we have sixty five point five percent for Emmanuel Macron says four point five percent or Marine Le pen\nI Believe that the election of President Trump and president Macron and the votes for Britain to leave Europe have in common a rejection of the old guard of political leaders that won't juicy when the financial crisis happened\nWithin the rich countries the crisis fuel to power shift towards populist an anti authoritarian politicians and contributed to the rising resentments of elites globally it accelerates at the LBJ shift to China and Asia\nIn this program I'm going to ask whether the lessons from the financial crisis have been loans and where the country's in a better prepared to meet the next one will be condemned to another crisis perhaps even more severe which would provide new fuel to the fines of populism\nIn two thousand age the world was taken by surprise will it be again\nI also Christina God the managing director of the international Monetary Fund which is the global institution responsible for financial stability what worries her most top of the list is the populous politics of protectionism and attempts to wind back the regulations on banks\n\nThe crisis arose because decision makers were blinded by blizzard of information finance is highly dates are intensive industry order to credit rating agencies banks and regulators reduced everything to numbers [noise]\nAs the volume of Trump's actions group and computing power increase [noise] more and more data was being crunched [noise] and economists were able to build the models using ever bigger day to say [noise] and yet relying on the state to prove to be increasing the inadequate decision makers were overwhelmed with information\nAnd unable to disturb what matches from the fire hose of data directed at them [noise]\nAnd political leaders are meant to be paid for the judgment thinking and intuition the evidence shows they relied on badly interpreted big data and groupthink and when the system collapsed they took refuge in blaming others\nBut nevertheless seems amazing to me that so many clever people go to so wrong\nCould it be that the system was captured by short term Muslim politics cronyism and corruption the rating agencies were paid by the banks they rated the older firms relied on the business of clients come\nAnd corruption the rating agencies were paid by the banks they rated the order firms relied on the business of their clients companies many economics faculties dependent on grants from banks the politicians were paid by Wall Street has this changed Jeff sects of Columbia University\nWe are in the United states they pay for play politics through very expensive election campaigns if you want to have your opinion heard you give large funds to the politicians\nAre election cycles are billions and billions of dollars spending on campaigns and now it's the billionaires who dominate this we ended up with a pseudo\nPopulism of the Trump variety which has brought more billionaires into government and more lobbyists into government than we've ever seen in our history it's the most corrupt government we probably ever had\nCompletely the opposite of what the public really wants and what it needs but undertaken in the name of a draining the swamp but actually filling it with the worst or reptiles we have\nA priority for the Trump Administration and bank lobbyists is to roll back the regulations put in place off to the crisis and especially what became known as the dog Frank act his Adam twos also of crashed how a decade of financial crises change the world\nVery few people inside if I get actually operate this I think but it leaves the golfing they'll founded the way to make the American financial system will save\nEveryone understands that Doug Frank is a ... says the office said is may ... difficult the business of running a bank and the United states regulate treat the new the norm is the level of\nLegal wool fat at the bank has to wage to comply with Doug Frank is remarkable that the kind of got saying that the Republicans promised is likely to make the at the mess resilience\nAnd his promise to drain the swamp and get rid of the revolving door between Wall Street here in Washington obviously reverse the points to Goldman Sachs banker\nIsn't that no no I mean the sense that Trump was getting to the mall any fundamental ... uh with the incredibly incest us relationship between American politics and I'm Out in business is clearly just an illusion\nThat is at record highs again and the numerous worrying signs not least the prospect of a trade war and rising nationalism husk allow me was the director general of the world Trade Organization during the crisis\nBe totally Ben's on the amount of education about if that was to be a real way wall or something you just on a wall bans on the wall songs on if\nProductions was to fare up school so then this would have an impact on roast and having an impact on growth would have an impact\nOn production full says I Know to the social impact and it's just you know the classic the impact of a of depression of growth at the time with the world economy was doing reasonably well having a existed that years of conscious\nI also Pasco if he feels a trade war could happen\nThere was a risk of that if you're\nSuffering old miss content is hijacked by pretty decode forces that play it sold a though an analogy kept us all jump on fast or China for us the problems come from a the rest of the world it's a wedding know tendency\nUh we've had a full ages on each bank Rosa there is a scapegoat came to foreign uh protectionism is also seem bleak way of scapegoating that for a non isn't easy temptation so there's a risk no doubt about that\n\nSo symbolic way of scapegoating for enough is an easy temptation so there's a risk no doubt about that\n[noise]\nMuch has changed in the world over the past ten years\nIn some respects the banking sector has been tamed the profitability of the big banks has fallen as has the return on that says [noise] however\nWe're once again seeing the toxic combination of overconfident bank because politicians eager to please versus and lobbyists loose monetary policy\nRising debts and complacent regulators history tells us which is the most common cause of financial crises and precisely the wrong time to weaken bank regulation [noise]\n\nWe should not be allowed into complacency by the strength of global economic growth as this is largely due to high Asian growth rate [noise] the two thousand a crisis stunted because of too much that's\nThe problem has got worse with total exceeding four times the size of the global economy which is a hundred trillion dollars higher than before the last crisis [noise] the u._s._a. and Europe remain highly vulnerable [noise] it used to be said\nThat when the U.S gets a financial cold the rest of the world gets a fever [noise]\nThe rise of Asia has both lifted and stabilize global growth as they are now more growth engines [noise] but as a result of the power shift of the past ten years for all of the five biggest banks in the world are now in China\nCompared to just one of the biggest twenty before the crisis given how important China is now could it be the source of the next financial crisis\nJustin and a leading professor at Peking University brings that these fears are overstated as history has shown China has the ability to prevent crises and manage just domestic that which is guaranteed by the state\nChina so far it's the only country where you now I see the magic crisis in the past forty years\nSo you'd be lucky enough Chuck bakers I think that it's less likely that crash is what you're up in China you bring some corporate that notes that old nominated in China's currency and secondly the corporate that is a high many in that state owned enterprises\nAnd you're not a state owned enterprises\nA guaranteed by the government\nAnd also the ad that used for investment in every effective and that's how they have I said to back no it's kind of that I don't think it's going to be the source of all the crisis and some people predicted [noise]\nI agree with professor Lynn that China is unlikely to be the source of the next crisis [noise]\nMy biggest worry is that the ... crisis has made the rich countries more nationalist undermining cooperation just at a time when risks increasingly ... national borders [noise]\nMeanwhile as a result of the disastrous performance in preventing the financial crisis trust has declined an expert some authorities [noise]\nGet expert advice is needed not only just dumped the next financial crisis but it was to prevent pandemics climate change cyberattacks and other global risk [noise]\nWe need more expertise financial crises are too important to be left to the experts or economists\nCrises impact on all of our lives\nWe need more expertise financial crises are too important to be left to the experts or economists\nCrises impacts on all of our lives in everyone's business\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but sometimes they'll rhythms that we're ... which are clues to the way the future will unfold [noise]\nUnderstand the significance of Christ's [noise]\nFinancial crises have devastating consequences which go far beyond banking [noise]\nOne in many respects the world has recovered economically the political consequences if only recently become shocking evidence in rising extremism and nationalism [noise]\nBy learning from the last crisis my hope is that we can be better informed\nRestore public trust and prevent the next crisis [noise]\nAfter the crash was presented by me in golden and produced by Ben Cox uh MVSA golfing some [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S is made possible by American public media\nNow and then we have a problem where to go on to the most problem it is where the gums\nI understand even the police station was targeted with an explosive devices\nIn about four or five miles to go over there for\nA bomb ... in in the ... on the for quite a law should bomb but we know who these people are always say that it's about to two hundred people and we know them very well it's about ten to twelve different gangs and they\nGo from gangster gang it's very difficult to understand who is with who\nSo it's it's a huge problem to\nAll these people I worked with this young people when they were very small\nSome people have been ... president of America will say other right wing policies have been saying that that's been an increase in crime in Sweden lots and lots of asylum seekers in in in twenty Fifteen and it it's not his thing is\nIt's a difficult question but you're going to say that most of them raised in this environment is coming from other cancers way\nBack in time is not the most recent immigrants that people who came had hops his children or or even the last second generation in the current\n... it's different ethnic it's not only is Marilyn oh about ... is mixed very mixed the normal aged from Seventeen to twenty three\nTo President Trump and others who say the violence is being carried out by asylum seekers who came to Sweden twin Fifteen around\nThe majority of street gang members or from in the ... crimes that researches he's steady gangs of consent to that what shows many either came to Sweden when they're young from places like Somalia Iraq Palestinian territories in the Balkans oh that parents did\nSo want is the violence abound\n... drugs and most of this shooting at all because they are being insulted in a way\nTo take into a girl friends or given the hits and they\nTake the weapon a shoots before they are\nThe bullets in the navy but the last year they are shooting for killing why haven't gone out interested them if you take this two hundred people were about to tell some conviction about this uh people so what kind of ... driving without a license to smaller drug related other than the\nQuite small things to the most of them of course\nBut it's been very hard to get done for the actual shooting for the killing yes convictions that we're getting behind bars\nRight now nobody talks to the police it's very very hard to get people who is telling what they have seen because it's it's suicide notes or environment [noise]\nSee the fact is serious convictions ...\nSwedish government tightened up along come to the ocean to try to tackle that because it's not only melanoma this is happening firearms stuff becoming more common in Sweden as a home in twenty and laugh in Seventeen people were shot that last year there's more than twice that number\nBut combines is nowhere near the levels seen in the United states we're close to the team\nThere's more than twice that number ... ... is nowhere near the levels seen in the United states we're close to the teen thousand people die from ... in a year\nBut it's alarming people in Sweden we're more used to that country being held up as a kind of Scandinavian social and democratic paradise\nThe problem with Sweet Honey than I think you might like to powder realities that see them as a country's doing very well you know if you look on all the global rankings so even among the top countries but the challenges that we also have a dark reality\nThis is a natural stung me he's both a sociologist and police officer very Swedish combination\nThese bugs are trying to a dream and maybe one of the reasons that made me survive either a goal of becoming a police officer\nAnd there is some cells and immigrant suddenly came to Sweden for around when he was a boy and he grew up learning how to handle himself\nYou know the ... that I was raised up yeah yeah of course people by us and its Weiner's today also ablaze when I was raising a bowl of people in those areas do this all the conflict with guns\nAnd this has crime isn't actually going up in Sweden it's more that it's intensifying in parts of the three biggest cities still come back on Mount ...\nOur problem have not been increasing but our problem are now becoming more and more concentrated in certain areas certain streets and certain population so if you look at for example the homicide rate in Sweden you know the top ... highest rate of homicide was I think Ninety eighty eight\nAnd we were you know two million or twenty percent less population than that we are today\n... characters who speaks up our crime or a serious crime has been changing from you know be previously was quite even distribute ... main name a knife related today is gun related to names is linked to mourn two gangs\nSay well it's causing this new intensifying violence as we were to discover it's a notch Paul the existence of those two realities that are creating the problem Sweden's prosperous country to most people it's very safe place to live with lots of opportunities\nBut not everyone especially not foreigners to come with little money has access to that lifestyle [noise]\nA Fifteen minute drive from the center of mama that the housing estate called Rosen code it's so big it feels like an entirely separate town a Jew cabbage why mess Leslie cuts it's an off those in the seventies it's not a popular place to live [noise]\nIs there a segregated [noise] there what do you mean like there was a there are lots of people are without work well a lot of people that have haven't went to school ... cigarettes in a community worker showed me around and a lot of social welfare takers or to call it ...\nRecipients people don't benefit a lot of immigrants I lost all of a suite of people that have been on social welfare for generations\nSome media reports say it's become so disaffected and tripled a place that it's effectively a no go ahead and\nTalk not trade we were walking around quite freely inside secret who works for an end GMO free Seuss it which runs social projects the young people and tries to help them lead gangs seems to be on friendly terms with all the states\n\n\nAll the states\n\nIs getting married yeah\nUm and how how do you know these guys working with the\nDog was helping him to to get a job and study and he's working now\nAnd the surveys suggested that more than half the students in areas like red and gold just as vulnerable by the government leave school at Fifteen with no qualifications\nBut don't take care of young people jumping out of school like we should\nWe can see it really only\nThe young people that we're getting from all of us ah\nWe don't do anything about it we will come of dozens of apartment blocks were told sometimes as many as Fifteen people live in a flat not full of ... children play areas I'm In a nearby sports home without talking to a young man I met\nGive me\nA slight Eighteen year old with waving Donna Karan ... open face he's presumably tough and then he looks nice getting ready for boxing training he doesn't live on the state but he used to\nThe time I Lived here it was very safe and very normal childhood where we went out to play but then after a time it changed\nWe started the drugs we started the criminals and that's how it is today when did it change do you think you know people became teams and they didn't really\nHave a good time at school some drop early\nThey feel left out so they want to feel accepted and so they go to find smaller groups and slum places you know and and it's all drugs and\nCrime you know do you know anyone friends old friend who've got involved in gangs and that's why they had a friend that started doing that stuff and he was telling me I Know I Will get shot soon and that is feeling is very terrible to live with that\nOh I see it as a trap and you need to move out so I moved out a early age for white wine to Trump will the people here on earth can basically say they will become zombies later they will they will be addicted to drugs they will not be the same friends you had\nShow the hungry young men are a problem in many cities in many countries the added extra in Sweden is that ready access to guns\nThey kill them for it to southern it's a norm or what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World
