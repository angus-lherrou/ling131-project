anything\nBasically what's happening in the\nBut we're devoting this ... to ... to ... she's of local activist against so cool honor killings in Pakistan or fight comes from a very personal and painful place which will hear about later\nI'll either was born in a small rural village in ... in southwest Pakistan many girls there were denied an education when a leader was growing up but her father took the unusual step of moving the family to different cities so she and her sister could go to school\nLeaders bond with her dad was very close\nOne of the things that I remember it clearly is that he would put the on his shoulders and he would walk around the village and he would show many different things every time a different route and we would go around the streets me holding on to his hair and my feet kicking his shoulders and he would be very proud of telling me about the world\nWhile everyone stared\nI have to say even at like two or three years of age I knew that people were watching us and they were shocked at how\nNot his son by his daughter was on his shoulders and\nBy that he meant to show me where my place was in the world the way up higher than everything else\nSo his expectations have you with perhaps a little bit different too they're pushing the most fathers ...\nThey were very much he knew he saw the potential enemy way before I did\nAnd most of the girls there was a knowledge among schools and they would be getting married in ... and young as well as you talk about about together\nMy sisters and I would go back to the village and see that two or three or four cousins girls have been married off without even knowing\nIt's mostly because decisions like that are made behind closed doors and especially by their fathers but the other thing was that they knew that when they accept a marriage like that they're honoring their fathers so it was very much in bills in our mindset when\nSomeone comes up to you and says hey your father has decided to give you to this person in marriage even if you're nine years old you would say yes father because that makes him a very dignified men in this society and hence it fills our hearts that joy\nAnd so I walked through the door and he was on a stool and fixing a fan on the ceiling for the children the children were beside him looking up at him and yelling at him for not being careful I just kept looking at my uncle because this was a man who everyone was scared of\nSlowly through the tears of the children slowly seeing what he had done to them he had evolved into a man who had fully submitted himself to these children he had learned to love\nAnd these children were in love with him as well I kept telling myself that I I have forgiven him but I have to say my heart never really agreed\nBut that changed in twenty four to ... when a leader uncle was dying of terminal comes to a tree joined her family others but\nBecause this was a man who everyone was scared of\nSlowly through the tears of the children slowly seeing what he had done to them he had evolved into a man who had fully submitted himself to these children he had learned to love\nAnd these children were in love with him as well I kept telling myself that I I have forgiven him but I have to say my heart never really agreed\nBut that changed and twenty fourteen when\nLeaders uncle was dying of terminal comes to a tree joined her family at his bedside when a leader walked into the room he had a strange reaction\nHe look towards the door in his eyes became wide\nAnd he said look how'd you always hear and that is the nickname the all called ... and ...\nImmediately everyone in the house looked at me and looked back at him and they realized that he was actually seeing through me to someone who was standing behind me and that is one for the first time I realized that for the job was always always with me\nBut it also let me see my uncle that the fear in his eyes that the whole time that I was in that house he kept looking at me and believing that I was cut each other\nAnd it was very very devastating for me to see and I was like I I forgive you said it in my heart and that is when I knew I forgave him but because of that I became much stronger and much more powerful and my work\nI mean some people will still don't really understand how you can forgive this mom I mean do you understand how they think of is\nYes I knew that I'm a former cell phone mine would be very very much dislike my decision and would challenge me for why I'm forgiving him\nBut I learned that forgiveness is not for him it was never for him whoever forgave him or anyone else they forgave them for themselves\nThe moment I did it I learned that it was because I wanted to be free of that bird and I wanted to be free to be more powerful\nAnd the moment my heart agreed that I have for a given him I turned into that one powerful woman that I wanted to be from all these years and really challenge things like that\nNow on on the positive side ... object can you move around the world and they've also\nThe June to reach the love life [laughter] tell me about this [noise]\nI see how to better [laughter]\nHonestly I never really thought that I Would ever fall in love even though I was fighting against honor killings a deep down the same custom had\nTaken root in my heart and whenever the mention of love would come my heart would be in a way that made me feel like it's not something that I desire so my whole goal was always to just continue on with my work\nBut when you first realize that you were in love with the reduced in American [laughter] huge didn't initially think oh let's let's just get married and have a real good [laughter]\nSo\nMeeting David and being extremely impressed by him and he feeling the same way\nI saw my father and honestly I I remember being like I Can't believe what I've done to him\nI Can't believe from all those years he gave me everything when I started trying he told me I was going to be an artist when I started writing he told me I was going to be a writer he kept telling me what potential I had\nWhat kind of leader I Would be but I had turned into that leader and given him all of these illnesses and all of that\nEating David and being extremely impressed by him and he feeling the same way\nI saw my father and honestly I I remember being like I Can't believe what I've done to him\nI Can't believe all those years he gave me everything when I started trying he told me I was going to be an artist when I started writing he told me I was going to be a writer he kept telling me what potential I had what kind of leader I Would be but I had turned into that leader and given him all of these\nIllnesses and all of the heartache so I said that I Would do everything that makes you happy\nAnd so in that time I actually decided to marry I was about twenty four years old\nAnd by that time I should be a grandmother and my village [laughter]\nSo I met someone and I decided that I Would marry that man and fully intended on doing that and I introduced him to my father as well\nAnd turns out while I'm fully planning the date of the marriage and writing down in my journal about the details of the wedding and everything and how we would live our life my father comes back to me and he says but he does not like the guy\nDidn't like a a nice ... that you would be ideally suited for ...\n[laughter]\nMy father just likes to keep surprising me and keep giving me all of this heartache why like do the same for him he said that he's going to steal your light\nHe's going to take away your positivity and I looked at my father that is when he fully opened up to me he told me something that he'd never ever mentioned we were actually away from the family we were walking in a park so that none of my other siblings here and he told me a story that\nReally changed my thinking about him\nHe told me that when he was seven years old when he had just started going to school and he had started discovering the love for his education\nHe would walk to two villages from his village and go to that one school that was really far from him one morning he was walking to that village where his school was when there was called on the street just like a village life where everything is normal even buy everything look chaotic\nAnd he was walking through the streets when he saw a big group of men standing in a corner and looking at something on the ground and his voyage curiosity had him he wanted to see what everybody was looking at and so he struggled to push everybody aside and go through that crowd it was a big crowd\nFinally he though pushed the last person that was in front of him and he regretted doing that because right in front of him on the ground was a man and a woman all bloodied beaten to death\nAnd he cannot take this away from his memory his heart was beating so fast and he clutched his books again and went back to the street and went to his school\nUnable to take this image out of his mind in his claws when he reached all the boys were laughing and playing and throwing things at each other and he just sat there remembering that image of what he had just seen\nFinally Iran forty to fifty minutes later the teacher walks in and he immediately went to the chalk board and took the chalk and he's like okay boys all take out your books today we're going to read this chapter and he turned towards the students and my father saw that his front of his shirt was full of splash herds of blood [noise]\nLater he found out that he was the one who took steak and beat\nThing and playing and throwing things at each other and he just sat there remembering that image of what he had just seen\nFinally around forty to fifty minutes later the teacher walks in and he immediately went to the chalk board and took the chalk and he's like okay boys all take out your books today the are going to read this chapter and he turned towards the students and my father saw that his front of his shirt was full of splattered of blood\nLater he found out that he was the one who took steak and beat his nice to death and he was part of the murders but he had seen on the street and he had come back\nAfter that to educate all of them they had given him this one feeling afraid that he had carried with him all of his life\nFrom the moment that he put me on his shoulders to this moment for he fought for me to uh to not to put my life in risky actually in his heart desires for me to keep doing it every time I fought with him he desired that I should fight harder with him to keep my fight\nSo hungry to talk to her father about the money she really wanted to marry David\nAn accepted it however bringing both of their families together was a bit tricky\nInterestingly his family is extremely sweet and my family is it's extremely sweet but then my family started saying some very mean things about his mother\nAnd his mother started saying some really mean things about my family and they were sitting on two different sides of the world and saying all these things without even seeing each other down to being a photo of each other\nThey just knew that this can happen this marriage can tap and for what reason both families didn't know why\nAnd two thousand fourteen I had a talk in Italy Venice\nAnd I decided that I'm going to bring my family there and ask David to bring his family we're going to have them meet each other\nAnd they can say all the mean things they wanted to say that in front of each other [laughter] so when they all came to Italy one night before that'd be canceled their hotel rooms and booked a small area being be\nAnd put them in that place as soon as they arrived and started on our most awkward it's time for life\nThis one week they spend they were sitting right next to each other and they had been saying extremely\nFearful and harsh things for each other in their homes now everyone was silent and so slowly\nConversation started and all of those conversations I have to say started over ... that my mom made\nAnd within three days of this meeting they actually started realizing that oh my God we're all human stay there so many similarities than there are differences and that is where we got engaged in Venice, Italy and soon our wedding was planned\nIt sounds like a scene from Hollywood rom coms function [laughter]\n\n... to ... I Hope books cooled I should have on a there's a photo of her on a website and one of the dumps forget you can touch with anything you might have missed an oil says it's going to the outlook put cost so stay tuned we'll be back in a moment\nAnd then they ... they love the the they were ... smiling and they there was so happy about this character that you know we have someone who is the person I think the greatest comedian so they were all laughing and I'm at the end of the show I I said this is a ...\nI was watching them and I realized how they're smiling so the laughter subsided\nAnd are are they\nAnd I said come on let's watch someone who is imitating or impersonating Charlie Chaplin\nAnd that they ... they loved it they they were ... smiling and they there was so happy about this character that you know we have someone who is in first and I think the greatest comedian so they were all laughing and I'm at the end of the show I I say this is\nA ...\nI was watching them and I realized how they're smiling so the laughter subsided and are are they will not angry and then they obviously had to think about it and and then they have been supporting me ever since\nWhat a billion way to to to let them know that you are being Chaplin but to not tell them I just let them watch a video of you that's a that's a fantastic way of doing it so then you started performing obviously to to audiences how did they react\nBy the time that I don't think we do my ... and I know there is\nA um a festival or and ... every year um mid March when farmers mostly a guy that from all over the country and the exchange alone and\nPeople buy loans to take them home so the performance was called um have you had to have on the kind to nature I Do the performance people a war we're calling different names like jump bleach Appalachian apply or\nThings like you know the who's similar to Charlie Chaplin because a lot of them were farmers and it will not\nProbably heard about Charlie Chaplin maybe saw a glimpse of his character somewhere or but overall the a reaction was extraordinary\nWhen the performance and that people rushed into the stage and trying to take a photo and then I had people saying Charlie Chaplin died many years ago how what's happening here how is you know he was a ... or something or\nDuring the rush when the audience came on stage there was something that people have too risky me from under people's ah feet\nWhich is a really could be itself as seen from a chaplain movie however not everyone has been so receptive to ... performances he's been the target of online falling because he ...\nAs some of the the message is really been a insulting and abusive\nThings like you have a lift your religion or what are you doing you cannot be Charlie Chaplin so from different groups and different types of reactions of been receiving but then that has not deterred my determination\nYou mentioned how you know you're getting negative feedback on social media sometimes and I sometimes get threats are you ever SCAD performing live after all we are talking about a country that when a performing arts and music were outlawed under the Taliban for quite some time I I actually ever skated during a performance\nThat's that that's I'm ...

welcome to us if you're just tuning in sixteen Seventeen twenty seven excuse me in the London newsroom that you would have seen the named Charles ... you would have heard as well on the ... over the

on the ... has seen treating he said he embodied the strength of life in front of more than in the face of all in his fortune him body\nIn the universe so I mentioned to another news I don't want\nYet it wasn't random decision although I Want to make a provocative thing I didn't think that my feet so provoking it I thought that the fact that I gather those different girls together was provoke it but it turned out that my vowels even more\nFocused because the girls that are in your video they all different types of clothing some that's more conservative and some of the considered religious or did you and says you have a bright purple ... with a Black Jack is kind of a blazer\nOver is um how did it feel though I mean you're getting filmed you're wearing a bra with the jak is what it feels like\nIt's so good I mean I had my friends around me while shooting video and um I don't know it felt was near the lake so yes\nIs it something you would ever ...\nOut you know for a being around the lake or on the beach yes\nRice and is that because you were surrounded by women if there was a mine around maybe their ... and the crew I have no idea does not make a difference\nFor me that her legs as far as I had I mean I had boys she'll fair but for a lot of the girls my country I think it does makes different\n... that that's what I'm trying to get a really ... it's like culturally when you wear certain items of clothing you said you wanted to be provocative definitely provoked a reaction did you expect this much attention\nActually ideally I thought I was only be dreaming about this much of reaction but I was planning to have caught were at least a target than driving people now that I got even more viral that I thought it wants to be I think I over reached like OK\nOkay I understand can you tell our listeners a little off what people have said to you on both sides\nWell I said that there are a lot of people who support me and I was really surprised by the amount of people who support me but on the other hand I think they're even more people than not support me\nAnd I've been getting a lot of common people I just got like by the\nEnd of the things the way\nI don't know I think writing a lot of hatred it's a common and stuff like that and they'll do I got some best friends\nI'm just going to repeat that because it's a phone line it's not clear ... death threats against you because of this\nI got death threats too so I can say that I was ready for any kind of reaction because I prepared myself psychologically before released video but it turns out that handling these that threat is not that easy as it is in theory\nWhat does it mean in practice\nReally difficult finding a balance between like\nAnd they'll do I got some test for it\nI'm just going to repeat them because of the phone line it's not clear and you got death threats against you because of this\nI got death threats too so I can say that I was ready for any kind of reaction because I prepared myself psychologically before released a video but it turned out that handling these that threat is not that easy as it is in theory though\nWhat does it mean in practice\nIt's really difficult finding a balance between like the feeling that everything's going to be All right not that he's going to happen and the feeling that like any way you should be careful not finding that balance influence sometimes if\nSometimes I get paranoid because like when people watch me in the streets I'm like I'm getting mixed feeling you know of being safe\nBut then like worrying that something will happen\nYes so I think our listeners could understand the particularly am if they've seen the video on line and so many people that were so angry about is how has it changed your day to day life you do walking down the street sounds like are you going into town are you do still feel free\nSkin I Am going into town I can walk in the ... the thing is that I cannot do that alone right\nBecause uh yeah I I I Need to have a person beside me a whole will support and who will help a case something happens it's yeah weird\nHave you gone to the ... about this police officers about these threats\nYes yes I have reported those people who have as many death threats and um I think for me it's now it's even does that\nTell our listeners why he wanted to make this video the message that you're trying to get across\nWell the thing is that in my country officially everyone\nHas similar right so it doesn't matter what whether you're a woman or a match but I'm just seeing the flop on is involved mentality of people because there are a lot of\nStandards that we mean only two states so I think those those kind of standards and I'm just screaming nation on gender basis and um those extremely hot at least six\nStories for example we have won it's\nLet's say tradition but now it's actually it's not a tradition it's well it's not legal it's called right kidnapping it's when men in jeans\nA kidnap ... months and um they bring parts of the man's house and it together it was all around with their friends they make for state in that house as the ... for that meant it also include\nIn a lot of cases psychological pressure and also sexual harassment I Would say so I think that that the existence of the fact that that that didn't exist in my country and they have those states today is\nThat it's all about the video and I'm seeing the idea that I wanted to deliver that uh we should not judge anyone buy a book or the things they do a or the choices that they may\nNot setting\nThe video better is one of the most watchman threads on our website on our news I was saying that she reminds me of Madonna and when she wore them from provocative that was the Nineteen

choices that they made\nThat Saturday and video about her as one of the most watched month's rent on our website on our news I I I was saying is that she reminds me of Madonna on Smith on her when she wore that problem so provocative I was admitted Nineteen eighties\nAs Aaron said she had heard of Madonna but I've never heard any offered songs but then you know she's only Nineteen\nSo women on that did that it was almost two lifetimes away for her [noise] um we don't get to hear from my colleague can go now to ... a journalist with the BBC couldn't get service on the reach of the story

President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to explored American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nI come from like two scoops of ice cream we understand but will the Canadians like this part of the deal Jessica [noise]\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less though or Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team not including increasing the slice of the

will the Canadians like this part of the deal Jessica [noise]\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less so for Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team that including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all\nHappy about it they're saying that really this is putting their their future the future of their families at risk especially since ... this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to it during market as part of a trade deal notably with the recent see to deal with the European Union\nNow this could spell some trouble for Trudeau in the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec where there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what to do is saying today is look at first off the U.S we're really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also promising for compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some of the sting out of this confession\nAnd what about the personal relationship there's been some pretty frosty times between the leaders of town there in the United states in recent months but the rules sounding quite warm today well sure assessment\nTesty I think is the word a U.S president Donald Trump used today describing\nSome of the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair\nI think it was the most heated around you and around the G ... meeting and get back where true came out saying that Canada would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade a Trump came out calling him Mika mild weak and and that really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came to trade\nNow at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like a bit of a platitudes but\nThe Canada and us relationship has weathered a lot of storms between its leaders leaders have not always gotten along\nAnd I think that that title do go deeper than than sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica Murphy in Toronto thanks very much
