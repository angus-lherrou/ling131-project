appearance in the alert she has been found safe and well\nMine is in custody but money can damned theater is racist on the force has since apologized for what does the word mean and why is it offensive exactly professor at Tanya Hernandez has written a book on civil rights and people of mixed race and I asked her how she described the word\nThe word is both historically derogatory meaning and also a very neutral descriptive meaning\nAt the term is ... is derived from our a slave holding history\nAnd it refers to people who are mixed race or white with African ancestry um and now it's become sort of more general usage of just referred to mix trace of any sort of but it's a historical entity concerned black and white mixture\nA I Would think more than a historical context which it seems strange to me that a police force would use it as\nWell you know it's very odd about the word is that while they come from this slavery period and a way to describe mixed race people\nLeave

it's very odd about the word is that\nWhile they come from this slavery period and a way to describe mixed race people both historically even on senses are taking over the years and the seventeenth Eighteenth century um but\nToday we have a sort of a resurgence with our communities we're talking about moving to pry a and so it's now in our public discourse in a way\nThat it hasn't been in the past\nAnd I think perhaps my there will be that the police force was sort of on consciously responding to that new way of talking about lotto mixed race multi racial biracial at all these terms that are floating out there in the ether\nAnd it might be professor because I'm just seeing here from the statement from the Edmonton fleece a re Akbar with the inspector there he said the controversial word was what would you find a close peers off the victim who witness the alleged abduction\nAnd that's the thing while a prior generations would have thought in the English speaking words if you are speaking World Series or a clear that mulatto is derogatory\nYounger generation sort of are we appropriating it as part of their mixed race pride and certainly in a Spanish speaking world that term it never becomes to be but it's true story\nIt's always it's problematic but in a different time problematic in the way that will ... is a referred to as a way to describe the greater superiority of individuals who have some white next in their mixture\nUm and that's the ... that it would be better than just being or sort of a pie or model of racial a black African\nSuch problematic but it is different got away and I understand and you are white Cuban I'm black Puerto Rican um as anybody ever use the words to you only as a way to try to compliment me\nRelated in an odd way but yes um and also as a way to dissuade me from identifying with blackness huh I'll be told oh why do you say I for Puerto Rican why do you say that you just normally make sure we're not that\nAh and it's a way for people to think that they're complementing the by saying that you know they want to raise that more my white profile than the African ancestry and my mixture and the person who says not their ethnicity\nWhere they run the gamut in Latin America these kinds of thoughts are very ingrained in our race the biology and so it can come from people who are black identified dark in themselves and

dump Eduardo ... back in twenty eleven baby sees Lucy Williamson has been covering his trial in Madrid and she told me more about the court's decision\nWell it was a strange kind of voting today I'm at what is that it was found to have taken in as much as they got from her mother straight off to help us in Nineteen sixty nine he was found to have foolish to help us to forget and was found to have given her to another couple as a gift\nBut the court also decided that too much time had pause to actually convict him to the statute of limitations in this case only extend it to ten years off to the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now so to that or walked free\nWe spoke to in his off to the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the truth had been officially established him I think there'll be a and within ... when the one that I feel\nGood because the Spanish court has said yes maybe have been done in Spain\nAnd said that mother wasn't lying she we told the truth I don't mind that he's not going to jail it's not the most important thing because he can't leave his house people will recognize him and everyone knows who the gate\nAnd he's condemned anyway now the second phase stop getting to the Supreme code and let's see what they decide on the statute of limitations\nReaction there in his mouth or the gal Lacey one woman one snatched baby them one doctor in this case but this has always thought too much much wider ... is the reaction been women around the country of have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one dogs and one woman who he helps deliver forty nine years ago but it's been walks across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting in his his history this is about\nOpening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's past at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on fit to raise that children\nBetween one dogs and one woman who he helps deliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting in his his history this is about opening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's pasta at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on fit to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years just because they were on marriage or seen the judge to pool\nLater on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties complain and say St ... became a master of trafficking the children for money\nBut this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside court today waiting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that because I had walked free free without any punishment one described as a slap in the face\nBut there were others that were happy the state had knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as whose baby was taken away by a nun in Nineteen Seventy four before pilot could even gave her firstborn child a name she told me or even learn it's gender\nImmediately off the bus she said she was injected with a drug that left to unconscious the following day ... the baby had died\nWhen pound demanded to know what happened the doctor said it was an active goats when she also the the ... she was told it had already been married forty four years later talking to us she still cries episodes of the child she never got a chance to hold\nOut on you know but when I got a time if you're going to get thrown around\nOn the day he had to stay I write to them I say you and nine months in my belly on the left changed the fight ... by their I've let you address in which the child but I was from the time he says it into the tendons heal\nLots Paulos story a Lucy or just one case will it be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what Spain Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials abroad in the future that have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case\nI mean it up to the vet himself is believed to has destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried on and of course many of those involved and now very elderly\nAnd innocence adopted mother in fact confessed the situation to her before she died but because because she was handed and it says a baby a mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... is the man who can tell how but despite this landmark trial in his is still closer to finding out who ... mother is or even if she said alive\nNow was Lucy Williamson in Madrid that on that verdict in the case of the stolen babies as a lot more

full BBC News out of cost cutting more to come on this edition of the program back to Frank in Brazil and we'll be considering the new un climate change report\nSo well is only PCC reports have any impact in the United States I've been speaking to Gina McCarthy the former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency she was the lead on President Obama's climate change policies\nIn the United states at least people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public understands that\nThe real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as far away problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines are maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California or in the west\nBut frankly you know climate change changes everything it really is the biggest threat that we have to public health today to our safety you know to uh wellbeing to our economy's to jobs this is about national security as well and people need to understand and personalize it\nAnd if you look in America it's not monolithic picture is that as you say the the White House the current administration so he takes a different views the administration usa but if you're looking at Twenty one state say they're still signed up to the Paris or agreements many cities many local ministry rations\nBought without central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell ya I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down than not following the science and not following the law they are trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's a longer term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't a short term problem\nThis is it this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today\nWhich is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector but it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about it is now his job's has been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line\nBut this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change that carbon footprint is the type of call they drive Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult to get America change that habit\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car company\nIn the United states and it continues to move at a pace that faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line but this administration doesn't understand about the jobs of the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change that carbon footprint is the type of call they drive Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult to get America change that habit\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicle that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued then we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking year they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consuming money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pump\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today and addressing the challenge of climate change for all of us to\nTalk about saving lives look at some of the the extreme weather the America seems to be having to to deal with more and more I mean is that having an impact do you think on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter and instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities\nLet's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't steal mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we have never had them before or the drought we're facing let's talk about the opportunities we have to lift everybody up\nAnd move to a future that's better for everyone\nI feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running towards an this report\nWould it make any difference to the conversation in the United states do you think or just to be seen as another most of the same that washes over people's heads I don't\nThink people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid MRI to what the opportunities of future can be\nAnd that was Gina McCarthy
