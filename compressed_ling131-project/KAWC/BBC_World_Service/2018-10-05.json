candidate giant ... he's seen by many as someone who can clean up politics but there's also a very controversial figure a BBC Brazil's Costa explains\nLabels on NATO has been called Brazil's Trump before he is a far right politician he comes from a career in the military any started out being a member of the Congress and sort of defending military interests over time though issues he talked the most about became\nMore and more conservative so he has been the center of a number of controversies regarding minority rights regarding algae beauty rights women's rights he claims for example that executives shouldn't really\nHave to pay the same amount to women and men\nFor the same job because women get pregnant you said before that if he had a gay son he would rather that this son died in an accident because he wouldn't really know how to deal with that\nHe has said as well that a congresswoman ... you\nWouldn't be raped because she was too ugly so you can see how some of those phrases have caused controversy in Brazil there was a women's march protest march or all of the country uh last weekend I mean how significant with those marches\nThose marches were very significant they were actually the largest protest ever organized by women in Brazil\nSo it was quite colorful you had a lot of heterosexual women trends women algae Beatty cues some men as well they were saying a known which is the hash tag in Portuguese for not ham or never him ...\nSo much so that people are actually using it for sort of real settling relationship disputes\nYeah the ... the guy who is doing this test that photograph man she was saying that basically you can get at seven in the morning here they had some calls\nFrom couples and they're asking him how soon they can come to get the lie detector test because they are getting into on their way to sort of the situation is just to take this test\nShe said the story that's mostly a man it's a going out to five AM than if I Am he gets home and he has an argument with his wife or thoughts now\nAnd then after sick from six to seven AM they're trying to find an Internet that photograph office and at seven o'clock they give us a call to the photograph men [noise]\nNow you decided to put the lie detector to the test yourself yeah\nYes I thought it's quite interesting experience for me as a journalist and I wanted to show the audience how this test works\nTo I'm looking at this picture of you in a chair and you've got something is you've got some kind of harness on ah in your ... and above your chest and then your fingers on some kind of post Rita ... what's that\nNow there is a sensors though those are things that chicken ... breeds and how do I spent and how does my heart work what kind of\nQuestions do they ask in the first place to get to know whether you're telling the truth or lying\nIn the first day they're asking the question then all the ride ons for\nThey ask me your name is all and I said no because it's true and they said um that's a screen how do Iraq when I'm saying truth because he knows for sure that I Am central is and then that would line because men the oxygen name ... and I said no they saw a how to Iraq\nAnd it was quite interesting because in the end he said that I'm a perfect ... for them because they can like clear and they see what I'm saying truth and when I'm lying so we didn't just the first\nRussian than all the ride ons for they asked me your name is all and I said no because it's true and they said um that's a screen how to Iraq when I'm saying truth because he knows for sure that I'm central is\nAnd then I Would line because men they oxygen name ... and I said no they saw a how to Iraq\nAnd it was quite interesting because in the end he said that I'm a first supplier for them because they can they clear and they see what I'm saying truth and when I'm lying\nSo we didn't just the first part of test my goal was just to show how this test works it would not go to an oath to understand what is my he didn't secrets or or did they have in my past because they just wanted because he didn't take long any hidden secrets of what you have in your [laughter]\nWell maybe [laughter] but it will not go oh we just wanted to show how this works but still even though I I knew that there is no consequences from me saying truth ally and still I was very nervous I don't know why that says quite a lot though doesn't it even though there were no consequences for you\nThe test would somehow stressing you outta\nYes it's really stress you out because they put you in a room you haven't seen before they put in some wires and you really took me ... minutes to keep calm what would your conclusion then\nI think he can really ... if you know the specialist it as a professional person who has an experience who knows what he or she is doing in the end I saw clearly that screen where I was lying and were I Would say in truth yeah my experience was very good I mean that\nI really think that's going to grow for suicide detector test works or if you don't mind a few sheriff\nDo share an apartment to share a flat with anyone uh yes I Do do\nYou ever have disagreements over who took the milk or use the last of the show girl with the tea without replacing it no we don't have any arguments or oh that's beautiful and [laughter] just chilling that's beautiful so you never need to take your living upon it to a lie detector test no no\nAnd I think that people really desperate people really in a big big trouble that's why they are getting accused almost the slide detector test so if you're taking your personal relationship to lie detector tests then it's probably already over yes I think so and I think just couples they had to break up like\nIn the second they decided to take the lie detector that they have to break up immediately and you had that from a ... do not she records for BBC\nUkrainian from kiss\nOn a ...

do get very rural sometimes I mean we had to do to limit the effects leader in June this year saying at a at a rally that\nA majority of Indians in South Africa or racist he was being very very polemic all about it what did you have an opportunity to address that at that statement to address that issue\nYes I mean this statement has become very very alone in a among the Indian community it's made them a little bit scared the Indian community people told me that they often here are supporters of a a millennial saying that you know go back to your country hundred and fifty years now\nAnd the Indian community also complained of racism but Partridge allegedly by the black people against them\nThey get giving examples of an incident which happened in Nineteen eighty five\nAnd English or they've got to the buildings were burned down by the local black African people\nIn the [laughter] and I felt as it was a very complex issue of race relations in South Africa is complex it's not that easy to blame somebody or one community oh you are racist or not I think all these major three communities that have their own problems\nAnd they have complaints against each other and I think truth lies somewhere in between\nAnd that's too bad I'm at a BBC Hindi talking about his recent trip to South Africa this as the fifth floor debates hometown is in India is be hot state by the way way is the laws\nAnd can you take that in this episode of that theory is my home town ... takes us to the place she grow up in in western Kenya my home town\nI think all these music through communities there

is the fifth floor debates hometown is in India's ... state by the way way is yours\nAnd can you take is that in this episode of our series my hometown bedroom local or BBC slated takes us to the

twelve would\nBe packaged in small pox and don't be sold for\nFive ... which is about to sleep patterns for us it which was a big treat for us because I actually was a lot of money back then and what she bought for H was actually a very very nice deal so we did after that\nMy ideal weekend in my home town would be going for seeming [noise]\nMe thinking now sending out because the weather is most of the AIDS they nice and sunny\nAnd also would also blood for oil and how much how much is basically it's a ... it's basically roast meat but there's a way that they can do that is so nice so most of the time would be taken for\nSwimming and then there have to go for mushroom and chips or a town is known for many things one is a food\nThe community that leaves at its core Kyle engine so they have

and then around the stick inside the ... than it has a very nice taste I Can't describe it and then and the second thing is known for is as or if you look on the whole most champions the reason why it's called ... that is most of the athletes\nMost up quite a number of athletes marathon runners and those are the long distance runners have come from out of the rent for the training as or it that's why it's called the home of champions\nWhen I think of my home town I think of when\nI read and I was a preteen Sunday and who and Edwards has really green my home is full of fruit trees and

cover it cricket match and then the thinking about lessons in these recent experience for ... he's an Afghan journalists with BBC\nPashto and was in Northern Ireland to cover a series of game between Afghanistan and the republic of island this came from a creepy guy and in dairy also known as London Denny I rent\nOne of the ...\n... taking us to home town out there I think you barrel now back on the reporting beat you go to cover a cricket match and then that thinking about lessons in peace recent experience for any actual ... he's an Afghan journalists with the D.C\n... and was in Northern Ireland to kind of a series of game between Afghanistan and I because I learned this came from a cricket kind and Danny also known as London Danny\nI went there to cover the crickets cities there were building matches up between the two sides to play a one on one end but the third one was affected by it in and it was they went and it was very interesting experience not only about cricket I'm personally a fan of cricket\nI played when I was it a few gee in Pakistan we learned cricket there\nI also enjoyed the atmosphere of Lyndon ... how much did you know about Northern Ireland before you went\nAs a journalist and we work on this subject a lot about the trouble is started in the late sixties boom bang hair they're fighting killing thousands of people were killed injured then Good Friday demand\nBut when I went to London dating\nI spoke with people my can sit or thinking well that that a lot of people miss two on two separate itself from a British Rule I gave their talking with people there there are some people who are nationalist who may want to join the republic of Ireland\nBut with the young people I spoke a majority of them didn't have that type of\nThinking that they should leave a United Kingdom or ... it's a generational thing I was told that those who are older and they might thanks daily or mission and that\nMust still out there might be young people who are influenced by their parents or they have to go to the you were asking people these questions will formally audience in mind though is it just a formula for my information and I was thinking also to have some sort of reports about peace agreement in Northern Ireland and how it will be\nAdequate gated in our country\nI think if someone goes there the fall or they were in the middle of the city\nIt was the why did nobody could cross one side and that and now they are living in a peaceful light up enjoying it and I want is done it could give it a good example and I would hope one day and I want to start unfortunately\nAre in the young generation they are following the steps of those who fought for nothing\nAnd pass for two years killing pictures are coming out of of honest on state of civil and killed\nAnyone who is good for us they are humans so\nContinuation of war is not in the benefit of any went in there should be allies in Northern Ireland though we cannot compare the situation and I wanted some of the fighting for what it's done with the Northern Ireland because I Want to stop them like a little bit of complex but still when peace talk it is a good example\nI mean did you find that the experiences no line that you know such as this conflict which wasn't resolved through military means in the end it's a good message Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland and those who would the armed groups had political ... those political wings became political parties today\nDo you think that's something that Afghanistan could lead from and the chief they should learn they should learn it\nAnd we have for example if you take the case of Taliban ... has a political office in ... so they should be given if you want peace they should be given as a political wing of the Taliban but it takes compromise yeah\nThis conflict which wasn't resolved through military means in the end it's a good message Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland and those who would the armed groups had political wings and those political wings became political parties today do you think that's something that Afghanistan could lead from an achieve their should learn it they should learn\nIt and we have for example if you take the case of probably about ... has a political office in ...\nSo they should be given if you want peace they should be given as a political wing of the Taliban but it takes compromise yeah if you want peace you have to compromise what did you find in Northern Ireland put signs of compromise would you say you found this name of London daddy some people are calling it daily somewhat not they will not taking it serious\nA London dairy being the name that the union is coated and dairy being the name that the Republicans would call it\nIf you looked into the history there were two main groups Eunice who wanted to be part of the Britain and there was a national tour manly Catholics they wanted to join the republic of Ireland\nThe compromise you are for example the city officially is Lyndon daily but airport is called daddy so it is compromise\nThere's a museum that about the troubles in capital city did you visited yeah\nWhen I was told and cricket there were some list this so I was at the museum and they put it into the history of the whole problem from an sixteen hundred on world\nIt was very good and you call that a rest day this was there for tickets players and I didn't have to do anything they'll have bronco brought a lot of interviews of cricketer school now the stars one of them is Russia con you may know if you follow

day I Want to introduce you to a couple of people who are actually not focusing this week and what is Peter tie\nA journalist in the ... the capital of the north west region we were talking about that

understand you are not voting why\nI wouldn't be voting and the reason is that it isn't saying going out on voting day here in a man that just like in India or the English speaking ... areas\nSeparate vote that voting will not be taking place in the north west and southwest regions from the hill and anyone who will be seen on the streets and in polling station so I mean was that if you did attack

regions they're promising held on anyone who will be seen on the streets and in polling station so I mean we've seen repeated attacks Susan launching of\nA presidential campaigns on people who are seen to be taking sides with any political party\nAnd I think that was also seen their heavy deployment of security forces into English speaking regions but just by these military presence high military presence separates his forces have continued to carry out the attack\nAre leading to as far as the boxes with the military and we've seen civilians are caught in these she has brought to the security forces become sometime soon discriminates index ... done\nCertainly doubt the government's ability to guarantee the safety of votes is\nSo you don't feel that you don't feel it's safe enough align what's your reason for not going out to voters which I heard you're not doing either\nI don't really want to vote because I don't think my early ... there will not be fussy collections to me that you gave me a deeply in a very many people are not really that these weren't changed the way that you spent I don't think that any change can\nCome see you know you don't think it can change I can hear your some of the street sounds coming from you on day which is lovely\nTo have on the radio but the I Want to put both of your points to Renee and it's here from BBC I freak secures he cannot be guaranteed feels Peter I land feels like the system is rigged I think if I understand the way you're saying it's aligned and that his foot one\nPound cat that when you're looking at for example during oldies campaign when he comes back to play the position none of them actually address\nThis issue of security which is quite maybe the most important because you want people to vote in the\n... the fact that they're going into this election without actually having to make it as the main cool over there\nAnd campaign because everybody's bringing solution Africa wants to become president then I could bring then I couldn't do that then I couldn't go down to the halfway speak to our but that's not going to come to the table\nAnd meanwhile nobody's actually address and so\nThey're going into an election way you have almost twenty percent of the population which is not the present time [noise]\nI understand what is the biggest issue for you peace or when it comes if you where to go out and vote for what is the thing that's most important to you for your country\nI think what we really need now income alone is a kind of national recon mission we need the government to reach out to the people in between English speaking parts of this country with an olive branch and open up dialogue a dialogue kind of inclusive dialogue because where we are now\nI mean it's kind of on President said that\nThe government has not really opens up a options of dialogue and we need this kind of that happening in the presence of al ... was the third part to like the United nations and I think this is really the one thing that\nShould be handled by the or should be talked about by the or the ... by the uh country that's going in for election but like\nI Would say nobody's really talking about how they're going to be able to bring this up for it to an even you know the or the people on board to negotiate for an end to the I have to speak I mean people are kind of really\nVery pessimistic there's no end in sight what was the government really decides to do something\nEither be conciliation or reshuffle doesn't seem to be on the car and you know it doesn't seem to be on the ... because\nShould be handled by the or she'd be talked about by the or the ... by the communists we'll going in for you didn't mention but like\nA ... nobody's really talking about how they're going to be able to bring\nTo separate the an even you know the or the people on board to negotiate for an end to the U.S or speak that people are kind of really very pessimistic there's no end in sight what was the government really decides to do something\nEither be conciliation or ... doesn't seem to be on the cars you know it doesn't seem\nTo be on the ... because when I'm older ... position parties at the moment with the leader I Know of any solution\nIs almost as I Would say it's own it looks almost as they can just that you go to the way you taste so that they can use their full election game which is when a in the old manufacturing when they're talking about the the situation in the north and south west of camera and\nThey're offering solutions you off or when\nThey do become president went on to become president and I'll make sure they ...\nThey want the people even asking they going to an election that they believe that if the odds that\nIt can climb festival that issue of the security is not even one of the issue that they actually been addressing but they believe that they're going to all of them believe they have a child when none of the people actually asked them that we want to create a coalition\nTo be able to at present one country it's against the income then but it hasn't happened because obesity what everybody\nThinks they were waiting and then you have big egos dive in place so do the question is who I ... I ... that food they own a truly benefits or they actually really bad for the good of the population to what the ...\nExperiments terminate on T shirts and also align giving their views on the elections coming up this weekend in camera [noise]\nNear the McGovern with you on a west from the b._b._c.
