the nation come up can you tell us about that right\nIt is a difficult was it happened in the early morning last year as I say a a neighborhood called to say that this young man twenty two year old Adam\n... had been wandering around naked in the car does clearly having some kind of break down so that he hadn't been armed and he'd gone back into his apartment so first of the police came over there were banging on his front door calling the wrong Maine\nAnd with since spoken to Addams family who've who've told us you know he frequently have delusions and hallucinations and may have thought that it wasn't really happening I Want is very clear when you watch the footage you obviously can't\nTell us through just listening to it he's he's extremely passive through this he says I'm very blankly\nUh he he doesn't lash out he doesn't uh abide by that they come out and they keep telling him to to get out of the shower [noise] um but he's not a threat he's he's certainly don't get a weapon he hasn't gotten closer and he's he's in the shower\nAnd uh he was taste and taste and and as we say he died soon after but in spite of all of that in spite of hearing exactly what you you had a a knowing the background the story for district attorney in that case decided that Adams that was nothing to do with the actions of the police\nThat worked so they there was never any uh they they wouldn't have any prosecutions in that case and it never went to to to a criminal trials to that\nGets a coup too long distance I mean is that right not serious 'cause training here do you think\nThere are lots of issues ... what this case although it doesn't explain all the cases and we'll get into those uh because we've done quite a bit of research uh over recent months off on this issue and and looking at the massive numbers involved here we're talking about at least a quarter of the hundreds of people killed by the police every year\nOr who have gotten some form of disability but there are some people who've been researching this for a long time and there isn't a credible national data that's collected them as they're all those who think it could be up to ... off to have some form of disability whether that's a mental physical or an intellectual disability\nBut but you know one of the reasons is you know why were police involved in that incident in the first place this is something that should have been intended to buy buy medical professionals trained medical professionals and increasingly in the U.S because of a mental health system that's a widely seen to be to be failing\nThe police are being cold much more to two incidents like this but that is not the whole picture that doesn't account for for for for all of the types of cases we've looked at\nIt is about you know the way the police reacts themselves who didn't just about additional\nTraining on on disability but it is about a problem in that\nThis is something that should have been intended to but by medical professionals trained medical professionals and increasingly in the U.S because of the mental health system that's a widely seen to be to be failing\nThe police are being cold much more to two incidents like this but that is not the whole picture that doesn't account for for for for all of the types of cases we've looked at\nIt is about you know the way the police reacts themselves who didn't just about additional\nTraining on on disability but it is about a problem in that basic training you know I guess we'll get to that little bit as we told through other cases\nThe families are not the ... of course and as you said in the case of that in that the pizza found not response for anything they can do is to have any justice they feel they can get\nIt's really very difficult it is a once it has been decided the local level but you know the police don't go to trial of close families can then take a civil cases but in a lot of these cases\nThe police are protected if they all seem to be acting in good faith\nOr if they are seen to be acting in self defense and those are the biggest a defense against the in cases like this they say and in some of the other cases we broke up they said we were acting in self defense\nOn that there's not an argument against that because you know there have been similar cases of set precedent in the U.S Supreme Court with police now say they uh they they felt that the life was in danger and so they took the action they did\nI'm there's not much you can do legally about that I'm similarly get the acting in good faith and that was their argument this in this particular case that the you heard about earlier\nThat they went in that case I have to help them to get him some medical attention that's why they had to have and restrained and as simple as that sounds I asked one to have you seen the footage that is a ... that is how they essentially got away with not being prosecuted in that case\nTell us about some of the other cases that you came\nAcross [noise] well you know the underlying issues here have is about ah when I say about the way to lose hope or a fear\nOf course they are\nHaving an thousands and thousands of interactions that every day I was going for a while but where they go wrong it is because the complaint is that they too often command and control like they go into a situation a shout commands\nAnd if somebody doesn't comply than they escalate the situation which can sometimes make use of deadly force except as we've seen or as we've heard already with Adams case\nYou know sometimes people just can't comply either because their skits ... testicle or for that I'm On one of the cases we looked at was the case in Oklahoma City where there was a man on his front lawn\nOr the police had gone to his house his name was Mike they'll send you a gun to his house to investigate an accident that his father and involved in a hit and run in ... but he was on the front porch they hadn't even income for him\nThey saw that he was carrying something that they perceived to be a weapon actually who is a piece of piping so they shouted commands him to drop it he also had learning difficulties so it's clear from eyewitnesses made was\nThat he panicked that he couldn't care for all the neighbors around was shouting he can't have your command but he was shot dead on his front lawn\nFirm for not a
