been some indications I'm In the American media and in some of the media as well that they may be\nThis is just to the possibility you know the maybe the soldiers will acknowledge responsibility um if not on the higher echelons of power there but maybe you know some sort of a rogue elements or or some sort of\nClaim of responsibility for so we're still we still don't do that's the big question everybody's waiting for a what the Turks will come out with and what the soldiers would come up with from there so\nThat's pretty useful just to get a check on exactly ... all the different strands we should all set to friday's Fifteen nationals named by turkey Saudi nationals suspected by them and I know on our website now there's there's a list of who's been named and how they might or might not be connected what do we know about outfits that ... thing\nFor me there's something interesting going on in Turkey that the Turkish government itself is not releasing everything as not releasing any information all the information is coming through Turkish media but the type of information that these Turkish newspapers and websites are releasing them permission that no media organization can get pulled all\nLike you know CCTV at the airport or a cease to be in the street so it's clear that these newspapers are being leaked from governmental ... or ... ignored security agencies\nSo I'm about a

with social network profiles that that have the same name and try and set a fake emails and stuff like that I signed up for the moment 'cause it's important to get their life is on the lines that you're covering wheels wants to ...\nWhen they leave Saudi Arabia's image in the world what it says about the country in ... and ... how do you think the story reflects on what it's been portrayed as
