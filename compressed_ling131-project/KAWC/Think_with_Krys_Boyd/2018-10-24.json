things considered and hear the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's just the take away the ending Vegas\nOver the past few days President Trump has been crisscrossing the country stumping for Republican candidates in the lead up to the mid term elections\nAnd one of the biggest talking point for\nFear of immigration\nA large group of people they caught a caravan [noise]\nHe's referring there to the caravan of Central American migrants that's been growing since the first set off almost two weeks ago from Honduras\nThe migrants have now reached southern Mexico where many or requesting asylum others will continue the arduous weeks long journey by foot to the United states the president has made no secret of his feelings about certain groups of immigrants [noise] you wouldn't believe history for\nAre animals they're bringing drugs\nThey're bringing crime rape is they are not our friend believe me I don't Jay travelers calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America\nYour cameras at certain butterflies MS or you're going to buy readily\nYou're going to find everything what we're not allowed to them that are just\nTo help us unpack all of this is Ron Nixon the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us hey thanks for having me so lots of stuff to take a into consideration here\nAnd covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us hey thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but clearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who was in the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily migrating and seeking to uh get asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there are some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh it looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who we're seeing that there are about ten terrorists or the specter terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWell it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people\nThe fencing toward our border in kind of the truth is well let me let me just statistics on this I mean in in the last fiscal year of oh we apprehended more than\nMore than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border of from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nOther than Mexico includes everybody you know from Mexico and that was not a direct them into okay no no including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border\nEither get asylum or crossing the border illegally were uh people from Mexico\nAnd on one of those stats the vice president exciting about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat's that that the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency a border patrol and it basically says that the agency prevent tend known or suspected terrorists from traveling to are entering the United states\nEvery day and fiscal two thousand ah Seventeen\nIt makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border uh and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming\nTo the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming with the airports so\nYeah it it's called fleeting as that that is meant to be one thing with this whole caravan it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell with this caravan of people\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen so far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that MS Thirteen as is a part of a group in the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see MS Thirteen I I don't know what a mess Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... him as Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my covered\nMS Thirteen looks like that so [noise] you know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles a when it comes to race in in politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here on do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm election I think immigration\nI'm you know obviously it it helped to president get elected and this has been one of if not these signature issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... plays well a particularly now you see cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to the ... that they are there are these people who are trying to take to get into our country\nUm so I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as you know political scientists and pollsters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house of representatives\nIt we've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the caravan of the Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan as being supported by Democrats a George ... his name had been tossed about can we confirm any of those claims\nThere's no evidence that the Democrats are George Soros or Venezuela have sponsors of this particular care of and and and I remember this is something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen with this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami to New York from what I Am right now yeah right and they're walking right so take\nThat into consideration thank you

reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice advocates against it today Danielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway\nThank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from a state assembly member it was sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents on it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke\nTraffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep um throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why uh pops up and wants to be a at the white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clock steady or around also when we are using daylight saving time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because ah ends and public health benefit because people are exercising their eating at restaurants they're playing sports they're walking their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can you remind us\nYeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but\nAt the time out if it was in the late Seventeen hundred\nHe was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habits just leap a to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon and one morning he got woken up by the loud sound at six AM\nAnd realized oldest son's up I could be could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles on but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries like was Germany the was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort adopted daylight saving time to save energy and it didn't used to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um\nIt was then made optional between the wars brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight savings time schedule that we have now uh in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight savings time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo [noise] but it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold\nThere dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress and did the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps\nSpent a year early now I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the shift of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes\n[noise] you know on the equator we have twelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so they're here for instance in California if this proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea\nThere were lots of folks who supported as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless to measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness\nEducation pathway for immigration prison reform lifted them even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take a look now\nWe've just kind of coming up on the end of the segment here but is that an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with the decrease accidents and increased productivity\nDaniel Benton as an editor and reporter for cake you eat science Daniel thanks so much
