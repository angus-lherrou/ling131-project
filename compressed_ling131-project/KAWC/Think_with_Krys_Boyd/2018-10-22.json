explanation of ... death a new report from the New York times reveals how the Saudi Government uses troll farms to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTo farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field public relations were crusts or a customer or something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attack content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that as positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is ...\nTo the highest levels of the Saudi Government well it would be\nPretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that a grip on say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman a man who was you know that sort of the de facto ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these drones were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes an away unreasonable\nThey also tried to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's a hash tag that picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them\nThey can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers are government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this has got to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really have the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they were able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called her sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media debates of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trading list on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they get on Twitter that can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them a perceived their own their own government\nBut you also reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person well\nWe know that there was the Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then Twitter was basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he hasn't been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because a democracy she'll east death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns let's not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked at the gift\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... by the time he was killed had this last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter\nHe was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat in English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just saw this on Twitter ... so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments lots and lots of abuse and and and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know try to influence the way that the content he was putting out was being received by people\nOr we should also be clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls where people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they ah said anything about all this have folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response for Twitter to the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of a network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi ... network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for Twitter they they're trying to find the balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are nefarious\nThan

Fifteen people\nStudents over the past two days in a gun it's done a including a suicide bombing in the ... of of the capital Kabul and which Fifteen people were killed in that incident we understand a suicide bomber was trying to get inside the polling station when police stopped them from doing that\nAt that moment he blew himself up killing people who are around him but having said that fool the tragic loss of life that that was by I'm gone standards this was an uptick cheat Kelly\nBad set of days many people that fit that there would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I've been reporting from us comments on for a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example I I I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one single attack them and we didn't see anything like that from a security perspective that to me that when people who were killed that wherever attack people why in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that\nEpisode will floating stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would the\nAre they considered democratic by the electric because of the attacks and the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand a lot of people are quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption I see that being in ... in Afghanistan over the last\nA week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that indeed the elections are unlike in previous elections and number of the candidate for young with from professional backgrounds but wet educated\nAnd and people felt that they were in a position to offer of guns are some real political change and move away from a kind of system of politics that dominated by\nEthnic ... and buy all would warlords\nHaving said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan of delays that it cut during the election protests are a number of polling stations didn't open on on on Saturday or open late or early voting has to be extended into Sunday or what I was that some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that\nDespite having registered they couldn't find any names on the boat to the rules are problems with a a new biometric both to verification system that was introduced a little bit of a last minute ready\nIt's designed to prevent people both the more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of the elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threats that they share you know something that might be resonating with this electorate\n[noise] the one thing to note is that in and I've gone to San Juan parliament isn't to teach the powerful in comparison to the to the position of the president um\nThe second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates stand as independence even if they are affiliated political parties because political parties in in the country often associated with\nScience journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to that and he saw a lot of people who a form of journalists a civil society out to be standing and these are some of the people who\nBoth his what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them though the rules are a lot of big businessmen um\nStanding and these are some of the people who\nBoth his what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them do the rules are a lot of big businessmen\nUm the the children of former so called warlords who was standing for the first time as well so what a mixed bag of candidates who is standing on a huge number I mean over two thousand five hundred candidates standing across the country in ... when I was\nThere were eight hundred candidates for thirty three seats so the ... paper was about Fifteen pages long kind of looked like a newspaper reader\nAnd there were about four hundred women who ran among those candidates what can you tell us about them\nExactly so uh that's more like ... different number from the the number of women who riding in the last parliamentary elections in two thousand and ten to ... around four hundred women who took part in those\nBut as I say the number of of women among these candidates who people are are more enthusiastic about um I was speaking to to to one a female candidate she's twenty six year old very well known\nA TV reporter in Afghanistan and she was saying to me that she was standing because uh she viewed the older politicians is basically being corrupt and acting like a mafia\nOr ... in ... and she wanted a Afghanistan to move away from them as what is the fact that there were four hundred women are four hundred old women standing or I think around sixty percent of the candidates while under the age of forty\nAnd what about the current President Asif ... Ashraf Ghani he's been a president for over four years now does he still has support\n[noise] he said he doesn't and in fact one of the reasons why these elections I seen it so crucial it because next April will have presidential elections and they'll be\nMuch more politically significant because as I say the ... system that is quite centralized to the president really the key to the country and so these parliamentary elections which were meant to have taken place around three years ago and they've been delayed ever since then\nI only just happened now so the that was seen as a kind of dry run if you if you like for those presidential elections\nPeople wanted to see a wood enough off gone feel safe coming out to vote a will result be accepted that's another crucial question because a previous elections I've been marred by allegations of fraud and many fed same could happen again so these\nAre all key concerns that that people have a about the next presidential elections and we're hoping to get some kind of indication from these elections about how\nTo conduct or money inside Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent for the BBC ... thanks for joining us thank you for having\nMore for the takeaway come from ...
