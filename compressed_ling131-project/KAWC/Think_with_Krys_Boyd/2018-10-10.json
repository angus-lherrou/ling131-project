visited four of the districts public schools can you tell us or described for our listeners a little bit about what you saw what were the conditions like\nSo few of the schools are actually in very good shape they are modern there's new tables in the high school cafeteria\nAnd those were in good shape the oldest building and used by the district is Webster elementary school and this is for\nChildren who are just starting out this is for pre K. kindergarten and first grade students and the desks were marred from years of use their bathroom was a partially out of order\nThere with peeling paint in the hallways and you could tell that you know it had been re painted and re painted and re painted over and over again this is the facility where the heating system had gone out a couple of years ago and some parents tried to pay to have it fixed tried to help the school district\nAnd um then beating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his

I'm tansy and if they got\nTheir new details today and the mysterious disappearance of Saudi dissident and journalists them off the show the show gave us resident went missing earlier this month is turkey sandwich or does official tells the New York times that he was killed in the Saudi\nConflict and they stumble on orders of the highest levels of the Saudi Government with me on the line with Carlotta Gall the symbol bureau chief for the New York times ... thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him\nOver the years was that he was well connected to the government and he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior official so for us we knew him that way and then lately he'd taken out of a\nPost with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and that side as we see clearly now with its fate\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government car lot of what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that\nClearly giving it to John honest to publish that those two groups of Saudis that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn October the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes on the left the same day I'm\nOut in his shoulder took his official\nSaudi officials Fifteen of them want to separate planes they came in and and\nFrom Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that clearly giving it to John honest to publish that there was two groups of Saudis that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes on the left the same day on the Saudi officials are Turkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in\nIn in a different times that day and they left the same day and the ... officials are saying they were essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing all that so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking the access to the consulate which of course is the dramatic ... trees so that are also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid detailed in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone soul among their equipment\nKnow they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building putting them and they'll call\n'em we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the promises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all and the United states obviously had close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the Turks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world on so\nEverybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based has been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states has made you know at least the president has pulls no punches in his this day and I think for many I'm In the press and not\nAttack on press freedoms has actually I think extended worldwide we've seen a number of journalists killed in Mexico we've seen a number of journalists killed in the ear you recently\nHow do we know who we can trust with these stories

only you know the president of the usa criticized journalists but the president talk you often criticizes John including foreign journalists let me working here\nUm but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the press or banning from working or even share as Jonathan put in prison\nThis is altogether different league because it's not only an act against a journalist who was clearly\nA disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticism but to dispose of him breaking international law I'm In another country also be disposing of him in the country or take him out of the country but it's completely I'm\nA different league of of what we have seen ... coming from the U.S president on on the touch president so get those already shocked to hear both in government on in society I think the government or radio gold because they knew ... well he was\nHe counted among his friends people who are senior advisors and the government um he had a great reputation because he's been reporting for such he is on Middle Eastern Muslim a fad and so he was\nHe was well known and well respected an for him to end up like this is is pulling to a country that
