Spiegel magazine in American Woman named Catherine my your guy is speaking out for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel in Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examine by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story and she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are assigned by rebel do himself\nRonaldo denies the allegations and it's called

thanks for having me something that we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go for the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your gut and how did she enrolled Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin Oregon is actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about the ... occurred in two thousand nine she was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which has a policy I guess you get to his entourage\nSo he according to the dirt Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nChristiana run all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and under and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed the police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was a saying oh it's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost in the so coupled with her own trauma\nAnd the mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players and aspiring at that time so it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not\nAs experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't hop twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about that they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story it this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly is because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in a sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere made no way so I think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do exam and then we pitched this story to about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that ... has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue is maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think is is applicable here it as well\nBecause I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted with him or his\nIt's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think is is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlets and no one wanted the viewers nobody wanted to store and I'm like how can this not be possible but this isn't the first time this happened to me\nThe same thing with David ... the critical keeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nThat we we should also be clear though that that heat that run although has responded and denying these allegations right\nOf course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid ... a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars than NDA like let's not forget that that happened then she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nDo speak all would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that saved dotted the odds and cross the T's and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those teams gonna Souter Spiegel they would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRead it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment a particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a\nReal lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world and other issues so I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant he was given basic you know a pass by the media which was complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to

so called raise the age legislation passed last year\nAs a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail have to be moved out by to day in New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge change it to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nVenue covers urban affairs here in our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tens enough good to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right\nRight that's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're facing it in to this is the start of the law to the to the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court\nIf it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been a specially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm is the case involves sexual assault if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that then the case one day\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year old now have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening yes\nThat's true too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving a prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case\nSo another thing to mention is that this law is not retroactive so that means if you're already serving a prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience that sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there\nNow let's talk about where they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx and so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change so\nThere's ... there's been said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them in the head repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named college sprout or who was in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed that he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on heat his family couldn't meet the three thousand dollars fail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by the journalist Jennifer Government from the New Yorker I got a lot of attention um then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is sort of the backdrop of where we are today\nAnd there's been um lots of talk particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan\nTo essentially shut down Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course we're all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand so um [noise]\nThis is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off to jail to this or to close down Rikers Island is going to be controversial to the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up\nNew jailed in ... I'm so these would be burrow based shows that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been\nTremendous opposition so far what about you\nNow off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down records out it's going to be controversial to the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up\nNew jails in ... I'm so these would be ... that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been tremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned clique brought her and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people\nIn and out [noise] um right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which um seems like it won't happen\nThere is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned\nBy the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and say that um math bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds and women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people\nUm they were trying to raise five million dollars and the ... that happened throughout the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids\nEvery part of the planning process has been guided by this city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you ...
