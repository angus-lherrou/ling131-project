codes and better enforcement was Hurricane Andrew\nA tremendous damage but in the aftermath we saw that a lot of the construction wasn't even being built to the uh the codes and the community and so we we learned at both the codes are important but also the sportsmen inspection of those codes were critical\nAnd when you talk about storm surge is one of the biggest concerns does that indicated in your experience that folks should not be thinking about building along the coast at this point [noise] well\nI think we have to be very careful about how we build along the coast I think in many areas

contributing editor for tribal affairs at high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video\nI thought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with a ...\nShe's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren and also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning and I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history was probably the wrong approach\n[noise] it's interesting there because you don't want to criticize gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the method the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered by the media inappropriately\nI think it's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them\nThe problem I had with senator Warren's approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that as damaging to native people to give you a little bit of context I I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am\nNot much darker than she is a outwardly the place for that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history\nOr in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government\nAnd in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that feed into stereotypes and myth about native people\nBlood quantum is a very a thorny subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so\nBy putting a a stop on me\nA degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood as you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction is is a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean in the native\nAmerican community so when the government put many of us on the trail of tears my great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to\nThat record still stands and it makes it easy easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots\nThat way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled as such now some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance is also part of Iowa ... the ... nation of Oklahoma\nYou have to be one fourth pilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar but when it comes to DNA tests I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you're a Native American there is no DNA test to shed say definitively you are an indigenous person\nWhen it comes to tribal issues DNA tests are used to show who your parents are to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am\nIssues DNA tests are used to show who your parents are to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am tired or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator Morris decision um to release this video I felt\nLike there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people I think\nHer response helps foster this narrative that like I said to her blood quantum is important or that a DNA test can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true in reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like their own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically but there is an invisibility problem with Indian country\nNon native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nI think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotype that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\nScrambling brewer is a reporter with the high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation grand thanks so much for your insights

Hernandez professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up with you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is that racism is it ...\nIt is both I mean talk about a parody medic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both of jet anti gender bias and race bias the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say very toxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to sort of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up is it becoming easier to sell in this current climate is most definitely easy to sell because it combined both\nSuperficial power that that ah offers up\nIs it becoming easier to sell in this current climate it is most definitely easy to sell because it combined both\nA quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white can engage with that type of thinking\nBecause what they do is they disassociate this idea of waiting is has culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the idea of a sudden about blackness it's about fat black culture\nDavid what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise]\nWell in some ways it's actually very old I mean I started doing this when I was covering Miriam nations in Idaho in late seventies early eighties and day to claim that they were only for a white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of voice from is this group says that\nYou know the claim to just be pro white and defending white interests but you know but of believe they're pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other races but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is that the underlying dynamic here\nIs less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... boy groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer and they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big Simone drive so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white guys joining their ranks\nBut what I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality sunnier\nYou wanted to weigh in here that I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that now these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color\nI'm not just that they're pro white and this is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much about authoritarianism and I agree with you there\nThey're also spouting lack of pro white rhetoric at I don't think we should be dismissing that as I say inflation has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean that fight about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it it is it's very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because\nUh they're marketing it in ways that I mean the always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical right is very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is\nA problematic well I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested and there were some accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough\nTo stop the attackers there was also an assumption that there would support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nI Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement\nSupport within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now as as being you know very heavily politicized by organizations like the earth keepers\nA which specifically or you know this is essentially a patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement\nUh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much acting against the they very much see\nThe uh anti fascist says the bigger problem and I think that's a problem Tanya your your thoughts\nWhen I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in the white supremacists authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving our it's just about free speech right that these folks are chest spouting their ideas\nAnd I think that part of the underlying problem here is\nThe stereotype of the United states has being so absolute it's about free speech that you can say any kind of hateful things on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it result in violence although history shows us how intimately into intertwined racist speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD the takeaway did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually what's supported by the NYPD so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they'd say that they called me again it's an individual who's a provocateur tour who does not speak for the NYPD\nThey say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on to what they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see that says the trend that is going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help this because this is all new I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back underground but uh I'm not very hopeful in that regard because I think uh this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid ... the author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center and tiny
