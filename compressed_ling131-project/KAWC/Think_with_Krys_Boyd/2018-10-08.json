Kavanaugh is the newest justice on the Supreme Court although the voting was almost entirely along party lines there were some senators whose votes we were all watching among them Susan Collins of Republican from Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia and the only Democrat who voted to confirm Kavanaugh\nCollins who will be up for reelection twenty twenty was a crucial swing vote in the cabinet appointments and she ultimately voted to confirm\nMentioned is currently running for reelection and the state that Trump won by a forty percent margin of victory so where are the political realities each is facing in their own states joining us to discuss this is Emily Stewart a reporter with box Hi Emily thanks for having me and we're also joined by Jake Sacramento political reporter with the Charleston Gazette mail Hi Jake\n... from you know I Want to start with you a senator Collins came out this weekend um to defend her vote on Kavanaugh let's take a listen to what she said on CNN I Do\nBelieve that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the is\nEmily a Collins is not up for re election in November but from what you've seen what's the reaction been so far to her vote I mean\nShe pretty popular I mean and it seemed to have at least for the time being harmed her obviously she's not up for election until twenty twenty so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed I'm\nMean we'll see sort of what happens in the next several months and years but I think that a lot of her constituents are disappointed and more broadly I think women around the United states who are looking to her to defend them are also disappointed and her\nThe court as it has been described by Oliver

...\nThis is the takeaway with tens and I'm a a guy from WNYC NPR I public radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nOver the summer the White House made a declaration of the nation war on poverty was quote largely over and the success this is part of the administration's argument for an acting stricter work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo is the war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today ... Texas the small poor border town depend on its relationship with a knock on Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall\nYou know there's a lot of Kelly\nSure there are some places that housing\nThat out I mean they can yeah it's real quiet at\nAll I think they've loving dollars here to tell us all about that feeds the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the take away could be with your ... so what is ... like\n... Texas is sort of idiosyncratic little\nIn Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times and a reporter Saddam Hussein who spent some time that some are down there found a place that's\nWally ... here to tell us all about that he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the take away to be with your ten the ... so what is ... Texas like\n... Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nAnd the reporters who hotter Hussein who spent some time that summer down there found a place that really caught against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on its cross border sister town in Mexico oh you're not going back to Mexico\nAnd as a result quite literally people depend on ... for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be build um most of the people there feel as if the community would be not only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty or not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going to quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else\n[noise] poverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and the Naga to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact to a Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated that they feel that a Washington and the federal government in a way is not heating their concerns\nThis was a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there is certainly a other\n... and in daily necessities might be there to help both in an acute situation but also to and\nAnd just keeping yourself a fender keeping your family fed or making sure that that you have the basics of daily life this was really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to [noise]\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in the ... and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall um when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nYou know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout um throughout the week but tell us why you chose to places you chose what is it uh\nSlow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in the ... and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities you know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country\nUm and we'll be focusing on those throughout um throughout the week but tell us why you chose to places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market\nIs at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that they are struggling it might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell her\nIncredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where\nHousing is such an issue on everyone's mind or should I say the lack of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where\nPeople feel incredibly disenfranchised so all these places that we may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether it's the\nUh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what the what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nAnd we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections well could those elections mean for communities like ... all of\nThis was happening with the backdrop of the midterm election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states they will certainly have the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election day sale for places like this are struggling they they face\nA big question to which is whether they want to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people is simply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to participate in such a critical vote as the one that we're facing right\nNow [noise] they ... as the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity an editor of this new six part series it launches tomorrow and

what's in formerly known as a MacArthur genius fellowship a grant of six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that recipients can use however they'd like over the course of five years it allows us\nTo be able to practice hour hour and a half pay some time to create new work\nWithout having to have the burden of figuring out where our income is applied to be derived from you know we don't have to find supplemental jobs to be able to do the work that we do we can actually will just be the writer that we were sort of been pushing to be all of our career\nOr read though has already carved out an impressive career for herself writing the Broadway bound musical and too proud about the temptations\nAnd serving in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless and she's also authored a series of plates that in Detroit a city that's central to her identity or\nI'm from Detroit I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit in my family lives there and so for me Detroit is personal it's about family I always say that\nDetroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city where sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a a narrative around race in economics and our nation and so for me it's important to be writing about that in writing from a place of within a\nSo much love for the city because I have some of his family there and and I had such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plates you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um it's something that's become a huge problem in in the United states\nHow do you take a topic like that and bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic well first\nAll I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um that's something that's become a huge problem in in the United states\nHow do you take a topic like that and bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nWell first of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I've spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships to to teaching because of a it's a public school teacher and private will teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles I saw my play pipeline is about\nLooking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who the teacher and a public school so we get to see her relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships about private school system\nAnd we're looking at basically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children and educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and very most analyses young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who is putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you're referring there to the opportunities the women of color\nSpecifically have within the creative fields tell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\n[noise] well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochure of things and it looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidence than large and small way that our nation right now right and leadership it comes from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater and Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse um background and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they're making the decision that so I think we need to see a shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just on the state of off of off the stage because it it it's a time and the world while I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not the people of color on the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences\nOf diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nAnd that so I think we need to see a shift and that sort of the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just on the state of off of off the stage because it it it's a time and the world while I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences\nOf diverse backgrounds entered the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nIn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there is an assumption about what people of color will and will not spend their money on and that is\n... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or won't spend it on things out of the significant as fall I think it as often as about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something\nThat's what the other hadn't figured out but I Do also think affordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed and theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when he's talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house while I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money for it comes to you all have to eat your food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to move me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm not just\nA flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship with that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique Marie so is the playwright whose
