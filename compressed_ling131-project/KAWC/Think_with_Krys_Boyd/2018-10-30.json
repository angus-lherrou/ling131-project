on terror three that is controlled by the duties in an effort to uh\nIt offensively in an effort to isolate them but we just had the effect of really falling very heavily on the country's civilian

project at the Carnegie\nYour reporting on in the New York times was accompanied by some pretty devastating photos taken by Tyler Hicks I'm kind of get the New York times of young Yemeni children on the brink of death by starvation can you give us a sense of how and why that decision was made to include the soda in the reporting\nWell those are certainly some of the most shocking pulled it I think the times has used in recent years and the decision to use them was not taken lightly and\nAre able to have said often is now we tend to\nErr on the side of caution in publishing very graphic pictures but there were a couple of very compelling reasons and to to publish these pictures and the sentence one I think was that these photographs constitute a very shocking reminder of the time and has knock on the Web\nPage I think some consciousness there's an idea assignment or something that happened in the Nineteen eighties in Ethiopia perhaps\nA in places like Somalia in two thousand and eleven and these were really are reminder that in in this day and age a a very severe starvation is reality and Yemen and the second factor which I think was probably the most compelling one is that this is very much a manmade and this is not a potentially ...\nThis is not a humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring ... who's in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen or in many of the times we visited the stores full of food the problem is that nobody are very few people can afford to buy it because of the country's economy has been devastated and the economic devastation is a direct product of the way that the war has been waged\nLargely by Saudi Saudi led coalition some of the decision they have taken like withholding radius from a million civil servants in government controlled and\nWho the controlled areas had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as the plunge into the value of the Yemeni currency at\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before and the money they have is worth fall on that and for people who are already living on the brink this is enough to push them over the edge\nAnd that which I think we're talking to Declan Walsh of the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what is has it been so far it has it been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just seems devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over the summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port call today\nThe U.S the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid the entrance Yemen so a lot of concern has focused on ensuring pressuring the competence that the fighting should not reach support 'em\nEntrance Yemen so a

[noise]\nIn two thousand and four hurricane Ivan bowled over an oil rig belonging to tailor energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years\nEvery day the scientist and feeling between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy has cleaned up some of the math but they've also been suing the government to avoid a full clean up the site and if this bill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us forever membership to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or\nTell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the one week appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were\nPut together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily from multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan and two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore it's actually only exist to fight the spill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end the sleep they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there is a money issue here but what is it about this spill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this is I think it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that is true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though well I mean that's a I think that's open to debate certainly and um uh the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do what they can the problem is is that when that hurricane rolled through knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company with the company says now the company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing potentially greater risk if they go in there and they\nPick the settlement away could make leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government and the company about what needs to be done next but do the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else on their below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill anywhere lake on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill ten and twelve ten\nAnd twenty tend to be people will feel as we all remember we were kind of transfixed by images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom to see for it it was coming out all at once you know over the period of granted\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out all at once and that has you know it ... birds on the seashore and it created an environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious when it's staggering out in the oil can be ...\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shore it's about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nDon't flex also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place again I Believe that\nThere are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says\nDifferently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oiling birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronically\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they doing\nThere's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronically\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they doing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably Louisiana for a program called tops the tea in top

be work is Taylor or his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators\nAnd she had hired lawyers or to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a of a fight that's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition the somewhat obscure government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more\nDown below the sea floor in terms of drawing a intervention well to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's become is about money and about how much more they need to spend or have they will spend down below the surface\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us\nFor having me for\nThree thousand scientists working around the Gulf about the Taylor oil spill bird and ask for a marine geologist at\nThe University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have
