[noise]\n\nThe [noise] the [noise] this has to take away the tansy Nevada\nAll this week we've been talking with reporters at the center for Public Integrity about their series abandoned in America which explores cities and towns across the country where poverty is inescapable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis is affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the residents to do manage to get subsidized place to live conditions only adds to the indignity of living and working in poverty\nMolded by the army and so when they did was getting rid of some old they just hang on top of everything so after a lot of mothers who is this coming through you know through the feelings you know in my basement I had gone through oh my gosh you have no idea when I was [noise]\nThat's January Harris a mother and receptionist in St Louis January went from living in an apartment run by the St Louis housing authority to a townhouse run by a private landlord one that she paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program\nBut even though she works full time January says the assistant she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that is one fish in a or or

time job if not you know I feel it's not a\nThere's a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads\nTo me that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that is what looks he's the beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting\nIn St Louis especially in the city about twenty six point seven percent of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income to find affordable housing and especially if you need a sense\nThe last time the city opened its housing choice voucher commonly known as section eight and twenty fourteen so what you have is people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nA for housing that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city in the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for section ... voucher we're what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture people are either in unstable conditions there living with family members might even be facing homelessness where they're living in sub par or helping conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program works and um I Know it's a complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do\nYes so with the U.S section eight housing choice voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and\nThe federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on there and\nTell us about January Harris January here it's um\nLive out in Ferguson, Missouri she lives in the county of St Louis within a week of her moving into her town home for her and her youngest daughter Michael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just\nA two minute drive away and you have worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand and so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that President Trump Ben in carts and I\nHave said are ways to get out of the system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state minimum wage of seven eighty five but even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job\nUm a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increase\nSo if they want to go to the food I Can't see will do not receive any job\nI work every day for their trees I mean they they made a problem like this is the city so it's fairly citrus visions of where they let me say this and there's no way to get off I was literally probably\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification at all\nI think when it comes to public housing\n... is that being exacerbated by gentrification\nAt all\nI think when it comes to public housing on section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting and that the housing authorities are\nWander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords you want to accept a section ... housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that whether that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property and also for the landlord a\nThere is a long process of paperwork and inspections that goes into whether or not you choose to be a section eight landlords so I think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson\nA HUD secretary who are essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule that require communities that receive Hod funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that steps\nIn the Nineteen fifties and the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a desire to reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually I'm when I'm visiting various communities especially along the north side\nPeople are just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these in the house is look at all these abandoned homes nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet\nAnd that economic prowess and growth that Trump sees for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of the city\n... beach him as a political reporter at the center

for joining us and as a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this is um let's talk a little bit about motivation right well I mean we were hearing this is a year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but there's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black woman to run for office\nWell I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations and you're thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women have been a black woman had been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempts and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back to the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male\nAnd that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation and the electorate as saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues are regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalysts for all of these women to run such strong primary and you know we're really looking forward to some great pickups\nOn November sex so let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically in and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday on the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation and the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability a black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about um I think that's exactly it ice higher heights who was born out of the notion that\nWe needed a space for black women a political home for black women and go into a car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic cells or to the campaign trail has really been a a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at candidates\nTo a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on Boston we look at what kind of a volunteer structure they have we look at a you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of\nThese races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive we should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house or\nThat we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive we\nShould also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding you know how often is the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but\nAre there specific barriers to fund raising that black women candidates face in particular\nYou know well I think there is you know unfortunately the um institutional wealth\nOr we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to amass a the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making a sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nBut I think it is also thinking through it's not just the the large checks but\nAh being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contribution that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters and most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want and I think we saw that here in New York will out of ...
