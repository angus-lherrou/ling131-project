administration from the president of the United states that\nYou know we've seen from the Muslim ban 'em to pointing fingers at groups that are violent like MS Thirteen that have committed terrible acts of violence as the real threat here and yet in just one week uh we've seen three of attacks that were homegrown these were domestic\nAh acts of terrorism and violence so what our who is really the biggest threat to our domestic security right now Bruce\nWell two things first leads the twenty first century has turned out to be enormously in short time on any number of levels both in terms of political violence and terrorism but also in terms of an order that is rapidly\nShifting and you know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's\nThe most threat they're all threatening and they're all bad because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nRoutes I never I I have to say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and thought and then was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days would say they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's cool\nEver think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what we said earlier throughout the United states history at times of great does this of this polarization alienation we've seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war\nIn the late Nineteen century during the period of industrialization\nAnd modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another\nCertainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies I think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memory\nBut don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't a ... in terms of the violence on President but in terms of the moon that both you and brief described\nI mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant in this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing him because the number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping\nWhite supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as as loud as Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not a majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have ... we have made a lot of progress from\nWhere we were in the past but to discuss what is happening now in a way that discount be centuries and generations of this type of violence that we have seen in this

with tens of a a guy from WNYC NPR I public radio international collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nWhen American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winner of the mid term to have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level\nHere to explain more it's Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the twenty twenty census is conducted\nStates have to revisit their state legislator\nSo after the twenty twenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and redraw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional districts need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm election in the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps\nSo it's a fairly important process that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors what are you seeing as far as money concern\nIn addition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to ... there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to endear see has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gave fifty thousand dollars and supportive uh Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races certainly\nThe look we're able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups\nState laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective it was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country are in at least the vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is overlooked or misunderstood or not understood it all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically wonky [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of gene mapping and and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insider though the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the anti RC are very aware of it Denise Ross barber is
