man but according to the New York times by the time he was three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire\nAnd total the president received four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire that's according to a scathing investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper the investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents charted the financial history of the Trump family business\nAnd the extent to which Donald Trump profited off the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump\nThe report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes in total one billion that's billion with a B dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children\nAnd instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found the trumps pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJedi Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance our tax minimization that it's perfectly well within the confines of a lot and then there are parts of that but you know very significantly cross the line and we of course\nJohnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud there certainly\nParts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance our tax minimization that it's perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that but you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations work quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory um despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump\nTo help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut in the times of association they found that basically it was a shell company with a company on paper and they would mark up the costs of products as a way of transferring the money is unpack skiffs is that tax fraud\nI Believe that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nIs tax fraud and one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts from the president's father or to the president has siblings\nOne of the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's\nNineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and and normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value was probably wrong\nBut it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations done by another expert at the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nI Would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong but whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that is the sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I\nThink wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than a eleven million dollars so\nPlease over when I say tax code um who the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier families in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I\nI think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than ... eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks to is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nAn estate tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules are not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us to pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around this\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay a state tax to the wealthy pay estate tax yet significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay ... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of at state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of allies willful\nAnd you know the IRS has a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJamie Johnson where the criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago Jenny thanks for being with the
