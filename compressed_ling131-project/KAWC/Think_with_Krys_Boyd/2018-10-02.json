Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate thanks for joining us\nThank you tend to you know so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today fifty\nYears ago there was a real by student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedom for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement grew in strength and the demand became sharper and more articulate it\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students with the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during a protest meeting\nIn the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured [noise]\nThere were reports at the time that arm snipers were up in surrounding buildings

people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there in between what happened in Mexico today versus fifty\nYears ago [noise] sure but I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and the community or from the government today I think they are pouring into the streets because four years ago almost to the day\nForty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and if never showed up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president of the loop as Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party ... even the sort of dominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change NF demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too

I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we start talking about what consent looked like ... cells in our daily lives and our ... and then they

accountability looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations so often happens ... years ago or even decades ago um I thought this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own songs called the person or I just\nKnow set something up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I thought that it's definitely not

face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness and a way that that's the end goal but is it\n[noise] no I mean I'm In charge of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survive it to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgave or not or whether they want more than ... the weather they want to continue the conversation on whether they want to just\nLet it go there over the many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure\nAnd this is definitely not a building ... everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know as we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us and when we want to handle the situation than six out
