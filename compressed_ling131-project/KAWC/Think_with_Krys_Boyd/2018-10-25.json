swept up in a wave of populist leaders\nAnd for Brazilians this fall a title election comes after years of economic instability and political turbulence wholly unfit to the Brazilian writer and he joined me from Sao paolo to trace the roots of the upcoming election\nThe first moment we can find relevant would be two thousand protein when many people to to the street to prove that the government\nAt first it was a left wing protests as we tended to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime Oscar the first one the second one it when it got bigger and bigger ... it was a simulate that that the a right wing movement\nAnd then from then on the started organizing them so they went to the streets again again in two thousand Fifteen asking for do my roof says these men and then uh\nStreets against it again in two thousand Fifteen asking for do my Rousseff's impeachment and then after a while they got that\nAnd well all this structure that was against the tea now is supporting Joe you both so now do the stream right politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think it taught this extreme to the point where Los ... could potentially be elected\nWell I think it had something of a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of a population tend to fire ride thoughts I mean that just to be ten percent thoughts\nEvery last election and less Thirty years but then there was so much rage and so much hatred\nAnd there was also a media campaign against the tea and focusing lost in the corruption scandals that we're serious obviously\nBut they weren't only ... the fall and then people ... raised and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\n[noise] he's mostly not exploiting on any of the conditions that exist or social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction because well er during the the workers but the government's during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the poorest\nBut middle class the state more or less the same\nShow they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise] and this created some sort of set this faction through a great part of of a population [noise]\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that and has the support of this people even though it's his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot well\nFor the reaches not for the middle class\nI Want to read an excerpt from an essay you broach and ask you to to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote\nIt Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred so much yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bell sounding something in danger\nIn many ways clearly understands a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nDefinitely it's a great a reason for concern\nAnd well perhaps we are now in the frontline or something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case that please because there was this a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and\nBesides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point since\nStrong democracy as you have been in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the less dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\nAnd in terms of those in Brazil and Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under a ball for NATO presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because she has a very violent program for fighting crime organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nThan arming great ... of the population than giving license for police men to kill without any serious investigation\nSo we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now which is very serious\nAnd of course there will be also persecution of the aisle you beat the community because he's been talking about that's his entire career\nWomen will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality the indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land\nAnd the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we had during the dictatorship that was the suggestion of this than the activists\nHe has said things that's going to that idea but we are not sure how his planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague men and well many people don't want to see what it's called\n... says the Brazilian writer and

and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land\nAnd this ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of what it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well the owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in

a hand in sort of clawing him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of\nThe romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents you know what that courtship might've been like because it was there's something very\nI don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine that you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film\nThat it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that mean well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the\nParents of designer jeans everyone's we're rocking designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great there's a photo Matt\nYou know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days where you have to take film right actually get a developed right out of little hut that was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know to the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now\nBut I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling a story of how\nMy father would make everyone listen to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered but in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way with kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams do you think\nThat there is enough nuance I'm black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that life is I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that\nWell I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes and why marketing money okay that's\nBut Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes why marketing money okay that's very specific group of black people like these hair care products that you can sell stuff to people\nI get it but I think this sort of box that that same literate you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small\nIt doesn't fit anymore and um you look at you know my man child is can be no you know you look at this sort of new wave of\nOkay here's some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I had hoped that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming up\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um [noise] to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues or jazz\nYou know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you've got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so to me the music is the cherry on top\nIt's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop fashion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means where a nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states that was mandated that they had to buy their slaves and nice outfit so they can go to church worship a guy that white or supposedly white\nThere aren't a lot of people looked like me
