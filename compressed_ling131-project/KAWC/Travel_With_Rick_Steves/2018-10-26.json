a I had an opportunity to grow up and hear stories from some of the people who lived in these places and it really inspired a passion\nAnd especially for people our age I mean we grew up watching wider than the rifleman and the radio and boy you walk through a ghost town and you can almost imagine doc holidays stepping around the corner\nLots of history in these places and it's amazing the

you write a song about [noise]\nThe Irish remember the events and the pizza shape their history and the many traditional songs written over the lyrical look at some of the heroes of Ireland some real in some legendary we're joined now by singer happy right cat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of the public ...\nShe's with us right now and travel with Rick Steves to introduce it to some of the people that Ireland remembers and saw Kathy so good to have you here\nIt was great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of life in the context of Ireland helped music ties in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yeah Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl\nGets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous and my mother was a musician a harsh so she always had music on the\nStereo playing popping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down and also we were members of the gay the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit and that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's a it's kind of very very strong Irish coffee lately had a bit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens\nNo television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off\nEverything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like Ireland\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added to I don't want people to run off the boss throw me off\nThe bus but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning rates dogs there are songs about greed horse that there are songs about people's families there are songs about deaths in communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking\nSo everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nHeartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began of your relationship with England and uh just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries yeah you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nYou finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who side are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal it was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that ... you're Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who are actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote the song and I'd like to sing one fee now if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by ... peers Patrick Henry peers was one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people grace O'Malley who was the pirate clean environment born and fifteenth thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she's saying she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnock people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own heroes so\nShade a law that they all girl who they need to you\nKnow it's you know\nOh shit oh girl Shannon how are ya oh shit\n\nThat's just one verse so the Irish are going to save themselves yes and they're going to do to become Gaelic\nYes it's going to be the Gales not the French or Spanish and it's going to be ... and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring with the planting of that seat he says in the last of the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week after that but in summer will be the bloom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the the ... the Ira spreading out time yet as tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland yes stand which is actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America\nBy Ayman devil there to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant settled player changed the way Irish people play the fiddle his label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy right she's been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years before um rent ensembles like church ladies and she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist a decade too tight by live Ireland dot com\n'cause he was born in Detroit now she calls Ireland county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums and her performance catch on her website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about Ireland it's also a proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent and I understand that the first printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for Ireland to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very ...\nMost lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett when Ireland was starving during the great hunger\nThomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are ... they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or the this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in your welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that's sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the chicken\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after us so we're just playing our part in continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner and they'll they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yet if in would end the thought that you've got poets who would put their poetry to music something audience don't realize there's an extra dimension was a great Irish poet that might have been caught up in the music\nGates gates gates and I when I'm On the coach at the tour guide I play gates reciting his poetry because he sings us\nClear skies and human this evening Loeb around sixty Seventy degrees sunny skies tomorrow with

bigger picture every afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nIt's got all the makings of a tabloid headlines or an action movie to send up one of America's richest families travels to an exotic locale\nDisappears under those circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by chemical was it true or did he\nHas the official reports claim [noise]\nJournalist crow Hoffman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller\nThe Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one\nRetraced Rockefeller during combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about [noise] Savage Harvest a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael rocker colors tragic quest Carl good to have you back on the show\nThanks so much so that I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean now Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and went off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then\nA few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were incredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick ... sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip he vanished\nMichael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it in\nIt's hard to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around\nOur you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nHe was enamored of ... and fascinated by ads met culture and as Matt carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were\nYou know twenty three twenty four foot high a polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it and I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he ain't no got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand in Indonesia as one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top then with a Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee walk thing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff and people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one asthma was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and ah\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society what\nOne of the great ironies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents you know the most powerful family and the most powerful country in the world in and asked mad at the crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nHead hunting and you know when the as men men\nWho killed and did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise] and they consume them and there's no more\nArticulate display of of power than that so did they eat Rockefeller\nConsumed them and there's no more [noise]\nArticulate display of of power than that so did they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nNo they didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them I mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify the as mad in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed in a local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village a lesson as he wrote in his reports and he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with them and he arrived into the village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know traditional place to place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was a ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the man's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned\nOut so he gave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world Pete did\nCarl Hofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report\nToday in travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller has he investigated his disappearance ended deadly clash\nBetween cultures and the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage Harvest [noise] no I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of a fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party\nIt's a matter of um power and symbolism is that right\nYeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything on it was easier to get an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well immediate ritual is Terry somebody yeah it gets very complex but\nNo cannibalism is with in a is a sacred to act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual a stick way to actually cook the person yes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the\nBook the Rockefeller family are maintained that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nWell he was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael said you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRenee waltzing was older and wiser said you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Yuma", "day": "26"}
