on travel with Rick Steves we're learning how things work in Japan with Dr ruth economic she straddled the differences between American and Japanese culture all her life and is the author of the moon guy\nCalled living abroad Japan Ruthie also hosts tours of Hokkaido website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace [noise] hop religion that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be shouldn't do it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought he didn't resent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do that is ... nor the gods before me or or this sort of the right exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who\nWho were kinda like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else\nSo they were ... they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be the only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what is Buddhism and what is Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she told means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings to the God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images\nInto his room and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings to the God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images inching do like statues are idle or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the upper who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state of the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIt's kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals that sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to do so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time because I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's and you know like a whole each time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this song what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of sense that\nYou may have committed at temple down very slowly hundred and eight times [noise] and then as soon as midnight passed on New Year's morning people flock to the ... they'll shrine\nTo pray for health and success and\nHappy new year and by ambulance or even something to put it in your car for\nTraffic safety and so on at the sheep they'll try so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she'd do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you connect you hear a book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and really the one we're thinking about living in Japan [noise] what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on a hand in the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working\nStart their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so there isn't any changing yes\nSo the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to do that on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\nOur phone number is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from mountain Georgia he's got thanks for your call Ira how are you I'm great have you had

sorry to hear you\nKnow somebody I Will be but right now I've got other fish to fry how's it what is your favorite the memory of being a a a fan of British or television or movies and then traveling\nShark is that I ... I'm ... and I don't really care [laughter] the pressure on Iran now how do you got it worked out it seems like a small island youthful you know what are they in fact for of course that's in that are\nSo Shetland there's a a murder mystery about called Shetland is that right yeah that's\nRight and the island doesn't seem to have enough people to murder\nThey used to have a lot but they're all dead now [laughter] so this\nThis is true of all of those you can get to these places quite easily shutting induced by flights and ferries going from the mainland and everything else but that's always the cost of all of these a country like Britain has such a low manager right if you watch\n... I guess the Christie all of these you'd wonder that we don't have the highest murder rates in the world\nSo you just watch it on TV and you don't need to do it in ... maybe we should have a license\nSafety valve but Shetland these well we're going because you might want to go there because of the TV series but there's so much to see their anyway and when he would come behind it\nAnd you make a good point they seem like a long ways away but there's little puddle jumper airplanes that gets you there and a half I I just went to the arc nice in Scotland and it was so easy I Do I just decided to get myself forty eight hours out of my dinner affluent son had a great time Elizabeth did you have any other comments or or suggestions\nI didn't want to know where it would be a good place to visit our\nWilling truth [laughter] you'd have to stay on Shetland because I'm although the connections are relatively frequent see the sights of the island you'd really need to base yourself on the island but as as we were both things rules saying um you could fly and have a couple of days there", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "05"}
