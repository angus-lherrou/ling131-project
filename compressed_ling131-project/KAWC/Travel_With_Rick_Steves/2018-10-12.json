and leave it to beaver and sort of a we have enough stole Jake simplistic look at the Nineteen fifties but sort of peeling back the layers to tell us about Australia in the Nineteen fifties\nWell it would post war for us that's how we define it so there was a depression um people who are returning or not so there was a lot of loss a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche is\nA lot of them in a disappeared into the women had sort of taken I've found a better place for themselves in society and community in the workplace\nAnd it was a time of reconnecting to cultural identity I suppose there wasn't a lot of frivolous he and a celebration necessarily even though it was a seeming success um because the last threat stride in suicide rates\nSo the show starts with a woman returning from either say Mike ... Adams\nHaving being away from home for a long time and she had fought in the ... and ... a Holocaust survivor and that's all explained in the show as to how that could possibly happen to her and she makes this very well to do family on the ship on the way back\nIn accidently fooled madly in love with the um the son who\nWho are of course it's not the right match and should never bay and saw a war begins outside the war didn't between this family and this woman\nIt's really a look at where we've Bain and how far we've come about what I Love about this show and back in late that creates what he's done he's set it as a melodrama and he talks about um the ... films so he's referencing in particular genre and so it's quite heightened\nBut it's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice\nAnd racism and xenophobia and um they took the to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a straight in television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and and look at it and how how it was dealt with in that time\nAnd then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute mark too about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected and at the same time expect more in the in fact I had that sense when I saw you even when you were sailing\nFrom ah Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell that's what I had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had begun that way for a very very long time and as I say much the men left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about steroids she come way they'll say Europe and surviving a Robin broke with where she was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... in London\nAnd he's a woman who who really doesn't need to be the center of attention and yet ... actions keep putting her in the spotlight because\nShe's selfless but she she marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing at the end\nOut of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about steroids she come we don't say Europe and surviving a Robin wrote with last year was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... in London\nAnd he's a woman who who really doesn't mean to be the center of attention and yet her actions keep putting her in the spotlight because\nShe's selfless but she she marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing that to an ruffling all the fed is of course which are in the ... amazing costumes in the Nineteen fifties\nAnd there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very depressing but actually there's a lot of joy in watching that happen as someone breaks down the world so I just stay home rain\nAt a time when you come pick up a ... or send a text you have to arrive and actually have a conversation which usually means a cup of tea and some end Zach biscuits switch off one of our nation's greatest biscuits some\nMade from the ... of them send maple syrup back in the day so\nI mean certainly when I ...\nI can smell my grandmother and I can hear a voice than I can hit the radio and I remember the left over that time the kind of lost vestige of that\nAnd certainly it talked to a lot of the ... um and internationally as well it'd be like Downton Abbey because it is it's a fool absorption in another place and it's like a different world\nUm it's like traveling when I travel to Japan and I go this is like being on another planet I Love it so much because it's so different and so completely off the and that's what they should really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious filmed and wonderful acting up do you think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just missed all about the fifties or does it a challenge them to see where they are today and and and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what's so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire than sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's there's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognize for everyone\nOn and you can also horse ride that which is another beautiful thing today\nI said was talking about walking over a bridge what was that bridge
