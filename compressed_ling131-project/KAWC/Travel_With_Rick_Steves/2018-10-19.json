Kenya and he now teaches Shakespeare at Cambridge he explores the universal appeal Shakespeare in his book Shakespeare in Swahili Edwards thanks for being here thanks for having me on right now this is so fascinating to think of Shakespeare breaking out of\nWestern culture especially in the East Africa can you first of all tell us about your passion for Shakespeare in your work at Cambridge I\nHave been upset to chase bits and say you know a fairly young age by my childhood in Kenya and wasn't one of these children who had a news in the book\nThe entire time I spent my childhood or off pretending to be here as rather than reading about them a but certainly um since my teen years I've seen a difficulty of Shakespeare and and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed connect ... two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nYeah well I think a part of the story is about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock consonant\nButs what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nOn and it was translated into a wide number of uh of languages so for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type it to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century\nHad it's extraordinary culture all performance off shaped in Mumbai in nearly twenty century I at one point shake day was being performed a mall in Mumbai southern in London's West End\nAnd these were you know glory Italy irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know shake it was that was released his check for Bayh was a mad at the state has to do what's necessary to get bumped ... seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em that speak to the people who performing them in Mumbai in nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things that become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things off on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways and set nice shakes they can and has come and live in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nNow that's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly is another example of our Shakespeare sort of a appeals to people that several levels were these players when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture are they\nPlays when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa are they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining or on their level or are they just straight translations of Shakespeare like we would not\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again is a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Kenya as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps they are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and I'll take that's going to speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know that hamlet settle on mood called battlement ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and again spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\nIn order to kill the which kind of tone or into because that's how again sport or less sorry\nUh that's how Patrick dollars at the end of ... so it's kind of wonderfully fertile reimagining of the play and one that pact out houses I fear says\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on shacks in a fledgling city of Mumbai on you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say\nI mean you're focuses East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and I got to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\n... they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he's used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission rate to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people\nHe's translated into Swahili he's you know he performed by the Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been colonial over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah say Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to and it's one which hopefully capture has a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also in the region was government as a kind of single entity by the British colonies so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission raised landed on the coast which is west what he has spoken Swahili is\nKind of very Arabic influenced to language and\nAs the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved in and out of them is just\nHappens to be a convenient language for the colonial overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nSo it it is the legacy of colonialism but on the other hand it's also a legs\nAnd because of the British imperialism so widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of ... but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all the games are African culture within one of these countries in Africa\nOr now you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is nineteenth century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in this story is a ... cold ed wood ... who was the mission ... Central Africa descent now for Britain\nHe arrived in ... in Eighteen sixty seven and he is the machinery and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to lead to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of time\nTrying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili\nHe is a translation of challenge to marry lambs tales from Shakespeare cold ...\nPrinted on that little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania if a ... century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and\nMissionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a you're a missionary uh you believe that won the gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty that allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you ... if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate have that's\nAs we can this American Life I'm pleased to present here on the Brooklyn Academy of music up or how they [noise]\nDon't but it's true stories like we always do this time for him to do a musical turned into opera [noise] also\nSplit among some years later like perfectly or even married for ... ... ... than [noise]\nGuys meant that exceeds [noise]\nAnd that was certainly me or I travel with Rick ... guys missing [noise]\nThank you [noise] ...\nMore than a decade exploring Iceland and focusing especially on cyber music scene [noise]\nHe's fall Kevin at a team from K. XP radio in Seattle heads of Reykjavik to broadcast live from the Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled the each corner the island nation that has made many local friends he's tapping their studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destination to anywhere these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us and thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crude to broadcast live\nWhy would you choose Iceland and wipe you've gone back for so many years in a row well\nReason is they have an incredible music scene has some ... a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding and discovery and great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but to the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point to to the K XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music can get to understand each other's through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller\nMusic and get to understand each other through various different types of music and you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far away\nAnd there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art it can be music ... and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's an international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing\nWith local people absolutely and and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark some times I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformational is is such a a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and and I'll tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called cigarettes and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to us here in the [noise]\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this Mueller that came from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listened to some music for ...\nIf I Want to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that you have the music is sometimes so unfair you want to be translated that you want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed yes music and sometimes\nIt inside travel okay so you're organizing this now in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular\nYeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again I don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter]\nYou didn't want to go back because you thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yeah if I go back with a TV crew and it didn't come out where the magic I was your last year was incredible do it again yeah and sometimes it doesn't so\nI did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in us actually going to Iceland the broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting location trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now in every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together in Iceland\nWell it's a bit of both now where the music festival we broadcast from its called ice on the airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic and Nordic bands new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international ban sevens and gathering of people from all over the world\nAnd new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international band so it was a gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now though musically because of the Internet is were all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally ...\nThat's a a boon for music culture and internationally and it's probably a bit benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage of like they might [noise]\nLand of Byron I punches way above its weight as a source for innovative contemporary music\nOur guest right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ...\nShe's program director of Seattle's noncommercial K. E. X. P. radio\nHeads a music post on a weekday afternoon ...\nKevin sharing what he travels to the Iceland Airwaves festival every November in Reykjavik the hair wet it's many bands and musicians are up to each year\nYou'll find links to the festival hand to Kevin radio show at ... dot com slash radio\nKevin when we're talking about this listener's experienced this attendees experience this music appreciation experience [noise]\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences say\nIn pubs or in in wonderful beer gardens and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues in sometimes not even pennies because any space that could be a cool place to host a band becomes one but they've got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility\nThat is where are all I've been there that is a matter of pride for Reykjavik it really is the concert hall standing right every Kennedy being capital seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall yeah\nI think all the stone as Isabel ... definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most illiterate nations uh I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere on earth and has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative genres\nAnd lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase a because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity man that's\nIs a great question and music journalists have been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of ice on the on my show or all of her grandson and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got geothermal energy and the the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset of Iceland is the creativity of the people\nAnd he sort of tie dead into again the legacy where the lineage of the the saga is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Yuma", "day": "19"}
