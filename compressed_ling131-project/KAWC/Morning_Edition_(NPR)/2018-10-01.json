but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future is of many kids by finding out those ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunch the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improved those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back\nIn twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced a little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it's singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively targets\nSegregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of pure math median income in Charlotte\nAnd a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg school he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations\nI think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership Charlotte's effort\nTo improve upward mobility is already taking shape et cetera field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric heartfelt says the schools students\nAre mostly black and Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body this larger minority\nThat's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut when in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord said that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to make it really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allow the liquor say yet I was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte has a fifty million dollar bond issue for affordable housing on November ballot\nRoss chatty says he hopes the opportunity atlas will help communities across the country revived\nThe American dream in their local

D. Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes with a complete surprise male not this year these things are on just about everybody shortly OK so\nNot such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells they\nCame across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if you could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may her now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word taught school ... yesterday and know that him oh hundreds\nAnd the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who's winning word type school ... yesterday and\nKnow that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nWhen example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective targets\nHuh fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these new therapy that's what one really wants to know it went\nAnd that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in his recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nAnd ... counties it's six o'clock\nIn the county library

reminder to get the shot\nBefore Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News okay\nIf you're looking for a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited duration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nSimply another choice for consumers for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people\nWho think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck to bless met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them all\nPeople have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Allison Kojak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for

those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government have their own flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would say\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians that if we don't administer\nRamallah origin then or now blues are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd a thing where the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse of their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best arrangement we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\n[noise] uh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism and and that was back\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good um we don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about um uh terrorists in one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say\nWhy don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to uh why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack because we weren't at the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nInternationally final thing minister because I Know your time is very briefly\nI Hope you got the irony of what I said\nI understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because he would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support in Israel have had a bipartisan support in and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful bond\nThere there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you've seen\nThat we could have agreements and disagreements with previous administrators was for example we had a\nYou know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time\nWe signed an animal you are an animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you have a basic agreement about the importance of our

EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin where we'd like to think America is the land of equal opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future is as many kids by finding out the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlook but we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues\nTool called the opportunity outlook but we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced the little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility\nIt singled out segregation as a key obstacle and now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have up here right now it's just kind of share math median income\nIn Charlotte and a lot of Williams from the Chinese team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's screener blew it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such feel middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric towards felt says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school\nIn Charlotte to have a student body this larger minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now in an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics here and a shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut we're in the coming years at the change has started to look more like the neighborhood\nThere's another challenge here beyond\nThis majority black and brown now but when in the coming years to change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge share beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe such feel neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may as soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity atlas should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us around making really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allow we could look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has

from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin this year's Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine will be given to two scientists who's discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThe Nevada family how either to warn the two thousand a Nobel Prize you see all the ... going to shame on how who ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in Studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going I took good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist is now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... hunt Joe at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise itself not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists\nDo well I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them as the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case it's observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Tim Allen send the other scientists who is winning word ... yesterday and now that him\nA hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime target for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about it was a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective targets\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the scientists made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot of that and you know therapy how effective are these new therapy that's what everyone really wants to know\nIt went and that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma and his recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nThe service of Arizona western college were more than forty five years trusted news for the pause and ... counties good morning thanks for listening I'm chip strictly

Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News okay if you're looking for a\nCheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited duration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage [noise] more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Allison Hausman with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something\nAnd they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want\nAnd for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to your medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage that's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules\nThey don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the SEA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met so people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to
