to know from the decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce it's here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask me to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France it's Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to\nBasically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including ... that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two

targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor

radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea that started the war invading the U.S back south the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the Arabs most famous general\n\nDouglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war and read the turning point I was a fire started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially an intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but didn't intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nOrdered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of

Division his name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario for encirclement he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on you\nKnow this is Hector kept Retta who received the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night you may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for I've never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than fought their way is sixty miles to the evacuation for devote enough\nSnow mountain passes they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one

Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered he had to hide out in a house in\nSeoul he hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruin says they took it back\nThe capital city of media\nVolunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in North Korea ...\n... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're gonna have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they've gotten into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it\nTo the south

now Dr Levi suck of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I was a mockery\nCame at the same time that the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check is and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described President Trump fall\nBus with sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh catch that\nThis is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not it's a criminal sexual assault investigation\nAnd that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police were following it a little bit uh some more than others that Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas\nHe's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nRebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem and the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or ...\nInjured which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom Trump blade says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he hopes to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances scaring from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years\nLooking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this the best occasion\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nThis is K.

battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nRecalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work I go I think here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa ... from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee failed to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process at the end and how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents and sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty that Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas apt to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this\nControversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice ... forge us up to a chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first appeared before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question it's interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove it Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nA dead end the Senate failed to go along and

molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube\nBasically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic in trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did you took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know by\nUsing evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from of NPR science

under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division his name as general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the

kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his

I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the

the foundation\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nRecalled them earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask\nCokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work I go I said here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that presidents and sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we don't have the means\nIt's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a forge us up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg which were withdrawn because either legally smoke marijuana but he said on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you removing Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Rand off in the house of representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase and so this nasty and then since hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nAnd so this nasty and this is hardly know a dead end the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth
