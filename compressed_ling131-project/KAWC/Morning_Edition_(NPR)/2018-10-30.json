Inskeep\nA group of migrants is moving slowly through Mexico toward the U.S border this as President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand troops to the border\nAt rallies for Republican candidates the president has explicitly put the distant caravan at the center of the election campaigns and elections seamy continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people and the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nThe president was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles outside the United states\nWith that said there is a group of several thousand migrants and there are varying descriptions with the group size and purpose so let's check on the latest facts\nYesterday on this program we heard from Mexico's ambassador to the United states who said the group was smaller than otherwise reported about thirty five hundred people he said was some of them accepting asylum offers to stay in Mexico\nWe've next called journalist David ... who was recently with the group to ask what the proper number could be\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number that was given at the time the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home voluntarily mirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is based because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nUh okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred a according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many are truly determined to pass on to the un\nOkay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many are truly determined to pass on to the United states given that they have this Mexican offer of asylum\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were wanting to work in northern Mexico\nYou mentioned that you did not encounter very many people accepting this offer of asylum the Mexican authorities have given a fairly substantial number of people who have accepted the offer it could be that you would not have run into those people because they've already left the caravan\nThat's possible I mean one thing I I came across for example in in one city the city of weeks that was closer to the border with bought them all the people [noise]\nUh I remember the mayor saying that they had eight people who'd accepted trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and among that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise]\nUm [noise] but ... it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than a usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question that everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty [noise]\nAh and also family reunification so there's a combination of people that their parents or their children are in the United states and they want to reach them and see them again they hadn't seen them for years in some cases that the appeal of the U.S to you they will face when you American or the the ability to make
