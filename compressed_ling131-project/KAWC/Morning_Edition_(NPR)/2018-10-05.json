Romero of cake you weedy begins his report with a sign of just how troubling the conditions were\nThere have been at least seven suicide attempts and less than a year at the privately run at Atlanta immigrant processing facility and deaths uh thirty two year old man killed himself by hanging in twenty Seventeen and three detained people died in part because of medical neglect since twenty Fifteen\nThat's all according to them factors report\nDoing an unannounced best that inspectors found health and safety violations including a disabled man who was confined to his wheelchair for nine days and nights news says made out of bed sheets and detainee cells that could aid suicides and people waiting weeks or months to see a doctor\nThe medical attention as very low standard\nMyers thirty one he spent six months that at all until I was just released this summer we're not using his last name because he fears it could hurt his asylum case\nThat just came to the point where we just were not even putting in medical requests because we said what for\nA spokesperson for the California attorney general says they'll consider the federal inspectors findings as they pursue their own first as our investigation of immigration facilities\nCalifornia gained authority to inspect federal detention centers and the state holding nearly five thousand detainees from a twenty Seventeen law authored by state senator Ricardo Lara\nThe federal government owned record is validating are concerned\nThe Trump Administration has sued to overturn that law in court but ... says the new report gives legal ammunition to California\nMakes it much more important for California or have a bigger role in investigating what is really happening in the center\nThe California attorney general's review is not expected until march of next year\nAt least ... with the inland coalition for immigrant justice\nIs concerned about detainees another lentil now the lives of these people are pretty much a sort of helps detainees filed grievances with immigration and Customs Enforcement has pretty much gone over that's what a report from homeland security itself found earlier this year\nIce does not adequately follow up on problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect that people will start filtering in and giving speeches and I will also see many speeches that are part of the debate that comes after the cloture vote this ... this necessary procedurals out because some senators are saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final content\nAltered this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh's does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now\nWants his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done but it isn't written in stone so there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line um I Will say that that like I said is quite rare we are I think some people including a you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... ... not normal on there\nSeizures and and what we're watching play out

that there are barricades set up and there are more ... than I have seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how lie all the other side as well still getting just the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to ah or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott a David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say

the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nVi interviewed can more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirms what we've Senate investigators already concluded that is is there is nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and ... the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever\nBeing good enough to\nSatisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington\nWho staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh

Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and through the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook\nRemains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nSort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this Nina Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were a chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh and that it's time to confirm this man Dianne Feinstein speaking right now saying that this is a judge willing to disregard president who believes that the president of the United states is above and outside the law\nAnd a man filled with aggression we'll continue our

nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows therefore\nVotes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that\nThat's the way from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress is here and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows therefore key\nVotes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor and in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear or in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half\nReally Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central to the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation\nIt is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nita Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side\nAt but don't be fooled by their\nBoring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist\nHe has done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the court or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated was a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been

everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president\nA clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats consider this nominated with an open mind it would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for a delay those fell flat there were rows distortion of judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... ... women hospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThe old\nPlayers weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus\nOpinions we are sworn test\nBut here's the problem\nThe old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nOpinions\nWhere our sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses Raul stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was fair amount of president they owe taxes weren't working one going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said\nWell we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen\nInto political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and coughing up through the Democratic side of the judiciary committee's\nSomehow mysteriously found its way\nInto the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committed collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence\nNot know it was produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry or from anywhere else nothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues and of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it right now\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one if vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes this advances too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out that this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happened living United let's give a listen\nTo some of that let's bring that up and give a listen Moran\nIs Murkowski Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called and it's more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... with lots\nSenator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happy living United let's give a listen to some of that\nLet's bring that up and give a listen\nMoran is Murkowski Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote at their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... with lots of last minute drama if you know your ... vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that there is that it is very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to the confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for the addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\nIt's ... to me it's the Udall\nIs there a Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow Racine that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is I don't know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote go until they banged the gas\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as they know who just at the last moment does something different and we're on a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference whether we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes [noise]\nThis is K.

political battles in recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell looks like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base\nThat frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy as him gap as a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're on a months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters are ... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of power party\nNormally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters and be more amped up then the people that are at a fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down ...\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election\nThis is special coverage from NPR News ...\nFor listening to K.

Kevin ... as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's did medical ... can start us off year than this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything that surprised to hear the medical well\nI think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she has shown over the years this is somebody who won ... election state wide as a writing candidate ... the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allowed ... Alaska ... well\nSo fifty one to forty nine is the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican ... can start us off you than a segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate to beat the odds of doing that anywhere or nearly impossible now allow much Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because she's a very well known named it yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of\nEither their pockets with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when\nWe say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state\nWell let me last time that I'm not a fix with the ... and I mean that not in a Democrat that pro democratic thing I mean that as somebody who would ... going on in their voting rights go against their big so when you think about\nUm what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nThese three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an outright still be fifty votes would be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't that a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing for somebody to be promoted to the highest\nIt's just another reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue and then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty vis a vis a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe better is pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when\nUm minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even a hearing any Mitch McConnell says ... said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm\nA a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the effect of moderate he picked a moderate liberal or a ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J. one of my hand whole month and that\nThat you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening to this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also a veteran on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick your starting point if you say that one sided something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're on\nAnswers that I've just I Wonder if they lose their head which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on the ... where you started the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way no it depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some similarities here and for\nTo want to set for when the story started to go wrong\nYes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when

News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United states senators voted fifty one forty nine to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nTo the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators whose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kevin all or at least have to vote no against a are on on on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes uh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but you give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still where this has been covering Susan Collins a watch\nWhat evidence do we have to go on the way she's leaving will\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of bet the device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot pensions there's your how good yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns\nAbout how ... how much she would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a colon and for or against um [noise] do off and wound up forcing\nA Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March to dominate when Dick Cheney had to come down and break a
