I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon\nWhiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum shelf though I'm so shell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger the sailors more than half their market maybe over ... from the\nSoldiers are still are but yes the I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a NAFTA and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile of receipts and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem um but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts at slate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it [noise] so you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you know have people that have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nCity we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that asked um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nUh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah\nAnd while you know we're kind of collateral damage to you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an issue yet\nYou mean an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows will probably mean Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he tells you understood exactly that that would that they should be for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks so that that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David team which they can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better making a\nBeginning a next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so they'd be perverted a blast for years suddenly if they started looking and from my standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generations ferret\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers

substantial costs but it's also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so with good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your finger

Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump says he the each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well he\nDoes but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribally nature part isn't in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out of versus them President Trump put it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same grass he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this well\nHe was I mean and a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talked about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has a right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this at the long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and have kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nIn observance of Hispanic heritage month the family's

he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you've got an artist yeah there are days or haven't come up and running out time during that time\nStill have a call but by and large sums of improvements that when she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was putting to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say wait hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu age a lack of immunity\nFor Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nAnd how it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit go to for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months she started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at him\nI was laying awake at nights I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the sidewalk outside of the NPR headquarters you may have to be careful not to

are concerned enough about injuries that they're not allowing them at all\nWhen they enter the factor of transportation that's also entering the sector public health so it becomes a different ball game and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely\nIn San Francisco Juilliard as part of the city's injury prevention collaborative which is collecting data on a split or injuries are they happening at particular intersections our people fracturing gold or sprinting ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the trends are and where the low hanging fruit are\nAnd the trauma surgeon Juilliard has seen the dangers but she also sees the potential because San Francisco is a city dealing with a lot of car traffic and so was Portland\nAnd have many more thousands of jobs many more thousands of residents were not going to be building many more thousands of St\nJohn ... is a spokesperson for Portland's bureau

at home\nBut Portland wants to make sure these innovations meet all of the city's transportation golds moving people efficiently cutting emissions and making each trip as safe as possible\nAt the same time we're seeing are rising\nI mean all of the city's transportation goals moving people efficiently cutting emissions and making each trip as safe as possible\nIf at the same time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint that we think is a good one I don't know and we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want are rising injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign\nBut you only have to look at the scooters going by to see that this is a big change cars and scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and physicians will get a better sense of scooter dangerous as the data come in over the next few months\nIn the meanwhile good safely bore you could always look for NPR News I'm Deena Prichep in Portland, Oregon\nSupport for your

Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel it's no\nCoincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world trade sources are the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum show them I'm show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCountries so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nJust to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger the sailors more than ...\nSales have been out pacing your domestic sales as well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\nSoldiers are still are but yet they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements that they will ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if that starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and we'll\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people that you've converting some scotch do remain bourbon drinkers or you take your profits back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious as the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nUh I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue\nDo you mean an issue like an election yeah it had to come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he tells you understood exactly that that's what they say she could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that I guess it's the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that\nWould bar but you've got to make it here in American if you want to sell you better make in Kentucky\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generation spirit\nGregory Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael

hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so with good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult

you think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades an estimated eighty thousand Americans died and a thirty nine year old St Louis man was almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurrently hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this

association\nTo the elderly and the young not to somebody who's health in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you've got in your hand in hand wringing our hands are not like am I\nStill have a call but by and large sums of improves Jones who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors who are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at him\nI was laying awake at nights I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm
