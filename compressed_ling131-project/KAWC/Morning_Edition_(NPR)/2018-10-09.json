officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed my whole way to vice minister of public security was Julian Kong highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing month from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for ...\nWell even before this happened China's use of it are all under amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were yours are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with among is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceeding this isn't an effort to save time and

feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as\nEffective in the courtroom for my client unless my client stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and
