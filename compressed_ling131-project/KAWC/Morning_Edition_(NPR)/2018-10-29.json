elected a new president ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy the young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as homophobia\nIs rainy on it he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a cold or senior last night which is a Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are actually the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president in Paris\nMost of the people are especially the poor vehicle them minority\nBecause both concern and excitement over Brazil new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks\nYou welcome now we are more about social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking

going in that what you're proposing huh well I run into I'm ... and here's the thing he answered the bad speech\nHate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats she says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nForeigner thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may now for Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed a certain group and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line as we are free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional frame or intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible

little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government on and so she

Janet Winston goes to the doctor she fills up on gas impacts a sandwich and to the services and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile fries\nWinston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drives six hours one way to temperate healthcare just south of San Francisco I had this rash\nThat wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was it she and like read the like weeds and she made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all of the things that I had reacted to live bomb near ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBend a pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement usually found in beauty products Basset traits and some aerosol they put into a tiny plastic capsule many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substance that they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nDidn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nA statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required

insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tried to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than ... patients being left was to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I walked into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nAnd that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting the five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWith a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nPlace to live well no the bay area it's an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert at\nAnd the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health

fortunate that some people can't tell that I'm trans\nSo sometimes I can just resign\nElections officials in Fulton County where Atlanta is said poll workers aren't supposed to check for gender but every county trains coworkers differently there is a workaround for gender markers getting a passport because the federal government does not require the surgery that's another hurdle though and costs time and money\nChristian O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride at Georgia judge rejected her name change even though she's been living as a woman for years\nIt's going to be really difficult to save up any money would suck 'cause like I Love to have a name that actually matches when I go by and like I Love to have a gender like or that match what I Am\nBecause of that

deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain failed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the ... candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promised to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a load of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to report is about the need for the future president\nCole voted an off duty read to help out of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home and\nHe's really on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a ... or senior last night which says Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves

later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert

lovely image at the end of the story of this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand\nKaiser Health news and she spoke to a ...\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area it's an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert in the piece sets that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places they might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport
