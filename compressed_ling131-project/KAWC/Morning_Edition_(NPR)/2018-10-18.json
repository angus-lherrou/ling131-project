may be getting more fired up now but there was already plenty of democratic fury almost two years worth of it and democratic strategist Andy bars things his party's anger has much more staying

Kavanaugh controversy send them on the Democratic candidate doesn't sound outraged cinema has focused a lot of her rhetoric around process like the FBI investigation affords claims\nWhen I learned that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed as I think many Americans were so I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a decision that's a far cry from other Democrats who have emphasized that they believe Kavanaugh had assaulted forward right now the races in a dead heat polling shows that send them a slight lead on Sally has narrowed in the last couple of weeks Republican strategist John Seton think Kevin all played a part in that trend\nReally what I think it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize got a center

immigration and the economy Danielle Kurtzleben NPR News\n[noise] a federal regulator has publicly criticized large cell phone carriers for being slow to restore service in the areas most devastated by hurricane Michael NPR's Camila Domonoske has the story\nEver since hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle survivors have been trying to get in touch with their families for some it's been a real struggle cell phone signals went down after the storm hit last Wednesday and stayed down from many customers\nHorizon in particular had lingering outages Florida State officials called the company out for lagging behind competitors\nAfter days of complaints new numbers on when they showed just over half the cell towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning\nThere's no doubt run a more positive track\nMatthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticize the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because there's still a ways to go when we can't have any ... in the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path or left worrying about loved ones they can't reach well residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies\nThe FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage after Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress and the most devastated areas\nWe don't disagree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she says varieties and slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic and unprecedented for the biggest problem is not cell towers but the fiber optic cables that run to those towers\nThe storm passed just happened to go right in a critical area where the fiber it was late and it was just an incredible amount of ...\nAnd it's not just damage from the initial storm as clean up is under wave rising as having to fix new damage to those fiber optic cables\nYou have thousands of recovery workers you have to re remove all happening you have a lot or store work that that could just have an accidental cut and the area that we've already repaired and that we have to circle back to make that second repair\nMany people around Panama City still don't

protective of religious liberty and then the real work that they're doing is only protecting religious liberty rights of those who are religious conservative and\n... and how is important well it's important to remember that if the Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia um we're selling Saudi Arabia um it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to

the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator\nMm\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week is he wouldn't bears some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame if the GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president and why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nAnd horror Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for Sunday's vote for me to receive is they vote for me remember the\nOld man our agenda to\nAmerica great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nShort pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama moved approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're both public and incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election trying to make it more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with a greater
