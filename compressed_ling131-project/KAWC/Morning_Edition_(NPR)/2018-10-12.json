of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nAnd parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my case this one what do we know about pastor Brunson and the charges

was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants\nThere are but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants and this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there's some who've been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president ... to one of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then in this year he was transferred to house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for his release a basically ever since he was detained\nWhat the court said about why he was being released today well the court\nActually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years the prosecutor to pretend\nAh but at the same time the judge has ruled that Brunson shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a in part taking his health into consideration of the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movement to have been lifted\nAnd he is now free to leave the country are you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest Annette upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever

decision is also a big relief for turkey in President ... uh he's struggling to hold the economy together the currency is way down the inflation is soaring\nOr these sanctions from America on aluminum and steel and on cabinet ministers have added to the economic pain [noise] um and now turkey has every expectation that those punitive measures when there'll be eased er lifted once pastor Brunson is

Wuerl\nAre basically portraying the decision the pope made as one or that was made reluctantly with the ... cardinals will have the heart of a pasture and could have defended himself more ah with that the pope was allowing him to resign basically to allow the church in Washington won't work\nOr to look for new leadership in after these revolutions is ...\nVery interesting because there was a report

the U.S in Turkey\nRuns in his lived in Turkey for two decades and in two thousand and sixteen he was arrested along with tens of thousands of other people after a coup attempt he spent most of that time in jail before being allowed house arrest in July\nAnd parents Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul Peter I know I told my case this one would we know about pastor Brunson and the charges against him well\nHe's lived for a long time and his mirror in western Turkey's about fifty years old he ran a small evangelical church there\nAre but then as you noted in September twenty sixteen he was arrested charged with aiding terrorist groups are both Kurdish militants end this cleric that turkey blames for that twenty sixteen failed coup attempt\nUm there are some who have been arguing that Brunson was basically caught up in this massive purge\nOf air to once suspected enemies president rid of ... of turkey and in fact he was held at first in jail and then and this year he was transferred to house arrest in late July he's always denied the charges a there's been speculation that turkey was hoping to trade Brunson for some Turks being held in us jails\nA Washington's been pushing for Israelis are basically ever since he was detained\nWhat did the court say about why he was being released today\nWell the court actually issued a conviction or with a sentence of just over three years the prosecutor desperate ten\nBut at the same time the judge has ruled that runs in shouldn't serve anymore prison time than he already has a in part taking his health into consideration\nOf the court also lifted judicial controls on Brunson that means restrictions on his movements have been lifted and he is now free to leave the country are you know there were thoughts this might have happened earlier this year the White House thought they had a deal after President Trump spoke with the Turkey's president\nUh but at that point he was only move from prison to house arrest and that upset the White House pressure's been ratcheting up ever since uh there's been sanctions back and forth and there's no doubt that with the shaky economy here turkey really wanted to put this dispute behind them\nI mean the interesting thing here is how involved President Trump and vice president Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have all been in this case why was it such a big priority for them well\nThe administration is well known for a close ties to the evangelical Christian community in the U.S are certainly a vice president Pence secretary state Mike Pompeo a well known devout Christians\nUh this is sure to pleased that part of Trump's constituency ah also on the plus side for the U.S they're not actually trading anyone for brunch and it was a matter of putting on sanctions
