things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nIn her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then\nYou don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom in wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists\nHad bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics he says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules but down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe\nSenior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics he says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe next three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars will be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes the U.S a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper places to build up mobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offer that some of the labor gains from the deal ...

from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the FBI is broadening its investigation into Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nBehalf of his number one in the class\nBut I thought no no no no no no not this I'm going to I'm going to go on no I'm going to answer I'm going to\nTalk about my ... year mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still\nCome off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious and her retelling of what happened to her\nTracer has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women think are\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger\nAnd it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats to put the hat you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do\nThe intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the put the hat you know a bunch of women getting together and there is a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then\nMe to do you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example\nWhat historically was so threatening about women banker well in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation\nAnd who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women [noise]\nYou referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard lousy enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement\nAnd then when the me too movement Iraq's I think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased as the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women to anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks in the past ... years\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination\nTheir experience of the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women to anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years and then we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so as women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service\nTo a progressive partisan agenda not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister is the author of the book good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger is out today\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety who didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deepen the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded booting argues it couldn't compass anyone for any offense that he says will tip the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ... and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there is it the impact on plea deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color in the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain\nYou're just giving them a whole other mechanisms to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color ... poor people worse or there's various factors that they use risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist\nFan of the notes that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges this new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should be I don't think they should read people quickly incarcerated ending\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say they will be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court as soon as it takes effect next year Eric Westervelt NPR News San Francisco this is NPR News\n\nThis is K.

before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I was on loan on no no no no I'm going out there so I'm going to a car oh my God oh no I'm not sure I'm going to talk about my ... year mocked me one\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still\nCome off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious and her retelling of what happened to her ... has\nBeen exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger\nAnd it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there is a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women banker well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color\nDan correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who has been the leaders and the leading fingers at so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces in Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea\nThat sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand and six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise] that's\nTrue but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years and then\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger is out today\n[noise]\n\nNow

the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded booting argues it couldn't compete with anyone for any offense that he says will tilt the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder SP ten now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons\nOr whether the person accused has a prior history or under this law prosecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there is it the impact on plea deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect\nBut she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or do you notice that discretion to detain or release pre trial

insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system\nMarshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you exactly\nAnd if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get her health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hard ball negotiating and was she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case she had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape I\nWonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nSo does there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price it took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals\nShe called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning
