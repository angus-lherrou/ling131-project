elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the old in the head a faith based approach to mid term elections I always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nDepart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact\nThat state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense um when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majority and Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up\nOn the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want the drawing you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right\nWell I Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local represented that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system women districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system but if you\nDrew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical but what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the state\nHad different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical but what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country how if at all do\nYou advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump the\nState legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is to understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand test on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand I team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for our way of I think they're going to be extraordinarily\nDisappointed would you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government and I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focus on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most Bush of member station ... has more [noise]\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look\nIt's been so turned off by flooding around filthy even when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they're going to use for drinking and food for half [noise] but you can probably guess what happened next and I'm ...\n... ... yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it inconvenient at this point but I keep thinking about you

note the city of San Antonio scent of a water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin and worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years it just never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nBritain as there is is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf it loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nSays if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up more silt and the river could last days beyond that\nAppreciate

of this story but we do know that it's happening and we're going to bring you up to date and what we do now with NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan good morning the morning how much is the secret service saying well\nThey are saying a whole lot right now and this is something that really is just breaking news um they have sent out a statement at this point than what they are saying is that a secret service intercepted too suspicious packages one was addressed to Hillary Clinton at her home in Westchester County New York that one was discovered late last night\nAnd then early this morning or the secret service uh intercepted a second package that was addressed to block Obama here in Washington DC so before President as a home here in Washington right and what the ...\nService uh intercepted a second package that was addressed to Brock Obama here in Washington DC\nFor president as a home here in Washington right\nAnd what the Secret Service is saying is that both packages were immediately identify during routine screening as potential explosive devices or they say that neither Clinton or Obama ever received the packages they weren't in their hands they weren't in their houses but they were addressed to them that's as as as far as they got\nA the secret service is working with the FBI with uh the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives I'm as well as state and local law enforcement or try to figure out as much as they can't\nLeave added something meaningful here because there are a lot of different things that could be in a suspicious package I'm Sorry to say but they're saying potential explosive devices that particular kind of threat here which brings us to this other threats something was discovered being sent to George Soros what was that\nWhy

away\nYou know the old in the\nHead a faith based approach to mid term elections I always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact\nThat state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time high you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYou have a one seat majorities and a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding or what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance\nA number of other states are quite close further compounding or what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up\nOn the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want the dry you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere were some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local represented that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system but if\nYou drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC ... Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country how\nIf at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state
