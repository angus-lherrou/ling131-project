since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve um\nDiminution um we had set it over\nAnd over that it's important for us the justice has gotten out of the six thousand UCD women who were abducted by I said we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one as a woman to\nBe punished for the crimes they committed against using the women have and we hope to see them in court in public I think it is easy\nTo see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case it twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot less to do what is next for you

calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes\nBut even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes find yourself frustrated\n... new ... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard that's what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of women are the victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the

curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its founder Kim ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that they individually but taking smells that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along background\nTo the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested on one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the growth of Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like the CEO of local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people have the feeling that something's gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThe condition is known as the cutest lasted ... or a U.S and for short it can start with symptoms that just to be I Lived and difficulties following the CDC has confirmed sixty two cases and the last few months mostly in young children since\nThe CDC began tracking the disease four years ago I told all of three hundred and eighty six cases have been concerned one case with a seven year old boy and his mother Susan ... says her son came down with an ear infection this was back in the fall of two thousand fourteen\nSo I took him to the pediatrician and she put him on a antibiotic\nBut within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back legs he became extremely lists are jak and went downhill quickly\nHe liked total control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have a healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it was beyond a horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort\nAntibiotic but within a few days Evan complained of
