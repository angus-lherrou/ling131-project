[noise] yeah [noise]\nWell as you remember the first trip that Trump made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated literally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel\nIs closer or both to Trump er and er and Jared Kushner and mama been summoned the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him\nTo allow human rights abuses at a in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans will on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nUm for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen I'm assuming it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened

economy remains basically healthy overall that is the message that Trump in South is trying to stand after yesterday's big drop in prices the White House put out a statement saying the economic

case those\nNew jersian [noise] who gave me the benefit of the house a justice\nDepartment prosecutors had accused ... of taking gifts trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors

Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage this\nRelationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him\nTo allow a human rights abuses at uh in in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just of a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkers soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the meeting\nWe and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans will on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies conflict brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen 'em sit it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who are opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be\nA real problem for the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians on the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nIn the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship
