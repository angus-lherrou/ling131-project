Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about it the focus was instrumental in politics and they lash\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went in to find on the move to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge fund in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but I'm just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked on sustainable famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound losing to the German deutsche mark\nAnd one person's right\nThe bank of England couldn't keep the British pound losing to the German deutsche mark and when the person's right or the pound collapse or may not through for sure and the u._k. economy are descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other European countries where his finance ... he had a clear\nPolitical puppets which was to build our lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but the switch came in two thousand trade when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get out the vote courses that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked and the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is learning the the credit of sorrow and his allies have picked him up to it\nWhy does George Soros in particular become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in talked isn't just because he has so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding rushing the birth actually is for them to be a fool the open society Institute He's very open about it he ... about where the ... or so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics you say he shot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nWhere a judge finance is a portrayed\nAs the shot or if it goes through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition well what do people in his native hungry think of Soros he was\nA hero or early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books and a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much sign to\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris parents it's gotten a tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing your hair is a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine\nThere isn't a Clinton a professor of political science at Meredith College says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from the salon or they still see that prices went up all it would've been inconceivable two decades ago for a Republican president me become into that district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political finds that I mean you can almost see the county line the shift between you know the Democratic signs were on one side of the county line then you move into another county and more rural county and all of a sudden it's strong country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask how commissioner ray Gasper sense\nIsn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where\nThe view of the political trend line depends on who you ask how many commissioner ray Gaspar ... says the area that sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected a Democrat and when you see just party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state it turning blue\nWe have a hundred and ... and ... percent or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\nWell any Republican chairman ... seat says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party\nTo the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump certainly could be the clothing pitch for Republicans who want to keep at least the ninth congressional district from turning blue healthy now NPR News I'm Kenny North Carolina\nThis is NPR News\nI'm Eric later this week on science friday we traveled to the moon and back with Neil

twenty\nFive percent tariff slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price of ... and we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on\nThis and the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariffs impact but ... says that's not a real sex but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming out [noise]\nThat's a key cos elevator enrolling to Iowa sees Web cranks open the hopper on a semi to let soybeans cascade into a pet from there there'll be conveyed to a nearby storage\nThan Iowa State add a condom is Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable price was out there but that means we're going to have to have this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of fighting from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to kill them into the world market they bought from Vermont so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans hit the band for NPR News I'm

Martin and I'm Noel King good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she got the Diana Ross and I felt\nShe wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like that got races on hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she said it was a white man to\nTell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty or the CNN Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it is though was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a stretch\nPeriod focusing on a does though was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was willing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nUh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a criminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of a African American relations with police officer she of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things\nOver the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about uh what she thought was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's collie and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is\nReally interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments say something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuser former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues and that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there\nUh because uh she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David you bet ...\nFriday

C. one person is now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare the Justice Department will hold a news conference later this afternoon to share more details\nNow this news comes on follows the discovery of two more potentially threatening packages this morning one of them was addressed to new ... New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know that the person now in custody well not much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background\nPersonnel in custody well not much a law enforcement source told me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone we also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police searched a male facility what were they looking for\nLast night authorities were searching a package sorting facility and Florida and open ... near Miami the operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility in through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV and Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case\nWell as local police I'm In the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to and there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right yes in Virginia the bulk of the investigation there is\nThat the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for how the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet\nOn whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn the record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs couldn't presented a lethal threat to anyone\nOn background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing\nA law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analyst at the ATF have raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated them it appeared\nFrom the photos that were made public that perhaps these devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks outside the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even as advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI facing anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nContain anthrax or any material like that\nBut that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's in all of these uh these bombs potential lumps\nSo law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here and PR is

are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America Democrat to North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political finds him and you can almost see other county line between the Democratic side draw one father Kelly live and you move into another job you're more rural county and all of a sudden this country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray gas percent said the area is about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrat\nAnd well he teaches party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state and turning blue\nWhere ... ... ... to ... or ... rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman diction seat says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party\nTo the Republican

twenty\nFive percent tariff slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price ... and we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of role in with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard\nTo nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point\nFor example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant but one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op\nHe says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real effects but we are in an election year so I figured there'd

prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to hold this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped into by us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of fighting from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to come into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and
