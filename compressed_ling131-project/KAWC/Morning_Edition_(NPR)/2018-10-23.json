but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nOh we're trying to deal with the problem a partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their badge\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen if it will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for me\nPrint court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and he'd earls who's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seats\nAre you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written\nThat we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally\nAnd I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made too much you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama knew\nWhen they go low we don't know [noise] they go low\nWe can what did you mean what I meant ... in that remark was that ah I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nHas you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise] well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I must say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who's very powerful when young people marched here\nI'm In Washington to ask for more I sing gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves\nAttorney general holder thanks so much and I think you [noise]\n\nAll right Steve the negative millions lottery is up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B ... set for tonight and yes it's a very exciting but your chances our chances of that one in three hundred million\nNow some people come up with plans to improve their odds in a big one is getting a bunch of coworkers together and forming an office pool what about that\nOne in three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million I'm that both astronomical so the odds are basically the same\nJason Kirkland is a lawyer who represents jackpot winters and he says if your\nOffice pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office pools\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's and the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been involved where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nOr you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're going and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to and I understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that the last thing you need are twenty people at twenty lawyers are going to court and fighting over this and tying the money up for years or or God Knows how much\nIf you do when and you need a lawyer he will probably take your call unless he's the one

asks census takers if they are us citizens\nAnd here's how long has been reporting on these lawsuits he joined us now from New York morning on the\nMorning to oil so why did the Supreme Court temporarily block a lower order for the commerce secretary to testify for these lawsuits well\nThis is a request from the Trump Administration which has been arguing that these lawsuits should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already release for these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question how much secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient\nThat there have been inconsistencies in a roast his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question and the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country and at this point the trouble ministry action could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block car secretary Wilbur Ross is deposition\nOregon even asked the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen industry out if that is the case\nWell what is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing over the citizenship question\nIt means that the windows really closing took like additional evidence to support their claims in this lawsuit\nAnd it's important remember the Supreme Court did allow last night and this order the plaintiffs attorneys to question the Justice Department official John Gore he's the acting head of the civil rights division that the administration says needs the citizenship question to better enforce the voting rights act\nAnd the Supreme Court is allowing additional document requests but again

in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electrical effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing it we've\nRaised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governor is always a matter of state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and he'd earls or who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seats\nAre you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench will look at the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as a as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what

forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think through votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to

been involved where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling

which has been arguing that these laws you should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already released for these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question how secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient that there have been inconsistencies in a row of his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country and at this point at the troubled ministry action could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block car secretary Wilbur Ross is deposition\nOregon even asked the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen in the trial if that is the case\nWell what is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing the citizenship question\nIt means that the windows really
