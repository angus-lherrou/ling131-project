ago this week uh epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small had among other impediments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and producer radio documentary called the love story among the people he met where'd your ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nIn Alaska emotional about this on on singing talents to push through to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to ... to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they were very very they were very tight group last solidarity\nVery determined women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it's a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of common for special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which has caught the night shift mothers of angels\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politician sympathetic ... people have such trying campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these\nGroup in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politician sympathetic ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very turned off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most of the\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children you can walk to can stand there is some children who ... woods and can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind that pays it you know at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over on the fed through achieve into that tell me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who were more physically disabled or actually cognitively less uh and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around it's an incredibly mixed saying\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins and a girl who was born with ... and her brother did not was not that good\nYeah it was you had this franchise it'll go minutes of it so that she was called a she really couldn't move very much so she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother he would turn off him who he was acting just thought you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know that kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they don't know why it affected one twin and another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or it's the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to

deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving them pep talks and should sort of saying you know you need to write to the magnates right to the health extreme tell him to give you a bus to tell your child to school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really want to deal with now\n[noise]

and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flying every which way and the Kavanaugh's confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups they can keep their donors secret\nThe thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ads\nThe centers Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota a little over four\nMillion dollars that's been spent running ads and injustice states\nThere's two million dollars more being spent in Maine home of

there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water and sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the air strikes and ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little a says here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa
