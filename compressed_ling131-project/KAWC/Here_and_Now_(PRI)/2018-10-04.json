be down in a very different different now I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in ... psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was reading about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involves the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the Australian army was so ill prepared that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes tend to sometimes veterinarians to serve a very important roles and feel hospitals on the front ... numbers of men [noise]\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to foreign medical responsibilities if you saw on credit for something that resonated with me and the place I was in at that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an\nArmy issued medical manual that often advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instruction for the soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about wounds that might be teeming with maggots just horrifying ensuring clumps they team they stirred like embers the lights as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seem they came out upon a cone grainy like wet meal [laughter] just\nDisgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressing and amputations which\nHe had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her so\nOriginally I had an imagined driving the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that measures would arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical staff and there'd be a nurse would\nProvide a background role that much like ... I found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with Lucia who again has arrived at this place she doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons and amputate this what this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this soldier Lou should ask smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home if he called his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of who she is and the Washington Post writes she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie\nAdaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic way I think that I'm very drawn to visual images of the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nYou know right there just a snapshot of\nWho she is and the Washington Post right she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her heart and the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic early because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as meeting a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic way I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I had all grown up imagining in the trenches and the muddy field so ... of Belgium this is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military army but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\nLoses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumble into this classic Russian classic advance in a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of war what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their mind as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was the psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shocked\nAnd yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen if there's some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about\nThe high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf or the scan it into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's what we see Lucia is our doctor mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret benign issuing a human being who suffering\nIs this something that you said you relate to a lot to lose this do does this something that a transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and then when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into wards and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated\nAnd that many doctors go through and then when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into words and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them and their family and those people who care for them\nAnd that increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that looks just go through\nA we just want to touch on the Seventy absurdist notion there was\nThe daughter an old professor in Vienna who steals and alleged murder made from a medium because he wants to actually to see what it is enter a young scientist female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helped with that there is a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hand\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with this caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies it's replaced by another soldier with the same name it does it have serenity to war\n\n[noise] if you want to move to Japan you'll need to know a few things to fit in Japanese people are more\nModest and reserved in public they don't usually talk loudly and touring the state the popular British TV shows might give you the

B. or he joins us now account hijacked and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures so the\nProjection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective\nA spending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order on\nLives of the ... model of where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that it's going to increase its minimum paid Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season the market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers\nAnd reported that the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents and that's a big jump from an average of eleven and Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on\nGifts could other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the terrorists are especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level ... eleven what's going on\nHere right so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on and investors mind but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market but if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates in other things also start to take off even more ... of WB or thank you so much like to be with you\nWell as the earlier vice president

long\nTaiwan's international support began waning after it lost its seat to mainland China and the United nations in Nineteen Seventy one by the Nineteen nineties about thirty countries still chose Taiwan over Beijing\nBut China has been ... away at those allies to date only sixteen countries and the Vatican still recognized Taiwan the biggest bloc of support is in Central America and the

ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment\nWill Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that at big you know Ninety seconds and uh back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hoped that are in the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSuddenly like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm soldier that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food\nOr you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called a liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had no inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a\nA feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that I was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life\nAlthough in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was silent saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a nondisclosure I'm not stupid um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas with very happy\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was silent saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas with very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cullen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false I was fine when saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and\nI just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell my side of the stories that people would understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nUm I think we're about to find out on what is the December twelve he was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what you know there's but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean it met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know um but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figured nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now I Do I have to they're awesome [laughter] but what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel on I was used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not\nYou say your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people in a high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today how would you describe it today\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] from around the ... he asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nDo not following politics closely\nThings yet but

many of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have\nHave like some songs inspired by Brazilian some but there's some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the genre overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bands I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meets poolside\nOh I like that that's great we have poolside on the show actually they're great um yeah let's listen to the next one you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys are this is called sport [noise]\n\nTell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely without going on but I see in a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people are saying it's a commentary on male hyper masculinity\nUm when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy on track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep as they would give me a way to fire up before bed\nAnd this song ... has the same effect on me every time I hear it\nAnd obviously funny what'd you say it's like a good listen to do you like to listen to it\nThe song is an unbelievably find listening yet I mean like ... or after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time as the song moves on to become the belief singers fashion Murphy becomes more and more ...\nUm until the end is basically just a blob puddle\nWill people maybe people can
