version these sharks and jets napping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing noticed them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story in the masterpiece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer Isaac\nOlivia fabulous well we'll

little\n\n\n\n... you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you know the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story week which was on the same program\nAnd to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nAnd it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of them than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought\nSomething's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as the west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nBy and you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that that's right that was the impression\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything

spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because it was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both\nMentioned in relation to Goldberg variation that Arlene crochet had panned it and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you and Robin affects

[noise]\nWonderful to ... I think we're it simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a foreign and his dream girl who comes and visit\nHim and with those

under routine and nobody cares still and cares is you know you and a few people that us and question\nObviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stop delaying get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested\nA upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le defended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see\nThem well I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain to the full house where the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is the tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nIt's a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a fall there\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYeah it's well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOf the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nOr there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who I'm with an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or place in a blind trust\nHis business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously then raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge administration that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they\nYou personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nArizona was in college will be hosting a CPR proceed certification class with instructor Joanna

[noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in Lucerne county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep code and Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering or what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate\nSays something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a ... who out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what\nAbout religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not\nMajority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does\nHe's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical\nThey're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing and that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict or um the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I read the county coroner\nThis is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict or the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I'd read of the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really a sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nThere's only going up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you'll Republican Party doesn't seem to care ... ... what about\nThese voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able\nTo do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over ... and everything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "17"}
