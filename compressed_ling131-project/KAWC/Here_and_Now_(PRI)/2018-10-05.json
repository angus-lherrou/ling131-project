Bergen plays the older but still fast talking broadcast journalist who returns alongside the original cast NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it ...\nHey so Murphy Brown was always about mining politics for entertainment back in the day I'd had fans from both sides of the aisle Senator Orrin hatch Republican of Utah even sending the head shot hoping to make a guest appearances do you think you could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort now\nIn one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah ah for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she couldn't open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how ...\nTo the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack a that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no been when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be top journalist\nSo of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown\nAnd because he's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state or to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that or let's let's let's say\nAnd I also feel you've had previous secretarial which theory absolutely for four years that with the secretary [noise] I like the secretary of a very large are going to [noise] and you have the skills computer male female [noise] I I Do have some experience with [noise]\nAlways makes you wonder if you know running again I Can't tell [laughter] no I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails\nEditor right um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was a she is also appeared in a an episode of a Madam Secretary of you know that trauma um alongside Colin Powell and I'm I'm a and and uh other political so\nI'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and\nPushing back against the monitor shape with a GOP so it it is not a bipartisan that the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life\nMeets fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quilt criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nYeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets in them responding to him I think\nWe have [noise]\nYou know [noise]\n\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a deliberate of various effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found\nSome of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish to show 'em ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweeted them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um\nSome of the humor to be a kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like to kind of wish the show ... these people making a kind of was the show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it and sort of treated them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but\nUm what's really happening is that there are so many people that have been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night uh comedians that we have Steven ... Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh for NOAA that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think is left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times well what about\nThe idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled or revivals you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver\nAnd all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slap living near the show a over it so\nI'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way they get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but\nThe show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so I you know I don't think a lot of younger people we've we're familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it um it's still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nTo NPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing vet Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct\nMost have changed significantly since back then but it in to the ... from the there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep school the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just said as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra let's God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes shake that forget\nWas a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy and their weight\nStill a ways to go to many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra let's God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recall hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety to Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh when\nCentered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\n\nOn my ... sat next time on Latino USA conversation with Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor about writing to books are getting all challenges are not to be just putting out when\nThey become part of what we hang with us then next time on the usa\n[noise]\n\nYou can hear Latino USA this evening at seven here on K.

that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Jeremy well let's start with a number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as\nYou mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg serve\nSeven percent in September of the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor of Bloomberg News he joins us now how Mike Hi Germany well let's start with the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well rate as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work due to the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather\nUm and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely yeah and ah you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten or ... the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict out of my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is over the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet\nUm but it's it by all accounts a very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice skiing but again not so strong that it makes you worry about and overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike ... of Bloomberg News thank you factor\nIn Tempe is touting knows new jobs numbers on Twitter and that's John economy also came out the his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most hotly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first [noise]\nIt's supposed to be a Democrat\n\nNews and we're already up to a two and two course to the two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg new thank you ...\nPresident Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and the strong economy also came up at his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his weight into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIt was supposed to be a Democrat thing\nI\nDon't think very surprised [laughter]\nThat that surprises at the Republican Jim how you doing wins he's facing the Democrat Dan ... both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn for this week's district profile cats and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and Catherine Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester ... which are sort of the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team with almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well so let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat than the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned the Democrats and industries that he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplish incredibly great thing and that's exactly what Congress did I\nI'm not taking over so that means I opened up in the leader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the case for Democrats as a moderate just starting to do so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWell none of the Republican Jim had adorned in his reason add he talked about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington ... government are so rather than a Trump pulling\nFor Congress to help and rip out the regulation Obamacare and both of us are grown so Catherine\nWe hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and it's playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager and lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Feehan\nSeen remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning um and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and ... is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Finn he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats or I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really did stuff for Minnesota Senator Al Franken\nFor in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior be that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the of the accusations we've\nBeen hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics would the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm\nStill sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure

[noise] there\nAre some I Would say a handful of how\nOn one hand the amount of the lesson that were in support of Kavanaugh one\nPerson actually described himself as an independent I talked to him in

you\nWell as we continue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day look into our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen\nAnd joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon hosting senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHi how're you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick uh ... sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada lets us into one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nColumn senators buying less because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada no\nYou're right now actually goes away from ... Americans but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about your than what the hell are focused\nPromise and voted for repeal deciding to stir how how\nBig of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making a McClintock mark here you know this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more\nHeller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nSaid no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver\nTelling me what you going to be dealing with\nDean Heller and getting things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans part is the capital\nDelivered to the actual name ... is our ...\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking of that ad are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he's sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\n[noise] yeah that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called the peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seemed to change his vote and um they Adelson in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "05"}
