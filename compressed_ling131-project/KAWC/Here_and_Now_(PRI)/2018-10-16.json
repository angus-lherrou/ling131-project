the past six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden stories which continues the work of murder journalists and last week five members of the European Parliament calls to the European Commission to back an investigation into college his murder citing revelations from the forbidden stories work including\nThat the Maltese government sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter a European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes\nLauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories low rent a you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina ... was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were facts of the world cup for forty five reporters for the past six months we were able to reveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the motives\nI learned and we were riveting some consenting Fox about some potential links between the economy minister and some of the people who have been a route to because they were triggering to vote there were new to really pushing the button pushing the button\nYeah they were using the cell phone that was connected to the bone under the calls for ... like I did sell the day or she is shifting kill at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so during the investigation with the work of the collaborative\nTeam we were able to meet some people who told us that the ups in the economy minister with\nThose two suspects before the murder and to the work of the ... project was not only a ball to identify you might be the key those but it's up to complete the stories of ...\nTo ... to a very critical work because her stories was bolt sensitive issues like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to complete the will definitely the name of it\nWhat was the bolt sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to conflict will definitely the name of that political to death in the project\nSo again you had a Maltese government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nWell I'm investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and um I used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to stop for begins to reason this up and\nActually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of our K dot in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in pirates\nAnd they into the ... and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to the two minutes after the terrorist escaped the building\nAnd I ... into the newsroom and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this really truly changed my life because\nThis was happening and parrots these was not happening on a conflict zone was touching Iraq was in the middle of pirates was in my personal environment\nHe was a bold clicks I knew and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed for ... they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder to report to to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling there he usually when a journalist gets killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murder or you can kill the messenger but you will kill\nThe message that story at look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter Don Boggs was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nA new organization sprung up what's called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work\nBut there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work\nWe also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper a was attacked in so many killed threats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you do you just there I mean it didn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing a lot of threats not totally in South America and not only in Mexico in Europe too in a an old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's the globe of an collaborative response collaboration\nAll continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the ... we see that there was a group of children is ready to complete the investigation and to expose the crimes then that will probably think tried for the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the reason that project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send the pool full signal to the enemies of the price you kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are here to make sure people to get access to the very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support\nThere a lot of children is to have been killed a lot of many for beaten stories behind with that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it's it's not just to a number we're talking about ... important stories important information that some people wanted to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I ... I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a an investigative journalist with locked up in either by John as there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization\nI think it's a ... a B R AJ eyes they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on and he said collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters\nThat brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post democracy Jody I'm us and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what this terribly use he was ... he was working on we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that so that so\nI Hope we get more information to build the disappearance of a of this um ... I Hope that we'd be able to get some information Saudi Arabia is very difficult country to rock and\nSo he was a kind of voice very rare very unique\nSo we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to to work to get those went to look at what kind of ... he was publishing those pastures\nAnd when I saw I'm Wondering he said when you came upon your colleagues largely cartoon is a satirical cartoonist from Charlie Hebdo who's been murdered or were dying you said that you you think you could not get those images out of your head\nKidnapped at the same time during a deadly attack on a minute the base of handicap stopped and NPR News\nA Cuban dissident report it to have been on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment for sixty two days is that to be free the Associated Press deciding acumen dissident group and reporting\nThat local authorities released on my ... my ... the U.S publicly called for his release earlier this month and also launched a campaign of the United nations today for Cuba to release political prisoners\nAnd respond to have on accuses the Trump Administration of promoting supremacy and racist agenda\nWith no authority to demand human rights reforms strong earnings for major U.S companies are factoring in today's surge on Wall street the Dow is that four hundred and fifty seven points this is NPR\nSupport for NPR comes from NPR stations other contributors include Subaru featuring the own new three row ascent with feeding for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs love it's what makes us Subaru a Subaru learn more at ... dot com\nYou weren't tuned to NPR is here in now on eighty eight point nine of them came a WC and K WC dot org it's eleven those six\nABC's health and wellness department will be hosting a domestic violence and breast cancer awareness walk tomorrow at ten am at the three the building breeze way on the human camp is if you like more information feel free to contact those nine to wait three or four seven six nine zero\nFrom Andy On WB you are I'm Out in young I'm Jeremy Hobson it's here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh Saudi Arabia he's been meeting today with king Solomon and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAnd they'd growing concerns about Saturday involvement in the death of journalists and us resident Jamal cut showed gee there are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that ... died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nFor the latest what's bringing ... MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co host of ... in rural highly Jeremy and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we know it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king ... the father of Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a rogue group of people maybe having a ... ah and then that's what the Saudis are floating a big issue here is that uh the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing\nThe threat of sanction and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and when\nYou said the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that Mike Pompeo the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out like Mike Pompeo is there or if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explaining to the Saudis that this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered a that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses\nThe president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something\nSo that the next step can take place what has all this done to the U.S relationship\nSome may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia and with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nDoing I think is bigger than we realize oftentimes impact we're having on young people is more significant deeper than we can conceive\nI'm Ari Shapiro around table or they'll GB CQ candidate plus the secretary of state visit to Saudi Arabia this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n\nWe will bring you all things considered this afternoon from three to six here a listener supported gay WC eighty eight point nine up in\nHuman county library is hosting small business where Trump's presented by Andrews ... this week there'll be featuring build your own product or service it will be this Friday afternoon for three to five at the ...\nPresented by Andrew Solomon this week there'll be featuring build your own product or service it will be this Friday afternoon from three to five at the humane library twenty nine fifty one cell twenty first Dr you can find for details that you my library dot org\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade\nA tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I are wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone or said that I was throwing shade on the new\nOr the new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest crowd in history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture\nOf the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean I kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes\nDo you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary that is a very rarely is there\nA negative feedback in and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they ended up commenting back to the sea and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know is that Russian botched but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in science around feed just and saying what they want to say\nOr in this book I you've got to\nReally interested in science around feed just and saying what they want to say\nOr in this book I you've got a often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post this one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf ... and ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tell me in cheek hawk poke I guess what's\nThe one that you're most proud of that you're like I Can't believe I thought of that [noise]\nAh the the [laughter] I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\n... you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people at his inauguration and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history\nFox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty tends to union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong noon and ... and calling and little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\n[laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing um\nYou know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and I thought now that the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and he just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nWas uh doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe un ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear the by somebody else before you post among the surround\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUm because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\n... do you

grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected caffeine is director of the little ed school how to fill it first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement well\nYou said that are part of this was based on a you know research is looking at an attempt to isolate the minority students and we tend to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat others in their classrooms and for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this school handbook which says\nIn the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this school handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that\nThere is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and then as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many\nColleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers are white and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects a minority students negatively isn't home all the place where it's it's much uh you know that much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had a junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial or gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmates\nIn a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen twenty\nAnd that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now you've dropped the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what it what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the components of students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh\nWhere you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by then you know um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educated who said there are times to group kids of color together you have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards photographer Tom telling me the judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I Choose what made the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I don't have to think about why I just about how I view my average\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can will also have last year's\nWinters up because those were hilarious but this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he's sitting job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer marry him a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIs allowed and it's definitely one of my favorites I think it's very simple who just to see the animal and the ...
