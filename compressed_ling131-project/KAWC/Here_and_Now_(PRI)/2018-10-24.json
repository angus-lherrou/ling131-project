least five years and petition estate bored doing back there right but in Nevada sex voters will decide whether to amend their state constitution\nHe's five years and petition the state board to win back their rights\nBut on November sex voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to vote to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted of murder or a sex crime here now to Chris Stanley took a closer look\n[noise] it's opening day after living harvest a thrift shop and south Tallahassee the stores managed in staffed by former felons making the transition back into society [noise]\nDale why does the nonprofit found [noise] he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for felony DUI and it was released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turn their lives around but finding housing unemployment\nI'm a big big person about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a form of selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returned home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community could happen in most I was able to vote\nTwenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott has approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past the conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Cain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nA set of the car [laughter] how do they even go in and be able to feel deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him or herself or feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we still live amongst other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system uh have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff Walton McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know the sexual batters who uh\nAgrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nRelates to other things like ah you know the sexual batters who uh those keeping them away from kids and wait for schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those appropriate steps to take\nBut just the fundamental right to vote there's no proof that are taking their right to vote away deters them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then there are more out in my opinion to give up and turned to a lot of crime because there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so we went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted an office to relax certain things but I never got involved because I said what I can make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen why ...\n... recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like a book of this part of a bucket list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do uh I just me but I like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold that would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state and a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here and now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term and but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland\nNice even person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time there are times are up\nIt's already a new governor is an office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that\nThere is also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Barack Obama saying Scott I sympathize with you here of course I wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky Clinton's 'em all part of\nWanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Fred Lewis picky acquaintances I'm all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for the decisions and so forth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policy\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron Santo spokesperson warned and he's a Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups and to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWhy did they did that you know I Do not so great to be hiding in your chair and joined us this week for a way with words\n[noise]\n\nAway with words airs this evening from seven to eight here on K WC\nEighty eight point nine of them here and now continues in a moment Kay\nTill you see is supported by the human county chamber of commerce connecting local businesses with a network of business and organization leaders through monthly chamber breakfast and mixers an interactive website chamber publications and more learn about the opportunities and benefits of chamber membership at human chamber dot\nOrg\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star as of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite run to sentence as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida's history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need\nA con sorts of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs and others on behalf\nOf its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now I'm a Republican or refuse to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that's right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's on his\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMissile defenses described a community is one where people are sheltering themselves in homes and avoiding the streets and he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if you ... do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created ...\nFifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted are restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law this uh you know ... this is Trump be in politics it is not based in\nReality I Wanna see that President Trump you know in your date with Ron descent as you said he was just too much for the president you may no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with ads of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nIn terms pulling them but they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nAh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIs completely inappropriate behavior and Mr disasters\nHe is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nAh racists Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and a kind of a community\nWhere my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nJust answered said if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ... list of money on many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately from its dissenters this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nI say for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle that disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars\nI'm going to take that money and I'm a put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure\nHelp on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day\nOn the phone talk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent advantage is now petitioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent the toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nOpponent can say anything he wants to end an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah\nOn a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida\n... thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care part of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Gillum his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both saw it with a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum his brother now the textbook Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton

some exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot that on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane hits and what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he had the Democrats and\nI'm a Republican I'm going to be voting\nYou and you're going to be\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami they're really Patel let Jake Bernstein an Alexander ... healthcare President Trump can the sitting governor the Republican Rick Scott I'm the longtime Senator Bill Nelson is a lot going on so that can be in our Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and make Anthony an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL Iran in Miami Jaime gay Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you and your status I'm Glad [laughter] and when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin thanks for having me on well we want to start\nCloser to you and your state and weather here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin thanks for having me on well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it after this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told him about the health in ticket or that the developer had for them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIt it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissenters in some polling right\nYeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the disadvantages camp is going to try to use this to point to uh\nDishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the President's Day people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here\nAnd we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWhile I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there's a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being the fantasy was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for Kennedy\nWell Enrique until they don't let me bring you in here because of president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this as he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way you know through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to be like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how that resonating where you are in Miami\nHe's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the cabin and saying they're all for open\nYou are in Miami thank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the cabin and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nThey put the the the issue of immigration front and center which you'll really wants to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention this government has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to the midterm election\nUh we'll see that on a ... depending on the journal both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell and not to be clear this is a cabinet are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happened quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last care of and that may got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nAnd you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Rob and you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the security Maria\nOver the Puerto Ricans have seems a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent turnouts in order for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd here senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for so after telling a lie because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's at the edge here and I especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the ... year yeah I I mean", "show_name":
