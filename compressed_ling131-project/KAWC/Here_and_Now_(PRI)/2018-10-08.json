conflict in Yemen is taking a terrible toll on civilians who are caught in crossfire a civil war started there in twenty fourteen today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides\nOf the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as to these who'd these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's\nHumanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people eight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it same mind made a trauma that is\nAnd see all the international Rescue Committee David Miliband region in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people eight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day\nIt's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it same man made a trauma that is the results of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I mean neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about yeah\nI mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the heart of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by a who's the to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control of the capital Sana'a on of Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition of shifted the front lines Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through\nOn what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between who sees and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who these are the right\nThen the other side from the Saudis the Nikkei\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle\nBut in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south I'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death\nBut at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of al Qaida and ISIS\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down I'm going to say what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people are on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses are not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid\nAs a country which can't sustain itself or the moment it's being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the sides are waging it was in fact being exploited\nBy extremists and I think that the onus on the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S in the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian on the political emergency is a cease fire\nWent into whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nIt's being ravaged by war that\nIs not to the benefit of any of the signs are waging it but in fact being exploited\nBy extremists and I think that the onus on the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S on the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nHold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U.S and the others want what their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back who the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed a on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S experts say make them pay us in the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties obviously sticks\nIn the ... because I met a Yemen these who ... told me about missiles had landed on hospital next to a health gets on to that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in ... the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians slightly I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not wanting to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI I'm not causing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the base of the most basic norms of international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un inquiries\nHave produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis but now I came away saying that the world and it's a wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there wasn't a whole night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the pen needs to be picked up because there is no sort of current debate to replace the failed un ... resolution twenty Fifteen with some you know there's actually a roof map to peace rather than the cop lunch for\nIf we take the issue of um a refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington\nUm you have said that regarding help from the western world they moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work\nJust for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of uh\nThey ... moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year how does that affect your work\nWe'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh\nHistorically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture or from children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the the U. S. actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translates into things\nThat are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life to work out that the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of that support for the bad not being allowed in\nMichael's expected to make landfall by mid week in Florida's panhandle or big band you're listening to hear now [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSecretary John Kerry has a new book that had lines of the time to get out and vote nobody has a right to sit there and say well I don't have a stake in the snow we all have a stake in our democracy doesn't work life so\nThe only way to make it work just to put people in office I Want to move the country in the right to Speaker John Boehner every day is extra\n... living on her and then the our eyes\nWe hope you'll join us for a living on earth this evening from seven to eight here on KBA WC eighty eight point nine FM and K.

a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some

began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nYou know at nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not

nights herself spoke about quite severe\nUm physical violence or\nAt the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally being\nUm victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back one\nOf the of some of those five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there will be some people who remember mostly don't a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal\nWithout ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms um\nBut but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially and so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why the feminist movement has grown is because of\nA dissatisfaction with\nWith a huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do because these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways\nFalling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage and eat and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of\nWhat I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how was the Japanese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies\nUm so the the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\n\nStay with us we're more here and now beginning in just a minute on gay WC eighty eight point nine FM indicate WC dot org it's eleven thirty nine\nTime you knew from the human

eight hundred nine four seven auto\nDoes is hearing now author Sara Sara's on tackled some pretty tough subjects in her young adult fiction her debut novel centered on two girls who love for each other or put them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah fairs on as a child of parents who came to the U.S from Iran I asked her what she and that student ... have in common\nWe went to similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly white an affluent um private school if you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller\nAnd so it should um give it up we both love comic books and we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here so you\nPlace to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues and right right and he said we don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photoshopped image of him to look like a\nTerrorists holding an AK forty seven was in the ... right right yeah so shocked on yeah and I had sent it anonymously to the student body to the school trying to figure out who had sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm going to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an ally it's sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be\nUm the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where\nWhen nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared I didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all the rage like hate crime on the radio and so on\nFor international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well we asked what's the difference between polite and impolite where he said I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of\nA little barbed or and made to sort of others someone\nWho had a speech on in the book realized that understand I think\nHe's he's had to deal with sort of ... and for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part it's pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people in his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know up or yeah how would school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to\nTo have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean wouldn't have what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia I'd like the character to just have an adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do kind of just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady that was your first and you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and that says you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address the thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes but for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with\nThe character doesn't weigh like he he does your person you don't want to be the ... yeah\nWell no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and that says you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address the thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\nWhat do you what does the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is the main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah fires on the book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to here and now dot org\n[noise]\nToday the
