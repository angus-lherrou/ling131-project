U. and read and I know you and your colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story Michael made land for for more than two weeks ago\nBut so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people and sheltered at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than that you know thousand or so people\nWas among the with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn had her spoke with tons of Denise Graham she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo you multiply her sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about it I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see mode rental assistance and his waiting on a check\n'em but but then what I mean where is she supposed she can find housing but where she's supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers that you can you just say these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting vouchers\nAnd they do the you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here we come we're putting the trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course the local governments are are still putting themselves back together\nAnd so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this as low risk by there all the shelter is of course yeah well\nWell uh and by the way we see female people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter and a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we don't charge you name it was just like all the windows busted out back\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have I Am her house was destroyed a brother in law is houses destroyed ...

um\nBut they think there are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently accurate and that's really why we were so very concern is that we have an open

across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say that ...\nThis is the politics of the seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by

these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain and the ... when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burned and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time became taller and taller and you can actually see the different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplits climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pirates that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's a definitely a very respectful

living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand a de\nThese mouths and we're right on top now these now have weathered uh women a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mound and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are ready on top of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be

everything and redo everything is very much better than what is the worst problem when you say clean is it because all the water came up in here ...\n... planes there's gotta be fresh was really I mean just a lot of work\nThat work includes moving heavy industrial palate and constantly spraying the mud and then for this processing plant opens out onto the day we can see buckle broken dogs and idle or Easter both hurricane Michael landed a punch here\nBut this was an industry already on its knees there's the fears water wars freshwater from the Appalachian coal river\nFlows from Georgia to Florida and the Supreme Court recently agreed with Florida that Georgia takes too much leading less of the fresh water to lower the salt level in the bay and keep that day that salt loving creatures that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate change which brings severe drought\nThey were once hundreds of boats pulling in thousands of pounds of oysters outside this processing plant and because of the salt balance they were considered the best tasting in the world according to New York times\nNow there are hardly any native Cloisters and Tommy son TJ has turned to aquaculture growing baby boisterous or stat without shelves\nBut the wars were also leading the fight to seize oyster shells with baby oysters and place them out of the bay to try to bring the native oyster reefs back and now Michael\nOutside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holds his stomach doesn't feel so\nOutside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holds his stomach he doesn't feel

one thing but it's like a body blow on top of the punches you've already been getting because of the changing river and we've gone through all the problems that were the water that isn't coming down from Georgia and it being battled over\nLegal risk for much of what we had what we have here it is big industry and go ...\nNot really taking care of us down there and you know kind of like I got a

the state is grappling with toxic algae it was just inundated by hurricane Michael and we've been looking at the Appalachian coal river which begins upstream in Georgia as the Chattahoochee\nThat everyone can agree on but Florida and Georgia have been locked in a wider war over\nGeorgia's use of the ... river water\nIn June the Supreme Court agreed with Florida that the state does suffer ecological an economic harm from Georgia's overuse of the law a special judges still sorting all out which will take time why does this matter well we've talked about how the local police or industry has been devastated because of the lack of fresh water\nThat balances the cell the waters of the day and the Gulf beyond\nThis week we met up in Appalachia ... with river keeper Georgia acrimony from the nonprofit river keeper alliance generators humming hurricane debris piled high [noise]\nLockdown waters tasty never probably more appropriately named water street [noise] you know you were telling

economic cost of replacing all this equipment and [noise] um insurance rhythm and Raul and everything that they will have to go through to get the three played so that they can be doing what

[noise] now\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the grass it's over there\nJust got really healthy marsh is throughout the apple at Kobe that one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida or Easter population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters and indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population that scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fish that healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this\nChallenge with the oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with their other parts of your system\nNear the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with\nThis river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designation for you but you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it and they include\nScientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to deliver keepers office a boat you had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and Rene lab her\nColleague Dr ... brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all his nutrient is not coming down into the salad needed water and coming down anymore so that's a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish gross\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYeah when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happened the problem with salt will truth that encourages these marine credits at such an oyster drills and ground called\nAbout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nSit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and stick its ... and basically consume the always to from within and it's not a whole lot the ...\nScrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and stick its ... basically consume the always the from within and it's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather efficacy\nI'll check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nLet's start with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and ... all the oysters is the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the shows in a couple of years later and there was no bridge stock left there\nTo re populated I think about the function set oyster surfaces beyond\nThe economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race are she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that Paul ... is that voice ... shall what they larval oysters settled on but\nDistributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that has been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nFair particular types of research that could be done that could relatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the\nFisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full\nDr ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about these selling nation plant\nI think there are more problems\nAnd the ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but the all the time and come back\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but they are also other factors in play you know the
