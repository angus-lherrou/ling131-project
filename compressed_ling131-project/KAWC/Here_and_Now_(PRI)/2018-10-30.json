G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty cut [laughter] anyway yeah like the wind is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I liked the idea\nOf having protections for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminal\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out for the first it's my turn an outrage monitored and they get out it's my on your program and I get a shot for our it's like OK here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nWorst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stays in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those and\nIt would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing the crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you are\nSo getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment\nFor them is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or what are people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even Mike DeWine would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there is a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIt is a big deal it's always a big deal but Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting majors we don't know exactly how they're going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nA show Ingles who covers politics at Ohio

discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us out of Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know the shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nAre saying that the plane was essentially Going Radical you doing things that we don't usually experience during Floyd my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft with going\nYou could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah uh and and in that\nThe crush of the coast rather uh Brazil or back in two thousand nine Air France flight more for seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes\nOr which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that health related flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and

S.\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now as Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which are reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where in their reside\nSo how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question though um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act the Eighteen sixties six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight by the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo that's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who's an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb\nBut as we've heard from those from the amendment and from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb\nWhen there are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nGet the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week and his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nIs changing his scheduled to be in Pittsburgh today but not everyone wants them there I'm Ari Shapiro reaction to the president's trip this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nWe hope you can join us for all things considered this afternoon from three to six Iran K.

hundred nine four seven auto\nThis year and now we had the rare opportunity last week to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember a short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and said the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian world rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a\nStructure of economy for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether you were in areas where we're sort of been prices means something or whether you're on the west coast\nOr the issue of high tech stock prices are a little one everyone talks about so one thing about this country it's very diverse out of the ... wherever you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell on the lookout into the future or we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity why oh well basically because fear\nYou know what to do with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nUm uh just inclination to take risks and the book insulin I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say that the issue the aging of the population of its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant measures\nThat the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nEntitlements which are mandated by law a gradually and inexorably driving our gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that\n[laughter] first of all do I think it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it it could cause the debt overall the total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation is a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that the below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low as ... unemployment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo it is does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two conditions as as a choir and for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic assets like a secure dies two mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages are financed and when they are financed by leverage that that\nHow those mortgages financed and when the finance or by liberal reached that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell either one of the general uh now that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep breaks down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower productivity but it's the issue or when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage rates are going to rise of necessity and it's the wage rate rises which\nAffect the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem lies and it hasn't really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nOr creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nCagey WCW must send them to you my art center sponsor the film series Thursday at the theater than the

Ninety seven Jerry Rabinowitz sixty six Cecil Rosenthal was fifty nine years old David Rosenthal fifty for Bernie Simon was eighty four Sylvan Simon was eighty six Daniel Stein aged Seventy one Melvin wax\nEighty eight and Irving Younger was sixty nine they all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show a show we wish we had to help us through a week like this\nFor British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us from ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell they\nBritish thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell that this is a really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community that diverse the diversity in the community of squirrel hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um the bakeries that delicatessens\nAnd he often commented that you could hear yet ... Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as he walked down the street of that community\nYou actually learn cheaper to me he did yes well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\nI'm\nThere to Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhoods the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think what's reflected to him it through the ... community\nAnd probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nThat word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nFascination me [noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it\n\nMeans\nSomebody getting killed in a sort of surprised way\nWhat happened you know being killed that other man\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about it a lot of people are\nScared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day when if you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company later lady overland goes on to change the subject to up to that but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nA she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] well I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim now where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that\nHis mother always told him in times of crisis\nSense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes [noise] as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence lets us and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nI clean for your protection\nAnd support\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nA very young child can take\nWith out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for Ed Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good nest attractive [laughter] I think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the help or it helps to see the good that is still around us\nFor glad you said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean the fly simply hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would\nHe would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reaction to the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor in the greater sense of the world that everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
