independence and there are those\nDo not um how how divided in Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the year since we had him really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed it divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now\nThey believe the wrong thing this increased it is the

warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various food and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved the frying at home\n[noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spend a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started to fire but you want to hear my first step yeah I use a walk\nA walk the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil notes flattering it's got the high sides you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nAdd about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Critz go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there\nI can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I'm always a genotype it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some butter led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch alright because but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that is sick flavor but it also does tend to her eyes the chicken\nI take it out and then I stopped it well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you'd see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up\nAnd here's another track okay because if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the press pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not an over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of honey here and some limits so I Do so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFried show ya I'd like to write the hunting isn't the hunting out this sweet flavor that's there but it's settle down a kind of pulled it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of her oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown\nBut the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will\nAgain you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw is ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy and is\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I'd simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\nTerm\nAnd the next living on earth analysts and isn't just from one generation to then I remember

million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year\nDo you have any idea why\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for\nCrisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seen a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them and it's\nA symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off there are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car\nStep for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them and it's a symptom\nOf the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who come in late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive by is to go to address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house has like a lotta times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west I'm seeing reports out of Idaho the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different\nBut I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families\nIt's like we're not keeping up with the need so we're going to help her unit\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported ... it's\nSome set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them

going to the government to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help the\nBig picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day in your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with through class work\n[noise] it's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nAnd their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nJoined us this week for a way with words\nHang

Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis this year and now to people in eastern Russia I told the Washington Post on friday that they recognize one of the men suspected of poisoning former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter earlier this year in England they say he is a decorated military officer\nAnd if that's true it would back up the British government's claim that the two men behind the attack are Russian military intelligence officers Russia says they're just civilians\nThe British investigation that identified the men relied on footage from closed circuit TV and help cracked the case Scotland Yard used a group of detectives detective known it's super recognize or people with an uncanny ability to remember face and that got us wondering how does that work\nJosh Davis studies super recognizing the psychology department at the University of Greenwich Hi Josh\nAnd Kenny long who used to be a detective in the new Scotland yard super recognize her unit Kenny welcome to you oh you and you are a super recognize or is that right oh suddenly am yes how in the world does that work\nI haven't got a clue on ... lucky and see if I if I say once I Will remember that face again\nReally so if you saw me on the street for instance in Nineteen eighty six when I was five years old and then we met again today would would you recognize me\nI'd be caught comes and it was on call of tests are different will may test with Josh and uh yeah ... ... do them\nWhen did you realize you add that skill\nI didn't ... I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well often find people from closed circuit television and I didn't have a clue ... until that point\nReally so and and and how does it work for you if you see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIt leaves you'd be amazed actually out in front of people from the back of the head from above who's with the soda\nIs a very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I look a vise I'll get nothing if ... if someone is going to be in a row style and you also have on well it's a rock star gone on stage that's exciting for them put me in a room full of people and pitches\nLast amazing smell you like that I Love it and those who prepping all just a\nIt's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would woken tools you they might smile she think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you will in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you recognize that the vice\nHuh do you have to commit that face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face Siamese songs I recognize them years later and\nYou didn't know this until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a\nKid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us ties to be correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do this I thought it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second found out what a super recognized off doing the test\nTo commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face Siamese songs I recognize ...\nAnd you didn't know this until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got the strange talent\nNot us ties to be correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do this all thought it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second found out what a super recognized off doing the test we have ... that's ...\nHuh you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning I insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSide firstly I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or if not with often taught people from the footage\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to all kinds of cash and Web I Would take time for the first each until we moved to ... ... scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we got some memory than if we see that person to get enough of it if it was stopped building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras\nCapturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you is the detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely putting his estimate about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that sleep recognize you and I wish I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always looking for the suspect sometimes that's been the victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help self ... people well what kind of cases did you crack\nA really good one was there was a mouse who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... just a suspect I've never met them before about seen a picture of them full solve going around in the police ... he's giving me folks details destroy swab we lost at the same\nAnd they've been stopped several times other police officers who had recognized him the ... most wanted but luckily struggle I mean cops and when we took him back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get cool off didn't we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate it it's a very unique skill\nWow Josh David let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think this you sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability say\nWe found some very small difference is in the way the brain function and I think that's the sort of direction the ... the research may be going in future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nThink is a different function is is quite an interesting question that because people have done research on a world champion super memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this and when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they were\nAnd see in the way the brain function and I think that sort of direction that the research may be going in future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think is a different function as it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seems to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing soda streams and numbers and words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact was the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities needing to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of\nStrange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces as well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beat computers\nI think in the future will what the situation's gotten so bad it's the best

D. Anderson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHas a maintenance I was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those teeth out to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those details are really held in check to ensure\nThat those folks do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolved including patients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we\nChemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer absolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolved including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Andy Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nUh the NBA Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer affect\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again congratulations thank you so much\nWell now to Spain and the city of punted ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than hiking horns that's because much of the city is now car free parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine\nFreelance journalist Stephen virgin wrote about this he joins us on Skype from Barcelona welcome high and did they ban cars entirely and punted ada well\nThey they ban them from the initially some of the story of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extended that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the the Eighteen Nineteen century part of the city so the city centers calm free and then it's it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it was you know very well let's say you know like most of these things that was a little resistance ah people you know associate having caused with a personal Liberty City um but I spoke to local people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone\nTo a slightly bigger a area which is sort of the the Eighteenth nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it's it's ... it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well let's say you know like most of these things there was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having caused what's their\nPersonal liberty um but I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize that even though you know this is a part of Spain where it tends to bring quite a lot\nThat's on the Atlantic side of the same um people tend to get into their cars whenever it's raining and lots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulance says well\nYou know all all of them can get in the city and there are also taxes you know the rule is is quite strange to me the mayor said to me if he wanted to get married and they also do the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where I was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old says she's just very very difficult to park so the reality is in my business to survive better\nThan in some small towns or where you know they still allow cause upon it because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the the authorities combined the policy of banning card when those also banning\nThe building of big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which ten destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of ... what did he say about why he wanted to do that\nWell he you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb so that was uh the people didn't like going now that it was full of abandoned cars that were on drugs and ... and within the first month of come into office basically they cleaned it up and buying cars\nWhich is you know clearly something you know he said he'd been ... you know he's been researching into those for\nSome time before he took office\nAnd I think partly because he did it swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year":
