green sea turtles and monk seals today it is mostly underwater hurricane well lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally wiped Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only slippers of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane our last guy I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that I liked a head into French crickets shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures in here now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a\nUndergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles because um they their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being this Easter Island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtle nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north but some of the other ... there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised that the hurricane did as much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured that this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would\nI Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening uh\nOne of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or the other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in Northern Ireland uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd I'm so this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... says last year hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now taking a with for growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's dialing could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand\nUm was a moved by the hurricane to the north north east\nThe trade when waves may push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a fall in sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat ship fluctuate a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because the focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to rethink be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less growth it what did we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do in a fair comparison right I'm a very high growth rates in China we have very high growth states in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution all means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there it's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet right like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today\nHave you eaten more beans and meet right like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so I could not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not studies that you become part of movement that would do what anyone who is emphasizing any movement\nThat is trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is to sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nI don't have a provocative for its chance which is from our cat we get to\nLike many of the things I don't\nHave to be out for the for its chance which is from our cat\nWe get to know the woman behind one of the biggest political upsets of the year that's next time on the usa\n\nYou can hear Latino USA this evening at seven here on K.

he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around [noise]\nBoth that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar\nThere was the social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with that guitar it was like this magic wand that seem to\nBring every one together and so all along the guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know there's the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore was the first thing you know but it's something that sort of hanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that\nYou know like when I was in school I had to take a speech caught that like talk about a nightmare situation if you could only have hadn't interact with you yeah yeah I mean to be able to tell a thing as long as I've got that in my hands than everything's cool\nSo then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself into your well they're not at all you I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become\nJust another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early ...\nAnother aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and\nWith the dragon and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought now I got to get this together so a year later I tried it again and then I kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and\nIt started to feel like [noise] like music [noise]\nWell it seems like the right time to talk about I think [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the time like that's what comes to note or backwards the inspiration for\nThe notes because you say it's contributed condition the platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nPretty stars I meant to shine and that was something I quote unquote row these defined that book and the album ... and then made to shrink the when I wrote it I recognize that\nIt was a very very common court when prior\nTo the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York and I was like some of the music that I Would record it played that song and\nA guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was a really great version of Jessie J what what do you talk about I Know some people just drink any\nPlay view this recording and that was like oh my God that's the same ... almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and that was like\nYou know it's just an old traditional songs like I'd probably hurt the Kingston Trio play it when I was five years old or something like a market and the ... yeah and I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's a\nYou know it's like a public domain kind of a thing and then there's so much music flipped around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing or am I remembering it or what is it [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to see\n\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one or that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustained and then I went\nThe other processing so they're sort of a drone\nOne now\nWas originally from the guitar and then that's going on\nOne now\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to like a five brought a title I think that's all that shit\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for just\nOne solo guitar sound na\nNa\n\nNa\nNa\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being\nSure what was going to happen you mean as you playing\nYeah well the composing is you know happy now these are pieces they'd never feel like they're finished anyway but what I Do to prepare for the\nAlbum was actually played six night at the stone in New York every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with either old compositions of mind or new ones and\nI tried to keep myself just off balance for the whole week\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the\nStudio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for companies you're thinking would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentionally\nWell but that's when this really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming and you jump off a cliff\nAnd you you just start flying in that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take these chances but actually jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen if you play a wrong no\nWell okay if you know you get all the thrill but

I'm Peter O'Dowd\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm ...\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new detail in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump what's bringing Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nAnd parents identifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast\nAnd also they charge in two thousand two for a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy and has passed and we also know he's a registered Republican\nYou said that he has a disparate belong criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nAnd we are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man's so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of the devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether a this suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bonds did not explode a was one of the big question leading up to the arrest or was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that's something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it not handle it call histories and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber\nOr wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play and has making these devices\nAre once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings that's happening at the bottom of the hour carry the arrests do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this right now we know that Cesar ... the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it are on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspects because of course there were images\nOf the president there were also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in the investigation but do we know anything about why investigators a came and got to that than\nWe do know that these are say I was taken into custody in\nDo anything about why investigators or came and got to that than\nWe do know that these are saying I was taken into custody in or near an auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing this white van and transporting it up possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities\nHave not on the record get connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual that involve federal and local authorities\nAcross multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of this story a Republican strategist Allison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you\nThank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nA feeder a ... a out when to start with you know how suspects are in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and I bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political lens ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause\nOf this or the motive of of this is a ... this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wide to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to rightly claimed and called this despicable a despicable act of political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states\nYou know I'm Sorry to interrupt you ... do you want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to a really want him to try um I have been supplied it so far uh that every time you spoken out on the words that are about something you said like so and then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or something\nThat was to blame on the victims like the media or you know tries to lessen this in some way to make light of it in some way and I think the president um his job right now it's not all of his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nUm do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and awkward has\nIs health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other sources of their disposal they were protected it you know image toward the attorney general Jeff Sessions called ... older to make sure he was going to be okay this is a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just for the words but also with actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those deals\nTo reach out and not just with words but also with the actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do home the on the the male bombings or bombs were addressed um but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of into than he is apparently a Trump supporter\nWho how would you as a Republican strategist Alex advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm and consistent message and as Jamal said it and needs not be Justin word but also an action that we were in the you're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a journal absolutely how do you think Democrats should deal with it\n[noise] I think Democrats would do the same light it isn't a time to play all the things I wa disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using for the last year and a half a couple of years regards the media lock her up and all the chance all the things that we are only ... through the mall disagree with those\nThe human county library welcomes Laurie bean who will be present in Yuma woman's history on Helen Thomas spent its founder of Thomas ... it'll be tomorrow it ten am at the heritage library which is located at three in the south through the avenue in Yuma if you'd like more information you can reach us at night to eat three

moving with stones Broncos moving with him he desperately holding out for the clean water\nMight be her with the water crisis next time I'm living on her from the ... [noise] Monday evening at ... the eighty nine ... than\nThe uh the the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was hang with us if you can uh NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department is remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan\nGeoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time the age at the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package\nAnd there may be other such devices out there we've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate um they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there\nThey also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything as for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Caesar say a crumb South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address a use of these suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging\nWho have been an address to use a V. suspicious packages and that's one hand test to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand with already the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement is confirmed that that man is either say fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrests followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and carry jumped and you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mailed to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California\nHe says we're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident and Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at that uh recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions that you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but the so far the the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president\nI'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people a former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days of course on some of the targets\nOr intended recipient of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted\nIntended for the former director of national intelligence James Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet with outlet\nHave all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all ... exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of the packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages images that you've seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teach in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University in Virginia a new country there are a mere yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of the scene and have described as as Carrie Jones did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either did suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a copycat as often happens in case\nFrom either ... or somebody connected with this ... or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like the\nYeah yeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know ... it's obviously are easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or are they common and so it's really going to take a a a close\nLook by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect over copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of by the FBI the FBI a lab all back in the field office\nLooking at the actual forensics so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah [noise] oh that's\nThat's a great question I mean I I think as a as a couple of games so ... got a a interrogate destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of how forthcoming is\nHow you know what his ... what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative than the electronic out but it's if you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat might give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a gun and initial interrogation um and and you should have a good idea of how far does go on with this particular suspect but then there's all the question of\nAgain isn't working with someone else or tracking down any potential each other a associates that may have been helping\nIts ... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it would be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the rent that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political decals apparently pro Trump ... expense details on the side of it do we know is for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the sense that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding or on the idea that it is somehow connected to this aspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when I knew conference aren't as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he do say that the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old have daily Florida where he is he right\nNow he is in federal custody I he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as I'm already are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds I Want to say thank you dilute
