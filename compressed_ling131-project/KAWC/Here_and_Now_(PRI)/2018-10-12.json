inspection of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for the immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen self how is that possible\nUh well that's a good question you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that need it to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents in so many cells I think that was a sense of of urgency is needed to be addressed\nFor should we imply then that that many people inside the facility worst suicidal or or could they have been for some other reason making those\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told the inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would unfurl the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was ... you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for a year since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general uh highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nYou know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for a year since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of untimely inadequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation\nAnd you know the thing about an immigration detention is it supposed to be what they called civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive a that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamped their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to ... their teeth I'm is what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\n\nMy my ... next time on that you know

the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting it's similar to the post what are you hearing\nYeah these are it's a source close to touch investigation of said turkey has caught stokes meant that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored murder Jamal ... she went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that I'm On course official position is still that and to show gee is missing about that a touch intelligence knows for sure that he was mud\nI'm not a backstop the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern e\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that\nAnd they're very gruesome details coming out things leading recordings allegedly of him being beaten I'm On some reports that his body was this men but I'm the Saudi or official Saudi authorities are still flatly denying all the allegation how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this strange communication strategy with this government here in techie where they don't really speak directly to foreign media for example they and they don't\nActually have a ... kind of communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moon pie towards that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach except for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here\nTo be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation or the Saudis had proposed\nThat is the tux playing nights and saying that we're going to we don't want to build on diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead king\nI'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and therefore tightening the screws on the Saudis and try and get the ... western backing for the ... position the question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible\nIt can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and and I think it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a a diplomatic nice city on the politics of attacks entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their espresso allegation and there is\nSome more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or\nAre people noting that at all the biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by techie watches such as a spot and\nUh you know that said at techies not treating journalists in the same way as a journalist is alleged to be traced it that it's not even know if my mother during hey we're talking about\nUh how tech is locked up on this which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective\nBe noted particularly by techie ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalists in the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged to be increasing that it's not even know if my mother during hey we're talking about\nUh how tech is locked up on this which is obviously a also an attack on press freedom in completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there in his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware\nThat it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage\nBought a I think that you know clearly tech he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its sovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today\nA U.S pastor Andrew Brunson\nHeld in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that [noise]\nYeah this is a country that produces more news than I can see I'm ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in a massive Punjab the failed coup here in twenty sixteen\nAccused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government has always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president dad one has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of the ... century which is seen as laughable bike by critics of tacky and what's happened today that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which\nBasically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of massive friction between the U.S and and ... governments sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency ah that is not expected to east to some extent and it will be seen\nMost likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's more glowing and assemble thank you so much pleasure\nNow back to

or as a writer and the guardian put it after reading Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep\nNot sleeping has been making me stupid or fatter unhappy airport sicker were said sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiative he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be extended to upper class in as well\n... is with us in the studio welcome thank you very much he was just telling us at Harvard with so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took his online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWere they were a pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of students uh took the corps and students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the same particular program well\nWhat are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but the the sand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah a ... of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that has actually hack of times where the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean the\nThe football team has and getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say eight o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is a set up for the students staying up on a\nLot of extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving the light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets or circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it goes so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock sends the strongest strive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution ah we couldn't see during the nighttime and the brand send a powerful waking signal\nThat is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky and that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest strive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution a we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brain send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times on the west where it\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell there's that we talked about some of the health issues that arise just rats sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths\nWilling and Matthew Walker his book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer and dementia\nIn ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attack and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you interested Bill Clinton sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you\nOnly do they measure appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcome\nCould lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how can they this to students and it's part of the culture to see you know can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one it's a very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming that can get more\n... free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules they don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found that those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they\nWere shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder that they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or where they're trying to pay it\nAnd one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually the internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found that those who

take the test or when they're trying to pay attention to the middle of the night\nWow so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep maybe an obvious thing and not have a steady group when am\nI right so when I have a teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar has to make its head like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student ... between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity and the first\nAh scheduled activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you working now we're talking to you most typically that students that you've got to sleep matters initiated from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters you took this probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury used have as many disability days and then you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because sleep and we'll probably similar to sit here and out of work\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour in detail so we did a sleep disorder screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires away identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders and we were for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for this you can't breathe and sleep at the same time\n\nIt's eleven thirty nine and you were listening to here and now on listener supported gay WC eighty eight point nine FM\nDecember libraries celebrating the ...

... well what's happened to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it looked at all and I think some will be dead and others will be inside at the city itself\nAbuses that you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a show old older to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up they offered them a way out whether they would be bus stop to it lip\nAnd that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive around that area as we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThe last two in the hot out of the country is done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus you grow up to places like the area rounded lip than you can really see walk the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nWell so what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that have you know taken advantage of the situation there he had the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand

there will be the end of this sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interests at Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nEssentially the
