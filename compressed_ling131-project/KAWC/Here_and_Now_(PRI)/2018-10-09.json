K. bench Patrick\nWe are all here yet at Justin Paul hello there even Lance and hello\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to\nSort of claim that they were closer with him and they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friend and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of change in him Steven Livingston\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything you've always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well um she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\nHow you were able to put those feelings into a song\nHeartbreaking and it's heartbreaking to hear ... mother are struggling single mom when she finds out evidence been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\nHow you were able to feeling the effects on what's it like now these are my novel you don't have music to get these characters\nYou know it's true that we talked a lot about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nYeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any a sleep on this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... and really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of ... students were the ends in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had sweaty hair [laughter]\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands out to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being here becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge [laughter] given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you I got I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of errors in a in a mission they gave me to tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experience joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out just a crushing thing that happened to him and some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but to you\nWe get to know more about life before that and part of his life\nHe did he did he ever experience joy I'm or was it all\nYou know I'm darkness they don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out is ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about countered you want to imagine more about Connor and\nI think what we found in the book um especially without treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for kind\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nIt's expected to make landfall and Florida's panhandle

Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidences but continue to this day\nCan't deal is is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned it to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were eager to that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a severe infection on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSo you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to have a cat\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty homogenous quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nImpressed that the people who work with ah the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more western or European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were\nThe ... and it's quite community how has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've been impressed\nThat the people who work with ah the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate but the show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties [noise] in the ah ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seems to have an immigrant story they married someone from outside Greece leaves was workers you're talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for I mean personally what is it like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration\nIn the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two and to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhillip ... thank you actually so\nThat's Dr Phil can deal is who is part of the George Washington global mental health program

question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document it's an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as a cover a secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty senses\nAnd ... he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the
