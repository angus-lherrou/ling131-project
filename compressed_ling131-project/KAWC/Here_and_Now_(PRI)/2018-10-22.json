former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a ... you know some kind of a\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could see Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently see and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this is going to change President Trump's

year and now over the weekend the Philadelphia Inquirer gave its reluctant endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez an end as is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races\nYou get in the paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race is a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nGerman so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in a mist trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syrians on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party that Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about just [noise]\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nAbove you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not wise was re times for drugs that those cancer patients politically\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes has called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nSo gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump a factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nParty in the past from the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump a factor compared with ... Mendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you've been tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nBut a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty\nPretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this rates it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\n[noise] that is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got to\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with a federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why rock of member station WBUR a member station K. U. W. reports progress is slow\nThe Washington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represent survivor who\nTwice wasn't hurt who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the street\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested it didn't solve the problem now there is a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water to pieces emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process them more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like a well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow corner doors so this again this is the biology lab during the laboratory supervisor Christians labor stands in front of the rooms glass window on the other side a scientist is testing of rape you can see the\nWhite box that's close to the window so with the paper bags we'd ...\nThey're filled with material and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after a rate\nThat this lab robots help tested samples for DNA these are our robots they have names like a B.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important\nWhere teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shapes on a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go online social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens um have a smartphone now\nAnd it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to you and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jen is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um service that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high school they go to a more diverse much more likely to have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped the generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to them\nThat hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\n[noise] yeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults\nBut in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors is very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety\nAnd I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say that they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so\nUm well I think because there's so many other things to do there's always the possibility of a\nYou know something new to say on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interview that I did a lot of teens you know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general [noise] um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think yeah smarts is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older ... and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this

S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the mid term he's\nNot only said without evidence that they're criminals he's even said that they are terrorists uh he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they're about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about in Mexico sending rapists this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here he is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\nVote again a very major tax cut from Italy company [noise]\nAnd if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say that have ever\nHave made your tax guy we are going to be putting in [noise] and are setting very deeply right now around the block a major attack for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even a session a right now and November is coming\nRight now around the block a major attack for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress hasn't in session as you said they can vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke RMC polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWe felt that he was on the university to provide the because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic affects everybody\nOthers question if it could encourage drug use that story plus\nThe fallout from Jamal 'cause she'll she's staff this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nWe hope you can join us for all things considered this afternoon from three to six here on K.

worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night but it would happen to those girls\nSome managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha how ... ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nThe yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we owe the kid the access with the government consent and the only way to do it but they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the girls about what had happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram\nAm partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the go to a released in may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite well they um with still protesting what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not count says to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he couldn't be any time we were alone with the go to the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so to vote I think the government will say I wanted to manage how the rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because\nThey were held a three is this little ... and was down and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his they did give his diaries discreetly\nIt and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't did that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they call the and the full ... treatment ... ah and then the phone what we do is the uh the ... who had taken lead actually just the tip of ...\nAnd in the film what we do is the uh the girls that that you vote girls who were taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of go in Nigeria who was taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid says I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and then the phone that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the ... like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she ... she says I Would say months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast that had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have a pet who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up on and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will ... ah people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been cannot but they're just fled their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is it functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will run into town than these tickled him id become a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on the Web the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that way you have to them\nTheir their outcomes but then a lot of the I Love the timing displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people have come\nThere is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled the Nigerian military\nAnd their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line was dying you just don't know why the threat is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI'm ... and has changed my life now and I think in the nation I mean ... he's All

networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\nThrough more on Fox afterward well what do we fought for the gateway listen ... take on prime time with a five minute we can recap if I say\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google three\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty seconds ...\nPackage as entertainment or new show\nOn let's take this first changed Fox is calling it the night and he's nine second sixty second breast or I'd be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means ... traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block a brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy or brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet or they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nThan your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works uh right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent them pretty nice cars by the way yes you can\nInstantly you have a car you locate it from the phone on lock the doors and try and you can rent them pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go at something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing a mechanical I turn it on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like Toyota over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nSpeaking of labor and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it's taught him was cars that drove it to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues that eventually strangers you know it makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were fifty years out and autonomy as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Yuma", "day": "22"}
