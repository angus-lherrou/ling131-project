year and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers welcome back to her now\nGlad to be with your Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it [noise]\nSeen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one\nAnd this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major alienation of major

between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one\nAnd this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major alienation of major allies I Can't imagine\nThese are ... relatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing as it was\nThis has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement\nFrom simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was\nProfoundly troubled by the old agreement should be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted in our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are\nTiny compared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained this has been the most short sighted\nOf strategies for the most negligible day\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship\nIt seems to me the strategies we have used to go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese sauna road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which is surely the most effective way\nTo influence Chinese behavior I think that any\nConscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these tariffs that work\nThat any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nThey're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes they are taxes the fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs that companies need in order to compete\nThat's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient\nAnd so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting\nFocusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of President Trump\nIs clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist buddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear\nOf a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with it and indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline\nAnd therefore he is able to a rally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions to stand by his side\nYou know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well [noise]\nWhat do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates

long time too\nIs doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest

being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence

inspired in part by books like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blog podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then let's\nLet Scott tell it he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome Hi thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete ad me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that podcast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I'm imagining the home Scott nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that what was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town and our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know beyond\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plugged the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in art eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nKnow it's funny I personally really like my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a ...\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what did you and your wife did just to keep the story going it's it's a major part of this fire move and it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive tempt you in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement\nHaven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nAh [laughter] you know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat\nFire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance but the yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know and then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're centrally betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big Gibson dives\nAnd if you can ride those way that you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized there was as easy as I said it and forget it that was really really a an entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this and there's a sort of a goal in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable with some of the things you were doing\nYeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that our quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was\nAbsolutely miserable and we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable with some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents out maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the ... and our parents face and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but

Smith who a Ford says was there\nA include drinking is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which ah his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces\nFord gave that's exactly right it does it does loosely I Will say that you know there is a one of the things that's important to note and one of the reasons I think this has become such a partisan fight is that there's a lot of gray area around a lot of this but yes that July first gatherings specifically includes\nMark judge who am I just referred a guy named PJ ... Smith who a Ford says was there\nA include drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which ah his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer which is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ...\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that\nRefers to flatulence sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same for the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence ... age sixteen hundred year book page on 'em game until about that's not what proved means well it's\nSort of unclear what moved means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says that moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kevin uh about another term and is your book devil's triangle areas devil's triangle\nDrinking game as it played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYou're quite quarters you know okay it's a quarter scare what about\nThat one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary of and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is a made up game of quarters with three cups or engineer triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could that explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nA books that they have an ... I went back and look the contemporaneous news reports you know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either move or devil's triangle the the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually from temporary and he's uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objective lean categorically or but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing as mental reviewed an allegation that he says only one\nThey were used were actually from temporary and he's uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objective leaned categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had may\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened if you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCan you answer that question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking no wonder why okay thank you so Chad\n... is a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nAh I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be incapacitated\nA and there are lots of suggestions ah from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some regularity and high school\nOr gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which is that he doesn't he never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of disadvantage for happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake that senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "02"}
