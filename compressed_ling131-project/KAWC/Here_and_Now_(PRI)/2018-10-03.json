George Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize let's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university\nUh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\nSo first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as\nSearch applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\n[noise] so\nFirst of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own process season that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell or being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this works significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a a simple cell as we might think of that and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds like we do chemistry in a beaker a flask\nWe control of fewer of ah the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we'll ultimately observe\nBut you know you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple Baker\nHad some real breakthroughs here are to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary process as it is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications all this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in\nSo imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions that do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enable us to um\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process are created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the ... or a generates a as an all or alcohol and the production of beer or wine\nOkay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had\nBut doing it in these um these organisms the label us to uh take advantage of their natural process sees an example um all the natural ... process\nOr created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the ... or or generate some ethanol alcohol and the production of beer or wine\nOkay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm you're away from him so perhaps some projects protected from the images on the slopes as kind of happened today\nAnd I can't reach life for that I Love when mom [laughter]\nOr as a for instance Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna strict Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that meeting for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] willing I'll also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year\nUm and but you're absolutely right and the tapes of professor Arnold\n... she's the fifth woman's and prior to that it was ... Hodgkin's in Nineteen sixty fourth that was recognized and then you start going way back to Marie Curie and Nineteen uh Lebanon and actually her daughter um several uh two decades later so\nFor us in the American Chemical Society where we're at ... for me personally we're really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter ... is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas Oh thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a ...

Ford said in your testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged saw with the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was flip through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin\nThe largest unsolved art heist in history was an an apple pie August\nIt's here and now it was the part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault with the laughter from her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said\nAt my expense my friend said when you heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried if that memory a lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lassie Ford and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline report it in the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand called seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and below heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from the weeks prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago first day on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing are we ... we had a caller tell us that they have their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual fault I'm so the symptoms and stress reactions of trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if they are right back in that moment they if\nFeel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly that is the head of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and our nose and this friend\nAnd it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly that is the head of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I don't know the friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd his friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex and do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being\nOf being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fight or we're going to fleet and what policy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less that intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with we usually people\nHave a flashback she's also explain to the people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know what we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain\nTo literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way well\nSome of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to and what that was exactly like for her but yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg

daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her ... then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get or don't remember when I don't remember\nI don't know\nBrett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that did happen Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including

feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victim remain and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma\nIs being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and it's so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors\nAnd it's a part of trauma and so to
