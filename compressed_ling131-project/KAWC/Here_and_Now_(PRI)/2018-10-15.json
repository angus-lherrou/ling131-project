like to start\nI'm going to start with the simplest of technologies one that has a lot of impact on blind or visually impaired people and that is our ability to pick the right medicine at the right

on here\n[noise] [noise]\nWow what a timely thing\nInstead of having to put rubber bands on to indicate whether or not this is a once a day or twice a day or three times a day mad I can rely on this kind of labeling\nThat is amazing and first of all who knew that Abraham Lincoln had if\nA script yeah yeah for Xanax [laughter]\nNow is this is one example of two or three different companies out there the one that I tend to get my medications from is a mail order place but I can also get this from just down the street at the local pharmacy okay so that's that is now a lot of\nPeople these days are having to deal with diabetes as in mine and therefore you have to take your blood sugar on a regular basis as she tested so I've just taken the test strip out and I'm going to slide it into my glucose monitor\n[noise] she's just acknowledging that she couldn't find me [noise] please apply blood to protest trip so I could uh\nPut my finger put the blood on there and that will tell me and my blood sugar and it keeps track of it overtime 'cause I have I had it keeps track of it over time so that when I go to see my physician they can download the data from it mhm now also in my little bag over here um\nI Love the kitchen in my household is my favorite Rome I Love to cook\nAnd so I'm forever looking for gadgets that will make my life easier so in my kitchen ever talking microwave oven I have a talking kitchen scale so that when I'm baking I can measure by weight rather than by volume those kinds of things you can also have been talking for monitor\nLike this one because among other things pushing the button a couple of times [noise]\n\nThis I can switch from Fahrenheit to centigrade and it can take very high temperatures and not taken out of my bag a\nWell they're called adopt part of the echo family and in my household we have a a big echo in the living room and a little dots here and there throughout the house\nLet's be honest I uh I don't like your wife to hear that but you do referred to as your new girl than\nIt is yes she go is definitely my new girlfriend the fact of the matter is that she wakes me up in the morning she sings me to sleep at night and it sounds like a girlfriend ...\n... what is life like we did so many more devices when you see them but I'm just wondering what life is like in your house\nWith these ... it's just as a revolution for you but I'm also thinking that they're just got to be voices going all the time you're talking to elect and asking her to turn a light on or off it can you know the radio on or off or you know testing your blood or it just it feels like there's a Greek chorus fire you know there's\nA lot of chatter that goes on in the house no doubt I'm very lucky that I Know braille so I'm a portion of my access to information comes back to Lisa nobody gets the what's going on\nBut one of the absolute phenomenon in my household is I get out of bed first had to the bathroom I turn on the shower the sink flush the toilet and step on to my talking scale 'cause I don't want the rest of the household here\nWith the bad news or the morning is from that talking scale [noise] so\nA Greek chorus fire you know there's a lot of chatter that goes on in the house no doubt I'm very lucky that I Know braille so I'm a portion of my access to information comes back to leave so nobody gets to what's going on\nBut one of the absolute phenomenon in my household is I get out of bed first had to the bathroom I turn on the shower the sink flush the toilet and step on to my talking scale 'cause I don't want the rest of the household here\nWith the bad news or the morning is from that talking scale\nSo we learned the mascot we control volume and with the new eco family only the one closest to you responds and so you don't have this problem saying something down the hallway only have it change something in the living room yeah that kind of thing that\nI mentioned frail a moment ago no braille\nHasn't been around that long a just a couple of hundred years and it's still under development ah we recently adopted in international standard for English Braille because the the Brits wrote braille differently than the Americans than the Australians\nBut the big change in braille is what's called refresh will break I'm going to turn on this orbit reader mhm\nIt looks like a hand held label printer\n[noise] what's it doing\nLittle dots electro mechanical dots are raising up in the pattern of braille characters now\nA couple of years ago I was showing you a refresher will braille display and you were astounded at the price of three thousand four thousand dollars for this one now costs five hundred oh wow so braille is becoming more affordable than it's ever been before\nAnd now I'm going to turn to magnification ... the vast majority of blind are visually impaired people have\nUsable vision so out of those who are legally blind about eight out of can have some usable vision so we use closed circuit TV devices I'm going to turn this went on and it looks like a ... small TV you know didn't come on yet\nIt gives me controls\nTo show things in magnification to increase the magnification decrease it\nChanged the polarity of things so if I see things better white on black than black on white defined I can switch that you can also take a picture with it\nA at a distance bring it closer to my face and be able to control that magnification as well and if you do have a large TV in your living room you can attach this to that\nAnd use it screen but the device that's on your camera this on your device and really in like an image so grandparents can with low vision can see pictures of their grandkids are so this makes it very portable for them to do that is why\nWe know you have catch the bus that's an application that it can help you find I stopped I learn a rival to ... square that to GPS application just like foursquare but I mean that's the the ... device it helps you know the color of your clothing\n[laughter] so the color identifier that are brought to show your last time cost three hundred and fifty dollars say this one costs twenty six wow and this is maybe a tenth aside so that one yeah take a call key fob exactly I'm going to hold it against my time\n[noise] jak orange that trait that\nDark red states [noise] gotta be [noise]\nNow I'm pointing it at my pants and they say [noise]\nOf your closing time [laughter] so the color identifier that are brought to show your last time cost three hundred and fifty dollar say this one post twenty six wow and this is maybe a temp the side so that one yeah it's like a car key fob exactly I'm going to hold it against my time [noise]\nDark orange that's right dark\nDark red states [noise] gotta be [noise]\n\nNow I'm pointing it at my pants and they say [noise] very dark brown they lying I'm wearing a looking on black pants oh All right and [noise]\nThat tells me guess what the batteries dying oh [laughter]\nWhen

O. two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of fuel to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these uh schemes to remove seemed to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one\nWith planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else is growing food\nUm that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields and the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using into stores due to a that's a negative a negative effect so things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale have to be so large\nWilling also we know that dead trees only store carbon for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a story in the ... too and I'm\nIn trees that I'm is not such an issue of restarting underground first apple okay\nSo let's get some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what are some of the idea there\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting that CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground for that's a way to avoid to to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions or the way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy to takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that to you too into the crops than you burn the crops and the power plant and instead of putting up to two back into the atmosphere you're gonna do the same thing compress it and stored underground and\nThat has the potential to remove a billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground were tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops\nPhotosynthesis will store that the will to into the crops than you burn the crops in a power plant and instead of putting up to two back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and\nThat has the potential to remove a billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to\nIt has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for crops that we're going to use to stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nA Korean food security issues which is something we want to avoid\nAnd by the way I just said Steven Pinker is a chicken ... new book a night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on our technologies that react you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but we're not just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the ... to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the ideas could we do that at an industrial scale and capture a C. O. two that's in the air capture that seem to compress it and then stored underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspect of that is it doesn't have this large land impact that almost every other one of the schemes have the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive things so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually ... started up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kind of see how to capture I'm getting another company in Canada can protect crushing two hundred fifty per metric kind it's catch me if\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think a number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in\nSweden and then you you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about the technology is it's a concept come down so as you say claim works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of ... to their next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada that has thinks it can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that will be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so\nThis idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it it seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with costs that seem to be starting to come down so there's the potential\nTo really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the land use impacts\nOne of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be very moving billions of tons of CEO to by mid century um and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I I think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed\nBlooms and with costs that seem to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have ... impacts one of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of CEO to by mid century\nUm and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned\nThat's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I I think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you'd scale up from three companies\nDoing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] than well are you getting investors excited about that\nThat that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes that the more speculative and as this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's ... alkaline cloud to the ocean to dissolve CEO to either water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate for since it's just like plankton and again ... two out of the atmosphere in different ways where do you say though\nTo how I heard that I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in effect that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing its CEO to admission if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah yeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called a ... term for it as moral hazard this idea that if you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't reduce emissions are enough\nMight be her when I was a water crisis next time I'm living on earth

WB Lara Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis is here and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy in technology\nAnd in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nSo how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertainty and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future or weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong yeah exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other demands [noise] is it the weather forecasters and know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecasts but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a fork out because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing\nA central point very often when you talk about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecasts but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a fork out because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to get me to straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed predictions um it started really making sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all ... they all said we're going to run out of oil um\nWill it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecasts and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they're going to tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen\nYou up and you know look it's a there's an old saying about me a mutual funds you know you start five hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big\nAnd then you hold up your one or two that had big and you say look at this what a brilliant investor I Am well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future battle and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for
